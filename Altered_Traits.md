## The Deep Path and the Wide

**The Deep Path and The Wide Path of Meditation:**

**Background:**
- Steve Z, a lieutenant colonel working in the Pentagon, experienced PTSD after the 9/11 attacks
- His story is an example of mindfulness meditation providing relief from emotional disorders (Level 3, wide approach)
- However, the original aim of meditation was for deep exploration of the mind (Level 1, deep path)

**Deep Path:**
*Level 1:*
  - Pure form: ancient lineages of Theravada Buddhism, Tibetan yogis
  - Intensive practice focused on profound alteration of being

*Level 2:*
  - Meditation adapted for Western culture
  - Leaves behind certain parts of the original Asian source

**Wide Path:**
*Level 3:*
  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and Transcendental Meditation (TM)
  - Widely distributed and taught in clinics, medical centers, and beyond

*Level 4:*
  - Most watered-down forms of meditation
  - Accessible to the largest number of people via mindfulness at your desk or meditation apps

**Future Possibilities:**
*Level 5:*
  - Innovations and adaptations from studying all other levels
  - Widest benefit for mental health (explored in final chapter)

**Our Background:**
- Dan and Richie have been close friends, collaborators on meditation science since the 1970s
- Practitioners of meditation over the years
- Dan: seasoned science journalist, wrote for New York Times
- Richie: neuroscientist, heads University of Wisconsin's Center for Healthy Minds and brain imaging laboratory, conducts research on meditators with cutting-edge technology

**Collaboration:**
- Coauthoring a book together
- Delighted to share their research and insights on the true benefits and aim of meditation practice

### THE DEEP PATH

**The Deep Path: Altered Traits from Meditation**

* **Early Challenges**
  * Richie faced opposition at Harvard for his interest in meditation research due to past negative experiences with Leary and Alpert's psychedelic experiments.
  * Skepticism from clinical psychology professors regarding the validity and relevance of mantra-based meditation research.
* **The Concept of Altered Traits**
  * Beyond temporary benefits, meditation practices can lead to enduring character changes (altered traits).
  * These qualities shape daily life outside of meditation practice.
* **Early Pursuit of Altered Traits**
  * Dan's experiences in India and attempts to introduce meditation research in contemporary psychology.
  * Richie's decades-long scientific investigation into the effects of meditation on altered traits.
* **Contemplative Neuroscience and Findings from Deep Path Practitioners**
  * Emergence of a new field, contemplative neuroscience.
  * Research on altered traits in highly seasoned practitioners (Tibetan yogis) has confirmed the existence of profound brain changes.
* **The Importance of the Deep Path**
  * Focus on lasting character changes rather than temporary benefits like better health or business performance.
  * Cultivating qualities such as selflessness, equanimity, loving presence, and impartial compassion through deep meditation practices.
* **Scientific Confirmation of Altered Traits**
  * Initial lack of backing for the concept of altered traits based on intuition and ancient texts.
  * Decades of research in Richie's lab showing brain function differences between deep practitioners and non-practitioners.
* **Awakening: The Goal of the Deep Path**
  * Seems like a fairy tale to modern sensibility but is supported by scientific findings.
  * Remarkable positive alterations in brain and behavior along the lines of deep path practices are real.

### THE WIDE PATH

**The Wide Path: Blending Science and Ancient Practices**

* The Mind and Life Institute: An organization promoting dialogues between Dalai Lama and scientists
* "Destructive emotions" dialogue in 2000
* Dalai Lama's challenge: Apply time-tested practices to science, test rigorously, and spread widely if effective
* Richie's refocused research on the deep and wide paths of emotional wellbeing
* Center for Healthy Minds: Applications suitable for schools, clinics, businesses, etc.
* Dalai Lama's challenge catalyzed scientific studies on meditation

**The Wide Path Goes Viral: Mindfulness, Scientific Lens, and Questions**

* Enthusiasm for mindfulness and other meditation practices
* Questions when studying meditation from a scientific perspective:
  * When does it work?
  * Who does it help?
  * How is it different from exercise?
* Meditation: Umbrella term for various contemplative practices
* Benefits depend on specific practice
* Practical advice for starting a meditation practice:
  * Find a practice that appeals to you
  * Decide on realistic daily practice time
  * Try it for a month and evaluate benefits
* Regular practice leads to improved mental fitness
* Specific benefits strengthen with increased hours of practice.

### A CAUTIONARY TALE

**Cautionary Tale:**
- Swami X, a meditation teacher from Asia who claimed extraordinary abilities, approached Harvard researchers during the mid-1970s, boasting of his yogic prowess and seeking scientific confirmation.
- Harvard researchers were excited about biofeedback technology, which could provide instant information on physiological functions such as blood pressure, enabling people to make healthier adjustments.
- Swami X claimed he could control these functions without feedback, but during testing, he was unable to lower or raise his blood pressure consistently and accused the researchers of serving him "toxic tea."
- Physiological tracings revealed Swami X's inability to perform the mental feats he had boasted about and even put himself into atrial fibrillation using a method called "dog samadhi."
- Subsequent investigation revealed that Swami X was actually a former manager of a shoe factory who had abandoned his family to seek fortune in America.

**Meditation Research: Current Scenario:**
- Despite the cautionary tale, the mindfulness movement has gained widespread popularity in recent years and reached various aspects of modern life.
- The reach of meditation is expanding in schools, businesses, and private lives (wide approach).
- However, there are concerns about how scientific data is often distorted or exaggerated for commercial purposes.
- Misrepresentations, questionable claims, or distortions of scientific studies are used to sell meditation.

**Questionable Claims:**
- Some common claims about the benefits of meditation include thickening the prefrontal cortex while shrinking the amygdala, shifting emotional set points, slowing aging, and treating various diseases like diabetes and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
- While some findings may stand up to further scrutiny, others have methodological issues that require more testing and corroboration before firm claims can be made.

**Research Limitations:**
- The studies used to support these claims have limitations, such as inaccurate methods for measuring amygdala volume or unclear impact of meditation on aging due to complex treatment regimens involving diet, exercise, and meditation.
- Social media and hyperbolic ad copy are rife with such claims, making it crucial to maintain a clear-eyed, scientific perspective.

**Approach research findings with a skeptical mindset**
- This book offers a comprehensive exploration of various aspects of meditation research and their implications, providing a more nuanced understanding of the potential benefits at different levels (beginner, long-term, and "Olympic").
- The future holds great promise for further discoveries that could benefit individuals and society as a whole.

### THE ACCELERATION

**Transcendentalism and Meditation:**
- Early interest in Eastern inner arts in the 1830s by Thoreau, Emerson, and their fellow American Transcendentalists.
- First English translations of ancient spiritual texts from Asia.
- Lack of instruction or method for practices.
- More serious engagement started in the late 20th century with teachers from the East and Westerners traveling to study meditation in Asia.

**Scientific Studies on Meditation:**
- Research on meditation began publishing in the 1970s.
- In 2016, there were 1,113 publications in the English language scientific literature.
- Notable acceleration of research since 2014.

**Priming the Field:**
- Francisco Varela, a Chilean-born neuroscientist and meditation practitioner, played a crucial role in fostering collaboration between scientists and meditators.
- First Summer Research Institute (SRI) held in 2004, with a mission to further rigorous study of meditation.
- Mind and Life Institute was founded in 1987 by the Dalai Lama, Francisco, and Adam Engle.
- Varela research awards granted by the Mind and Life Institute have leveraged over $60 million in follow-on funding.

**Neural and Biological Benefits of Meditation:**
- Booming popularity of meditation.
- Headlines often focus on short daily practice benefits.
- Far greater possibilities, including altered traits and changes in the brain.

**Historical Background:**
- Transcendentalists flirted with Eastern inner arts in the 1830s.
- Lack of instruction or method for practices.
- Early 20th century: Freud advised psychoanalysts to adopt an "even-hovering attention" during therapy, but no method was offered.
- Late 20th century: Westerners began traveling to Asia to study meditation and teachers from the East arrived in the West, paving the way for more serious engagement with these practices.

**Scientific Research on Meditation:**
- Publication count on meditation research increased significantly since the 1970s.
- Annual publication numbers for 2014, 2015, and 2016 were 925, 1,098, and 1,113, respectively.

**Collaboration between Science and Contemplative Practice:**
- Francisco Varela saw the potential for collaboration between scientists and meditators.
- Mind and Life Institute was founded in 1987 to facilitate this collaboration.
- The first Summer Research Institute (SRI) was held in 2004, with a mission to further the rigorous study of meditation.

**Impact of Meditation on Neural and Biological Systems:**
- Meditation has been shown to alter biology and emotional life for the better.
- Scientific studies reveal various levels of benefits depending on the amount of practice.
- Higher levels of practice have led to altered traits and changes in the brain that were previously unobserved by science.

**Personal Background:**
- Decades-long friendship between the authors, driven by a shared sense of a greater purpose.
- Persistence despite obstacles in pursuit of this goal.

## Chapter 2: Ancient Clues

**A Personal Journey to Encountering Two Unforgettable Spiritual Masters**

**November 1970 in Bodh Gaya:**
- Dan's encounter with an elderly Tibetan monk, Khunu Lama
- Misty morning at the stupa near the Bodhi Tree
- Dan's friends introduced him to Khunu Lama

**Khunu Lama (Mahamuni):**
- **Elderly Tibetan Monk**
- Humble, kind, and gentle presence
- Known for his spiritual status among all schools of Tibetan practice
- Sparse, unheated cell with no personal belongings
- Spent long hours reading texts and welcoming visitors
- Fabled humility: declined monastery offer for larger quarters
- Taught compassionate life to the Dalai Lama (mentor)
- Dan's experience contrasted with his clinical psychology studies focusing on negatives

**Dan's Background:**
- Studied Clinical Psychology at Harvard
- Encounters with Indian Yogi, Neem Karoli Baba
- Inspired by Ram Dass, a devotee of Neem Karoli Baba
- Received Harvard Predoctoral Traveling Fellowship to India in fall 1970

**Neem Karoli Baba (Maharaji):**
- Indian Yogi Dan met during Christmas break from Harvard classes in 1968
- Known as the guru of Ram Dass
- Famous in the West for transforming devotees like Ram Dass
- Itinerant sadhu with no fixed schedule or organization
- No particular possessions: wore white dhoti and heavy woolen plaid blanket
- Appeared always at peace and kind to everyone, regardless of status
- Able to remain in a state of ongoing quiet rapture and love

### BEYOND THE PARADIGM

**Beyond the Paradigm:** Discovering Mindfulness in India

**Background:**
- Dan's two-month journey to Bodh Gaya, India, with Jeff and a sadhu
- Arrival at the Burmese vihara in Bodh Gaya in November 1970

**Major Figures:**
1. **Joseph Goldstein:** Former Peace Corps worker and long-term American resident studying under Anagarika Munindra since 1966.
2. **Anagarika Munindra:** Meditation master from the Barua caste in Bengal who studied vipassana under Burmese masters.
3. **S.N. Goenka:** Jovial, paunchy former businessman turned meditation teacher. Learned vipassana from U Ba Khin and taught ten-day retreats at the vihara.

**Vihara (Burmese Pilgrim's Rest House):** A pilgrimage site for Buddhists; built before military dictatorship took over in Burma, few pilgrims due to travel restrictions.

**Meditation:**
1. **Vipassana:** The Theravadan meditation method and root source of many mindfulness practices.
2. **Samadhi:** Altered state reached through meditation; one-pointed concentration.
3. **Insight (Vipassana):** Awareness that reveals attachment to sensations, beyond noting the stream of sensations.

**Key Developments:**
1. Dan's immersion in ten-day retreats led by Goenka and his fellow travelers became a seminal moment for spreading mindfulness around the world.
2. Detailed instructional booklets (mimeographed handbooks) from Mahasi Sayadaw provided practical guidance on transforming the mind.
3. The convergence of spiritual literature throughout Eurasia described an internal liberation, contrasted with modern psychology's limited focus.

**Dan's Personal Journey:**
1. Developed a twice-daily meditation habit in college but found deeper insights through Goenka's teachings.
2. Wrote an article proposing the existence of a lasting ultra-benign mode of consciousness before traveling to India.
3. Upon returning from India, Dan intended to introduce his colleagues at Harvard to mindfulness practices and the potential for inner transformation.

### THE MAKING OF A REBEL

**The Making of a Rebel: Richie's Journey in Psychology**

**Background:**
- Most Indian vehicles have religious portraits in the driver's seat, making it a mobile puja table.
- Dan, an American student at Harvard after returning from India, had such a "puja" with images of spiritual leaders in his VW van.

**Meeting Richie:**
- They met during a psychophysiology seminar in 1972.
- Both wanted to document the benefits of meditation through their dissertation research.
- Dan offered Richie a ride home and they discovered shared interests.

**Richie's Background:**
- Early interests in consciousness were stifled during his psychology studies at New York University due to behaviorist dominance.
- Dropped an abnormal psychology course that strictly adhered to the behaviorist view.
- Became a rebel by focusing on studying the mind instead of reinforcement schedules for animals.

**Early Explorations:**
- Volunteered at Maimonides Medical Center, learning EEG monitoring techniques.
- Conducted research on daydreaming and obesity with his senior honors thesis adviser, Judith Rodin.
- Used physiological measures to infer mental processes, a radical method at the time.

**Struggles in Mainstream Research:**
- Secured his first academic position at Purchase campus of SUNY, kept interest in meditation private.
- Conducted seminal work in affective neuroscience.
- Dan could not find a university post reflecting his interests and became a science writer instead.

**Impact:**
- Dan wrote articles on emotions and the brain for the New York Times based on Richie's research and others'.
- Wrote "Emotional Intelligence".
- Both continued to practice meditation privately despite not publicly pursuing it through their research.

### ALTERED STATES

**William James and Altered States of Consciousness**

- William James: first professor of psychology at Harvard, invented the field from philosophy to empirical approach
- James's former home near Harvard, but not assigned in graduate courses
- Inspired students with his exploration of consciousness
- Experienced altered states through nitrous oxide and wrote about discontinuous forms of consciousness
- **Altered States:** disconnected from ordinary consciousness, often ignored in psychology
- In James's time: fascination with nitrous oxide, diagnosed as psychopathology or regression
- By 1960s: dismissed as artificially induced psychosis, stigmatized in academia

**Background on Altered States of Consciousness**

- Transcendental experiences not part of psychology's topography (map)
- Lack of interest and skepticism towards altered states
- Early rejections: Freud diagnosed Romain Rolland as regressing to infancy, psychologists dismissed drug-triggered altered states as psychosis

**1970s Shift in Perspective**

- Interest in consciousness during the 1970s
- Charles Tart's Altered States of Consciousness: collection of articles on various methods to achieve altered states
- Excitement around neurotransmitters and their role in altering moods and experiences
- Neurotransmitter discoveries filtered into popular culture, leading to interest in achieving altered states through drugs like LSD (psychedelic revolution)
- Stalwarts in academia took a dim view of this line of research due to its ties to altered states.

### AN INNER JOURNEY

**An Inner Journey: Richie's Experience at Dalhousie Meditation Retreat**

* **Dalhousie:** Hill station located in the lower reaches of the Dhauladhar range, India. Established as a getaway for British Raj bureaucrats.
* **Richie and Susan's Visit:** Came to Dalhousie for a 10-day meditation retreat with S.N. Goenka. Encouraged by Dan's experience in Bodh Gaya.
* **Retreat Experience:**
  - Living arrangements: Men and women in separate tents.
  - Noble silence from day one.
  - Twelve hours of sitting meditation daily.
  - Painful physical sensations: Knees, back.
  - Instruction to "sweep" through bodily sensations.
  - Equanimity and well-being experienced.
* **Highs and Low:**
  - Deep conviction in transformative methods.
  - Feeling of being in control of mind.
  - Post-retreat: High continued on the bus, waned during travel and illness.
  - Loss of high felt like a psychedelic trip.
* **Reflections and Questions:**
  - How long do meditation-induced states last?
  - What makes a transformation enduring?
  - Where in the mind did Richie reach during his retreat?

### A MEDITATOR’S GUIDEBOOK

**A Meditator's Guidebook:**

* **Visuddhimagga**: A fifth-century Pali text that serves as a definitive guide for meditators following the Theravada tradition, providing a detailed phenomenology of meditative states and their progression towards nirvana.
* **Meditative States and Progression:**
  * **Path of Concentration**: Focus on breath or other points of focus to settle the mind; initial stages involve a wobbly dance between full focus and wandering thoughts, which subside as concentration strengthens.
  * **Access Concentration**: Sustained focus where attention stays fixed without wandering off; brings feelings of delight and calm, along with sensory phenomena.
  * **Jhana (Samadhi)**: Deep absorption in meditation, characterized by strong rapture, bliss, and one-pointed focus on the meditation target. The Visuddhimagga lists seven levels of jhana with increasing subtlety.
* **Insight Meditation versus Concentration:**
  * **Buddha's Discovery**: Abandoned the pursuit of full concentrated absorption in samadhi and instead focused on looking deeply into the mechanics of consciousness, leading to the path of insight.
  * **Enduring Change vs. Transitory States**: Beyond transitory states like jhanas lies the potential for lasting changes in one's being, such as the fading away of negative emotions and the emergence of positive qualities.
* **Meditation Highs and Realization:**
  * **Meditation High vs. Enduring Change**: A meditation high (like access concentration or first jhana) is temporary, while enduring change involves lasting transformations in one's being.
  * **The Yogi's Tale**: Illustrates the difference between transitory states and enduring change; the yogi's anger despite reaching high levels of samadhi shows that true realization goes beyond fleeting experiences.
* **Buddha's Challenge to Traditional Yogic Practices:**
  * **Insight vs. Concentration**: The Buddha's discovery of insight meditation was a challenge to traditional yogic practices, which focused on the path of concentration leading to various levels of samadhi.
* **Modern Perspective: Psychedelics and Meditation:**
  * **Misconceptions of Drug-Induced States**: The assumption that drug-induced altered states can replace years of meditation practice is incorrect, as drug effects are transient and do not lead to lasting changes in one's being.

**While meditation highs can offer valuable insights, they do not guarantee enduring change; true realization requires consistent effort and sustained awareness through the path of insight.**

## Chapter 3: The After Is the Before for the Next During

**The After Is the Before for the Next During**

**Dan's second stay in Asia (1973)**
- Social Science Research Council postdoc in ethnopsychology
- Six months in Kandy, Sri Lanka, studying under Nyanaponika Thera
- Abhidhamma: a psychological system outlining mind elements and methods for transformation

**Studies with Nyanaponika Thera (Kandy)**
- Focused on the Abhidhamma, a map of mind and its key elements
- Healthy vs. unhealthy mental states
- Relevance to psychology: dynamic between healthy and unhealthy states
- Buoyancy, flexibility, adaptability as healthy traits applicable to both mind and body

**The relevance of healthy and unhealthy states**
- Unhealthy states: desires, self-centeredness, sluggishness, agitation
- Healthy states: even-mindedness, composure, ongoing mindfulness, realistic confidence
- Inhibition of unhealthy states by healthy ones, and vice versa

**Implications for practice**
- Suppression of unhealthy states during deep concentration
- Transformation through insight practice
- Advanced practitioner embodies healthy traits (confidence, buoyancy)

**Return to America**
- Hired at Harvard as a visiting lecturer
- Offered The Psychology of Consciousness course in fall 1974
- Enrollment: hundreds of students; move to Sanders Theatre
- Richie, teaching assistant

**Publication and early work on altered traits (The Role of Attention in Meditation and Hypnosis)**
- Transformations of consciousness as altered traits
- Differentiation between meditation and hypnosis in terms of effects
- Focus on lasting changes vs. temporary states
- Early articulation of "the after is the before for the next during" hypothesis

**Challenges and limitations**
- Lack of scientific evidence
- Outlier status in psychology
- Risky business due to bold vision

**Later discoveries and confirmation of the altered traits hypothesis**
- Long-term meditation research revealing changes in brain structure and function (chapter twelve)

### THE SCIENCE CATCHES UP

**Science and Innovation:**
- The process of scientific discovery starts with novel ideas that undergo empirical testing to eliminate bad hypotheses and spread good ones. (Schumpeter's "creative destruction")
- Balance between skeptics and speculators is essential for scientific progress.
- Intuition ("vision") supplies direction and energy for analytic efforts, leading to new insights.

**Brain Science and Altered Traits:**
- Early research in the 1970s lacked data and methods to support the idea that practicing meditation leads to lasting influences beyond the session itself.
- The evolution of brain science over decades provided mounting rationales for this idea.

**Impact of Experience on the Brain:**
- **Bruce McEwen's Study (1980s):** Shrinking dendrites in rodents exposed to prolonged stress indicated faulty memory and opened minds to the possibility that experiences leave neural scars.
- **Marion Diamond's Studies:** Stimulating environments led to thicker dendritic branches and growth in brain areas crucial for attention and self-regulation.

**Challenging Conventional Wisdom:**
- McEwen and Diamond's research challenged the pervasive belief that we host a maximum number of neurons at birth and lose them inexorably over life, with experience having no role.

**Implications for Meditation:**
- The possibility of meditation as a beneficial inner workout emerged from these findings, although it took several more decades for evidence to catch up.

### THE BIG LEAP

**The Big Leap: Reconciling Nature and Nurture through Neuroplasticity**
- Year 1992: Sociology department at University of Wisconsin asked Richie to deliver a major colloquium
- Long-standing debate between "nature" and "nurture" camps in social sciences
- Nature camp believed behavior was determined by genes, nurture camp focused on experiences
- Intellectual cyclone with a history of misuse by racists for bias
- Backlash against biological explanations led to skepticism among sociologists

**Richie's Perspective:**
- Committed scientific fallacy to immediately assume biological causes reduced group differences to genetics and made them unchangeable
- Proposed the concept of "neuroplasticity"

**Neuroplasticity:**
- Concept showing repeated experience can change the brain, shaping it
- Nature and nurture interact, each molding the other
- Reconciled hostile points of view

**Challenges and Progress:**
- Proposed concept was beyond the science of the day with hazy data on human neuroplasticity
- Few years later, cascade of scientific findings supported neuroplasticity:
  - Mastering a musical instrument enlarged relevant brain centers
  - Violinists had larger areas in their brains managing finger work based on length of play

### NATURE’S EXPERIMENT

**Nature's Experiment and Neuroplasticity:**

- Looking straight ahead, moving a finger to the periphery demonstrates the limitation of our visual system, which most people can't follow.
- Deaf individuals have an advantage in perceiving objects in their peripheral vision.
- This visual advantage is due to neuroplasticity, as shown through brain studies and MRI scans.

**Deaf Individuals and Peripheral Vision:**

- Deaf people naturally exercise their ability to perceive in the outer rim of their vision while interpreting sign language.
- Sign language gestures often move outside the central vision area.
- Brain plasticity allows deaf individuals' brains to adapt, using the primary auditory cortex (Heschl's gyrus) for visual tasks instead.

**Neuroplasticity:**

- Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to rewire itself in response to repeated experiences.
- The findings from deaf individuals and musicians illustrate the extent of neuroplasticity.
- Neuroplasticity offers a scientific framework for understanding how intentional training, such as meditation, affects the brain.

### THE ALTERED TRAIT SPECTRUM

**Altered Trait Spectrum:**
- Altered traits map along a spectrum starting at the negative end with PTSD
- **Amygdala:** neural radar for threat, reset to hair trigger in PTSD leading to overreactions and symptoms
- Moving towards positive range, beneficial impacts of secure childhood and nurturing parenting
- Interests lies in altered traits in highly positive range, i.e., equanimity and compassion
- **Neuroplasticity:** scientific basis for creating lasting qualities through repeated training

**Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):**
- Negative altered trait on the spectrum
- Amygdala's threshold for responding to trauma is reset to hair trigger
- Cues associated with traumatic experience cause cascade of neural overreactions, leading to flashbacks, sleeplessness, irritability, and hypervigilance

**Secure Childhood:**
- Positive altered trait on the spectrum
- Brain shaped by empathic, concerned, and nurturing parenting
- Builds into adulthood abilities like calming down when upset

**Altered Traits:**
- Highly positive range of altered traits, including equanimity and compassion
- Goal of mind training in contemplative traditions
- Lasting qualities created through neuroplasticity and repeated training

**Neuroplasticity:**
- Scientific basis for creating altered traits through training

**Mind Training:**
- Ancient practices aimed at creating altered traits, i.e., equanimity and compassion
- Described as lasting transformation at higher levels

**Flourishing:**
- Practical potential of altering traits towards a life best described as flourishing
- Achievable goal for everyone regardless of lofty heights of being.

### FLOURISHING

**Alexander the Great and Encounter with Gymnosophists (Naked Philosophers)**:
* Alexander met ascetic yogis, called gymnosophists, in Taxila, India.
* Greek-derived term for "naked philosophers" who roam naked and coat themselves in ashes.
* Impressed by their equanimity, Alexander deemed them "free men."
* One yogi, Kalyana, accompanied Alexander on his journey of conquest.

**Alexander's Greek Education**:
* Tutored by the Greek philosopher Aristotle.
* Renowned for his lifelong love of learning.
* Greek schools of philosophy espoused personal transformation.

**Aristotle's Ideas on Flourishing (Eudaimonia)**:
* Goal of life is virtue-based eudaimonia – a quality of flourishing.
* Virtues are attained by finding the right mean between extremes.
* Not naturally virtuous but have the potential to become so through effort.
* Involves self-monitoring and noting thoughts and acts.

**Greco-Roman Philosophic Schools**:
* Stoics: Determining happiness lies in feelings about life's events, not events themselves.
* Serenity prayer echoes Stoic creed: Accept things you cannot change, courage to change things you can, wisdom to know the difference.
* Classical way to "wisdom to know the difference": Mental training.
* Greeks saw philosophy as an applied art, teaching contemplative exercises and self-discipline for flourishing.

**Shared Values in Western and Eastern Traditions**:
* Cultivating virtuous life via transformation of being.
* Greek practices for developing virtues: Integrity, kindness, patience, humility, etc.
* In Buddhism, ideal of inner flourishing is put in terms of bodhi – self-actualization that nourishes the best within oneself.

### ARISTOTLE’S DESCENDANTS

**Aristotle's Legacy in Modern Psychology:**
* Today's psychology uses the term ""well-being"" for a modern interpretation of Aristotle's concept of eudaimonia or flourishing.
* Carol Ryff, a University of Wisconsin psychologist, posited a model of well-being with six components based on Aristotle and other thinkers:

**Self-Acceptance:**
* Positive self-regard
* Acknowledging one's best and not-so-good qualities
* Nonjudgmental self-awareness

**Personal Growth:**
* Continuous change and development towards potential
* Adopting new ways of seeing or being
* Making the most of talents

**Autonomy:**
* Independence in thought and deed
* Freedom from social pressure
* Using one's own standards to measure oneself

**Mastery:**
* Feeling competent to handle life's complexities
* Seizing opportunities
* Creating situations that suit needs and values

**Satisfying Relationships:**
* Warmth, empathy, trust
* Mutual concern for each other
* Healthy give-and-take

**Life Purpose:**
* Goals and beliefs giving a sense of meaning and direction
* Some philosophers argue true happiness comes from meaning and purpose

**Meditation's Impact on Well-being:**

* Several studies suggest meditation boosts people's ratings on Ryff's measure of well-being.
* Meditation may strengthen a sense of purpose in life, leading to increased telomerase activity in immune cells (protecting the length of telomeres and cell life).
* Some studies indicate mindfulness practices can enlarge a brain region associated with well-being.
* Practicing everyday mindfulness can boost subjective well-being.
* Research on meditation's impact on well-being is not always rigorous, and larger studies and brain measures are necessary for more conclusive evidence.

*Meditation research varies in scientific soundness; it's essential to use rigorous standards when evaluating claims about meditation's benefits.*

## Chapter 4: The Best We Had

**The Best We Had:** 
* Scene: A woodworking shop where Al and Frank are happily chatting while Al operates a circular saw without its safety guard, putting his thumb in danger.
* Dan, a researcher, observes the scene and notices Al's unsafe behavior.
* The film also served as emotional stressors in Dan's research on meditation and stress response.

**Impact of the Film:**
* Dan used the film to study the effects of meditation on stress response.
* He showed the film to two groups: meditation teachers (experienced meditators) and Harvard students with no meditation experience.
* Half of each group meditated before watching the film, while the other half just relaxed.
* Experienced meditators tended to recover from the stress of seeing the upsetting events more quickly than novices.

**Issues and Problems:**
* Dan's research has flaws:
  + He was the person who taught the volunteers to meditate or told them to relax, potentially influencing their results.
  + No attempts were made to replicate the study to see if similar outcomes would be found.
  + The field of psychology favors original work over replication, and scientists rarely publish studies with no significant findings.
* Replicability is essential for trustworthy research results.
* Psychological studies rely on both "soft" (self-reported) and "hard" measures (physiological responses).
  + Soft measures are susceptible to biases like expectation demand, while hard measures like heart rate or brain activity are more accurate.
* Dan's study relied on self-reported anxiety assessments and physiological measures like heart rate and sweat response.
* The recording technology used in the study was less precise than current methods, making data analysis challenging.

**Potential Problems with Dan's Research:**
* Experimenter bias: Dan scored the data and analyzed it to support his hypothesis, potentially skewing the results.
* Dan's recollection after nearly fifty years is that he may have favored meditators in his scoring, making their sweat response seem to react more to the accidents while recovering more quickly.
* Researchers' own meditation practice might influence their research bias, even if unconsciously.

### UNBIASING SCIENCE

**Unbiased Science and the Issue of Bias in Meditation Research**

* **The Godfather of Meditation: Yogi Z's Demand**
  + Dan attended a teacher training summer camp run by Yogi Z in 1971.
  + Yogi Z asked Dan to write a doctoral dissertation promoting his meditation method as the only way to become enlightened.
  + This request represents the hustle that can characterize some spiritual teachers and their research.

**Questions of Bias in Meditation Research**

* **Conflict of Interest: Maharishi University of Management**
  + Most TM research has been conducted by researchers affiliated with Maharishi University of Management.
  + Raises concerns about the objectivity and potential bias in TM research.

* **Importance of Skepticism and Active Controls**
  + Having skeptics in a lab raises questions and issues that might be overlooked by "true believers."
  + Employing active controls, such as an exercise group, can help minimize experimenter bias.

**Dilemmas in Meditation Research: Non-representative Samples**

* **The WEIRD Population: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic**
  + Harvard students used in research are a non-representative sample of humanity as a whole.
  + Using such a sample limits the generalizability of findings to universals in human nature.

### THE VARIETIES OF THE MEDITATIVE EXPERIENCE

**The Varieties of the Meditative Experience:**
* Richie's dissertation research focused on identifying a neural signature of attention skill in meditators and non-meditators.
* He investigated if meditators were better at focusing their attention using event-related potential (ERP) recordings from the brain.
* Meditators showed a stronger pattern of blocking out unwanted modalities compared to non-meditators.
* However, evidence was weak due to the recruitment of various meditation techniques and lack of specificity.

**Background:**
* Richie's PhD research was an exploration of attention skills in meditators and non-meditators.
* He used event-related potential (ERP) recordings from the brain to investigate focusing abilities.
* ERPs are tiny electrical signals measured in microvolts, revealing how we allocate our attention.

**Findings:**
* Meditators showed a stronger pattern of blocking out unwanted modalities compared to non-meditators.
* Different meditation practices can produce unique results, impacting mental skills in varying ways.
* Misunderstandings and confusion about specific meditation types remain common.

**Importance of Specificity:**
* Differing types of meditation train various mental habits.
* Failure to identify the specific type being studied may limit findings.
* Importance of matching a given mental strategy in meditation to its result.

**Examples of Different Meditation Practices:**
* Focusing on breathing: calming, but not necessarily relaxing.
* Generating loving-kindness: creates positive mood but demands mental effort.
* Monitoring thoughts: requires mental effort and doesn't make the body more relaxed.

**Antimeditation Methods:**
* Some researchers use antimeditation methods as controls, which can be confusing.
* Misunderstanding of what meditation is can lead to inaccurate research conclusions.

*The importance of identifying specific meditation types for research purposes cannot be overstated.*

### COUNTING THE HOURS

**Counting the Hours: The Importance of Tracking Meditation Practice Hours**
- Dan's meditators were "expert" Transcendental Meditation teachers with at least two years of practice, but the number of total hours and their quality was unknown.
- Researchers often lack this crucial data for calculating lifetime hours of practice and its impact on changes in traits and brain differences.

**Challenges in Collecting Data on Meditation Practice Hours**
- Meditators are often lumped into broad categories without specific details about their practice hours.
- Some studies report daily meditation time but not the number of months or years.
- Lack of precise data on total lifetime hours, retreats, and styles of meditation practice in many research studies.

**The Importance of Total Lifetime Hours in Meditation Research**
- Our model of change tracks lifetime hours of practice, connected to shifts in qualities of being and underlying brain differences.
- Calculating total hours allows for analysis in terms of different styles and retreat versus home hours.

**Dose-Response Relationship: The More You Practice, the Better the Payoff**
- There is often a relationship between the number of meditation hours and brain and behavioral benefits.
- Failing to report lifetime hours of practice for meditators in studies can result in important data being missed.

**Expert Meditators: Variation in Definitions and Practice Hours**
- Many studies include "expert" groups but do not use a precise metric or define their experience levels consistently.
- Calculating lifetime hours is essential to understanding the variation in expertise among meditators.

**Instructor Experience: A Factor to Consider**
- Some meditation research studies neglect to mention the meditation teachers' own practice hours and experience.
- This information can be critical for understanding the quality of instruction being provided to the study participants.

### BEYOND THE HAWTHORNE EFFECT

**Hawthorne Effect and Meditation Research:**
* Hawthorne Effect: any positive intervention or observation can lead to improved performance or self-reported better feelings, without any unique value-added factor from the intervention itself.
* Richie's lab focuses on using proper comparison conditions in meditation research.

**Dealing with Hawthorne Effect in Meditation Studies:**
* Developing an ""active control"" condition: Health Enhancement Program (HEP) consisting of music therapy, nutritional education, and movement exercises.
* Instructors taught HEP with the same level of positivity as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR).

**Study Findings:**
* Volunteers in both HEP and MBSR groups reported comparable improvement on subjective measures of general distress, anxiety, and medical symptoms.
* No difference found in the level of improvement from MBSR or HEP on a questionnaire specifically developed to measure mindfulness.

**Implications:**
* Many stress relief improvements beginners credit to meditation may not be unique.
* Reported benefits may be due to expectation, social bonding, instructor enthusiasm, or other ""demand characteristics.""
* Be wary of exaggerated claims about the benefits of meditation.
* A call for more rigorous designs in meditation research.

**Key Takeaways:**
* The Hawthorne Effect can influence meditation studies, leading to overestimation of the unique benefits of meditation.
* Proper comparison conditions and active controls are essential in meditation research.
* Many reported benefits may be due to factors other than meditation itself.

### WHAT EXACTLY IS “MINDFULNESS”?

**Definition of Mindfulness**
* Popular term for various meditation practices
* Originates from Pali word "sati"
* Translated as "awareness," "attention," "retention," or "discernment"
* Some traditions use it to describe noticing mind wandering and returning focus
* Others refer to a floating awareness without judgment or reaction
* Scientific understanding of mindfulness varies

**Mindfulness in Meditation**
* Focus on one thing and notice when mind wanders, then return focus
* Sequence includes mind wandering and bringing attention back (concentration)
* Mindfulness plays supporting role in concentration practices

**Different Meanings of Mindfulness**
* Zen or Theravadan context vs. Tibetan traditions
* Differing attentional stances and potential brain correlates
* Important for researchers to clarify specific type of mindfulness studied

**Measuring Mindfulness in Scientific Research**
* Commonly used measures not based on actual meditation practice
* Self-report questionnaires assess different facets of mindfulness
* Needs both construct and discriminant validity

**Construct Validity vs. Discriminant Validity**
* Construct validity: measure correlates with what it should (MBSR, mindfulness practice)
* Discriminant validity: measure does not correlate when it should not (HEP active control group)

**Issues with Self-Report Measures of Mindfulness**
* Lack of discriminant validity in commonly used measures
* Potential for overestimating mindfulness practice effects
* Importance of using more reliable and valid measurement methods.

**Mindfulness Measurement:**
- Self-report measures of mindfulness, such as questionnaires, can be susceptible to skews and psychological bias.
- A study showed a positive correlation between binge drinking and mindfulness, which is off-base.
- Davidson group developed a more robust behavioral measure: ability to maintain focus while counting breaths.
- Expert meditators perform better than nonmeditators on this test, and scores improve with training.

**Early Meditation Research:**
- First attempts at meditation research were flawed due to lack of rigor and precision in measuring meditation impacts.
- Use of active control groups and more sophisticated methods have improved over the years.
- A large proportion of meditation studies fail to meet gold standards for publication in top scientific journals.

**Meditation Research Findings:**
- Results of meditation research can be confusing due to a vast number of studies with varying findings.
- Trait changes from meditation research are categorized along the lines of classic literature on spiritual traditions.
- Four main neural pathways transformed by meditation: stress reactivity, compassion and empathy, attention, and self-sense.

**Methodology:**
- Research group gathers exhaustive collection of studies on a given topic and selects those that meet highest standards of experimental design.
- Only a small number of studies make it through rigorous scrutiny for inclusion in the account.
- Appreciation to other research efforts whose findings agree, disagree, or add a twist to the account.

**Main Findings:**
- Meditation leads to improvements in stress reactivity and recovery (first neural pathway).
- Enhances compassion and empathy (second neural pathway).
- Improves attention (third neural pathway).
- Alters sense of self (fourth neural pathway).
- Benefits include having a healthy body and mind.

## Chapter 5: A Mind Undisturbed

**A Mind Undisturbed:**
- Goal in meditation paths across spiritual traditions (Thomas Merton, sixth-century Christian monk)
- Free and without concern (Merton's poem inspired by Taoism)

**Opposite of a Mind Undisturbed:**
- Angst, worries, and stressors in modern life
- Psychological and ongoing, unlike temporary biological stressors in nature
- Triggers ancient biological reactions when prolonged

**Impact of Prolonged Stress:**
- Vulnerability to stress-worsened diseases (diabetes, hypertension)
- Upside: human cortex built civilizations and technology
- Downside: ability to anticipate future and worry, think about past and regret

**Impact of Chronic Worry:**
- Greek philosopher Epictetus: upsetting not things but our view of them
- Modern sentiment: not big things that drive us mad, but "the shoelace that snaps with no time left" (Charles Bukowski)
- Science shows: higher levels of stress hormones (cortisol) when we perceive hassles in life

**Possible Solution: Meditation**
- Can meditation help reduce stress and maintain a mind undisturbed?
- Remains an open question in scientific research, but evidence suggests potential benefits.

### FROM THE BACK OF AN ENVELOPE

**Jon Kabat-Zinn's Background and Early Meditation Experiences**

* PhD in molecular biology from MIT
* Studied meditation and yoga under Korean Zen master Seung Sahn
* Taught first meditation and yoga class to Richie in Cambridge, MA
* Received fellowship in anatomy and cell biology at UMass Medical School in Worcester
* Attended vipassana retreat led by Robert Hover in the Berkshires

**Insights from Vipassana Retreat**

* Focus on breath for concentration building
* Systematically scan body's sensations from head to toe
* Immobile meditation sessions produce intense pain but lead to perception shift
* Insight: share benefits of meditation practices with medical patients, especially those in pain

**Development of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)**

* Vision of helping chronic pain patients at Worcester pain clinics
* Adapted lying-down body scan meditation from yoga training
* Added sitting meditation, mindful walking, mindful eating, and general awareness
* Incorporated elements from Zen and vipassana traditions
* First MBSR program began in September 1979 at UMass Medical Center

**Benefits of MBSR**

* Boosts stress management skills
* Reduces amygdala activity and strengthens attentional networks (study by Goldin and Gross)
* Widely practiced in hospitals, clinics, schools, and businesses

### MINDFUL ATTENTION

**Mindful Attention Training (MAT)**
- Developed by Alan Wallace, based on Tibetan meditation practices
- Focuses on full focus on breath, then observing mind stream, and finally resting in awareness
- Study at Emory compared MAT to compassion meditation and active control group

**Findings of Emory Study:**
- Participants who practiced MAT showed reduced amygdala activity in response to disturbing images
- Changes occurred in ordinary baseline state, suggesting trait effect

**Amygdala:**
- Brain's radar for threat
- Receives immediate input from senses and scans for safety or danger
- Triggers brain's freeze-fight-or-flight response when perceives threat
- Plays a role in focusing attention and intense emotional reactions

**Effects of Mindfulness on Amygdala:**
- Studies show mindfulness calms amygdala, reducing reactivity
- First study showed reduced amygdala activity during MAT in ordinary awareness (trait effect)
- Second study showed reduced amygdala response only during mindful attention (state effect)

**Implications:**
- Mindfulness practice can help reduce anxiety and distractibility by calming the amygdala
- Amygdala's role as brain's radar for threat explains why we focus on sources of anxiety
- Direct measurement of amygdala activity using brain scanners provides more accurate results than indirect measures like sweat response.

### PAIN IS IN THE BRAIN

**Pain is in the Brain:**

* The brain processes pain sensations and our emotional response to them
* Mindfulness practice can transform painful sensations into subtler experiences
* Meditation may mute emotional response to pain, making it more bearable

**Meditation and Pain Threshold:**

* Meditation practitioners have higher pain thresholds than non-practitioners
* Small difference in temperature can have dramatic impact on pain experience
* Trait effect of meditation practice as an alternative explanation for the difference

**Burnout vs. Meditation:**

* Burnout is a depleted, hopeless state caused by constant stress
* Brain scans reveal enlarged amygdalae and weak connections in prefrontal cortex
* Victims of burnout unable to down-regulate emotional response to stressors
* Indirect evidence suggests meditation enhances resilience and recovery from stress

**Meditation and Pain Research:**

* Medoc thermal stimulator used to assess conditions like neuropathy and study meditation's effect on pain perception
* Experienced Zen meditators show functional decoupling of higher and lower brain regions during pain, responding to it as a more neutral sensation
* No-appraisal neural strategy applied in meditation practice offers an alternative explanation for reducing subjective severity and brain response to pain

**Meditation and Well-being:**

* Having a sense of purpose and meaning may help people meet life's challenges better, enhancing well-being
* Meditation seems to enhance well-being on Ryff's measure, which includes a person's sense of purpose
* Direct evidence suggests meditation can help people respond more effectively to upsets and challenges.

### BEYOND CORRELATION

**Psychology of Consciousness Course at Harvard (1975)**
- Dan taught course with Richie as teaching assistant
- Cliff Saron, a graduate student at Harvard, met with weekly students
- Cliff had knack for technical end of research and electronics
- Coauthored scientific papers with Richie
- Joined Richie at State University of New York at Purchase to manage lab
- Received PhD in neuroscience from Albert Einstein College of Medicine
- Directs lab at Center for Mind and Brain, UC Davis
- Faculty member at Mind and Life Summer Research Institute

**Meditation Research**
- Conducted longitudinal study on meditation with Alan Wallace as retreat leader
- Students underwent a three-month training in various classic meditation styles
- Assessments given at beginning, middle, end of retreat, and five months after
- Control group consisted of people who signed up for the retreat but did not start until first group finished
- Comparison group took same assessments at identical context

**Attention Training During Meditation**
- Participants showed improvement in inhibiting knee-jerk tendency to press button for short lines as retreat progressed
- Skill critical for managing emotions and impulses
- Statistical analysis suggested improvements in self-reported anxiety, overall well-being, and emotion regulation
- Wait-list controls showed no change but same improvements after retreat
- Follow-up five months after retreats ended found improvements remained

**Benefits of Meditation**
- Altered traits directly linked to meditation practice
- Dispels doubts that all positive traits in long-term meditators due to self-selection
- States practiced in meditation spill over into daily life, especially for handling stress

### A DEVILISH ORDEAL

**Trier Social Stress Test (TSST)** and its Impact on the Brain:
* A psychological test used to trigger stress circuits and hormones by simulating a job interview followed by rapid-fire mental arithmetic.
* Delivers social stress, causing feelings of evaluation, rejection, or exclusion.

**Impact of TSST on Blood Pressure:**
* Alan Wallace and Paul Ekman's renewal program for schoolteachers combined psychological training with meditation.
* Teachers who practiced meditation had quicker blood pressure recovery from high points during the Trier test, suggesting a mild trait effect.

**Impact of Meditation on Cortisol Levels:**
* Seasoned vipassana meditators showed a smaller rise in cortisol during the stress test.
* Perceived the stressor as less stressful, indicating a cooled-out way of viewing it.

**Neuroscientific Findings on Meditation and Emotional Reactivity:**
1. **Amygdala Reactivity:**
   * Seasoned meditators had lowered amygdala reactivity when exposed to disturbing images, implying emotional resilience.
   * MBSR training also reduced amygdala reactivity but did not strengthen the prefrontal cortex-amygdala connection.
2. **Prefrontal Cortex and Amygdala Connectivity:**
   * Stronger connectivity between these brain regions indicates less emotional hijacking and greater emotional resilience.
   * Long-term meditators showed this enhanced connectivity, while MBSR participants did not.

**Implications for Stress Management and Trait Development:**
* Long-term meditation practice may lead to improved emotional regulation and increased functional connectivity between prefrontal areas and the amygdala.
* Enhanced connectivity can result in less emotional reactivity, allowing individuals to manage distress more effectively during challenging situations.
* The ability to regulate attention is also associated with some beneficial impact of meditation on stress reactivity.
* Continued practice is essential for transforming state effects into trait effects and maintaining resilience.

## Chapter 6: Primed for Love

**Ancient Desert Hermits and Compassion**
- Ancient desert hermits, known as Desert Fathers, shared an ethic of selflessness and generosity
- Compassion and loving-kindness were key drivers of their community
- A story illustrates the passing of grapes in the desert commune out of compassion

**The Story of the Grapes**
- Grapes brought to Macarius, a hermit
- Instead of keeping them, Macarius gave them to another hermit
- This process continued until the grapes returned to Macarius
- Compassion and putting others' needs before own drove the journey of the grapes

**Modern Application: The Good Samaritan Parable and Divinity Students**
- Divinity students were evaluated on a practice sermon
- Half received random Bible topics, while half were assigned the Good Samaritan parable
- Students passing through a courtyard on way to give sermon were asked if they stopped to help a stranger in pain
- Results showed that time pressure decreased likelihood of stopping to help

**The Importance of Compassion and Helping Others**
- Holding the attitude of compassion vs. embodying compassion
- Several meditation methods aim to cultivate compassion
- Scientific question: Does cultivating compassion lead to compassionate action?

### MAY ALL BEINGS BE FREE FROM SUFFERING

**May all beings be free from suffering:**
* Dan lectured at a conference on yoga and science in New Delhi, December 1970.
* Sharon Salzberg, an eighteen-year-old from State University of New York at Buffalo, attended the lecture.
* She had traveled from Europe to India with thousands of young Westerners in the 1970s.
* Dan mentioned a vipassana course by S. N. Goenka in Bodh Gaya and ongoing series of ten-day retreats.
* Sharon joined the retreat, became an ardent student, and later co-founded Insight Meditation Society (IMS) with Joseph Goldstein.
* She is a leading advocate for "loving-kindness" or metta meditation.

**Loving-Kindness Meditation:**
* First learned from Goenka in Bodh Gaya.
* Involves unconditional benevolence and goodwill, similar to Greek agape.
* Western version includes phrases like "May I be safe," "May I be healthy," and "May my life unfold with ease."
* Wished for self, then loved ones, neutral people, and finally all beings.
* Most well-studied format of compassion meditation.
* Sometimes includes wishing people to be free from suffering.

**Compassion vs. Self-Compassion:**
* Sharon discussed self-loathing among Westerners during a 1989 dialogue with the Dalai Lama.
* The Dalai Lama was surprised as he'd assumed people naturally loved themselves.
* In Tibetan, Pali, and Sanskrit, compassion implies feeling for oneself as well as others.
* English lacked a term for self-compassion until Kristin Neff's research in the late 1990s.

**Self-Compassion:**
* Includes being kind to oneself instead of self-critical.
* Viewing failures and mistakes as part of human condition, not personal failing.
* Not ruminating about imperfections but just noting them.
* Opposite of self-compassion is constant self-criticism, common in depressed thinking.

**Research:**
* Israeli group tested the effect of loving-kindness meditation on self-critical individuals.
* Findings: Lessened harsh thoughts and increased self-compassion.
* Loving-kindness directed to oneself may offer a direct antidote to self-criticism.

### EMPATHY MEANS FEELING WITH

**Empathy:** feeling with someone; translated from German word Einfühlung
**Three Kinds of Empathy:**
- **Cognitive empathy:** understanding how someone thinks, seeing their perspective
- **Emotional empathy:** feeling what the other person is feeling
- **Empathic concern or caring:** defining sign of compassion

**Brain Research on Empathy:**
- Three types activate different brain circuits
- Cognitive empathy: understanding but no sympathetic feelings
- Emotional empathy: feeling in your own body what the suffering person feels
- **Empathetic concern:** activates parental love circuits, allowing positive response to suffering

**History of Empathy:**
- Entered English language early 20th century as a translation of Einfühlung
- Lacking empathic concern can lead to averting gaze from suffering, preventing compassionate action

**Effects of Media on Empathy:**
- Brain studies show negative emotional echo with graphic videos of suffering
- Empathy activates insula circuits associated with our own suffering
- Compassionate response (loving-kindness meditation) activates different circuits, allowing positive response to suffering

**Benefits of Compassion:**
- Acceptance of suffering leads to taking helpful action
- Compassion allows us to confront and deal with difficulty
- Cultivating compassion through meditation can change brain responses to suffering.

**Role of Compassion in Eastern Culture:**
- Kuan Yin: revered symbol of compassionate awakening, translates to "the one who listens and hears the cries of the world in order to come and help."

### FROM ATTITUDE TO ACTION

**From Attitude to Action:**
- Skepticism about neural patterns leading to actual helping behavior
- Neural priming for kindness and action not convincing on its own
- Seminary students reflecting on Good Samaritan story did not help in real life

**Evidence for Hopeful Outcome:**
- Compassion training vs. cognitive reappraisal studies
  * Brain scans before and after 2-week interventions
  * Compassion training: thinking of others
  * Cognitive reappraisal: self-focus, changing negative thoughts
- Redistribution Game experiments
  * Volunteers witnessed unfair treatment of a victim
  * Given opportunity to donate own money to victim
  * Game rules forced dictator to give more than volunteers

**Results:**
- Compassion training group gave almost twice as much money to victim
- Increased activation in attention, perspective taking, and positive feelings
- More activation = more altruistic behavior

### READY TO LOVE

**Neural Profile of Reactions to Suffering:**

* **Loving-kindness practice:** stimulates feelings of good feelings and social connection, even temporarily
* **Brain changes:** long-term loving-kindness practitioners show strong echoes of brain patterns found in more experienced meditators
* **Neural responses to suffering:**
  * **Distress circuitry:** insula and amygdala respond strongly when empathizing with others' pain
  * **Amygdala:** signals salient environments, amplifies empathy to suffering during compassion meditation
  * **Insula:** monitors body signals, activates autonomic responses during empathy
* **Short-term vs. long-term meditation:** meditation comes in batches; different practices change brain in various ways
  + Compassion practice: amygdala is turned up, readying the body for engagement
  + Focused attention: amygdala is turned down, promoting concentration
* **Long-term effects of mental training:**
  * Saron's study: those who sustained attention to suffering images had better memory and resistance to emotional hijack seven years later
  * Cultivating compassion may take advantage of biological preparedness for learning
* **Brain changes from loving-kindness practice:** align with those found in super-Samaritan kidney donors
* **Benefits of compassion meditation:**
  + Enhances happiness and joy
  + Strengthens connections between brain's circuits for joy, happiness, and prefrontal cortex
  + Increases altruistic behavior following compassion meditation training.

### NURTURING COMPASSION

**Nurturing Compassion** 

**Tania Singer's Journey:**
- Early interest in theater and meditation
- Studied various meditation practices, including vipassana and gratitude
- Drawing towards teachers embodying unconditional love
- Pursued psychology degree, research on learning in old age led to plasticity research
- Discovery of empathy neural connections with Matthieu Ricard

**Empathy vs. Compassion:**
- Empathy: Activates neural networks for pain and suffering, triggers an alarm response
- Compassion: Involves different brain circuits, those for warmth, love, concern, positive feelings, reward, and affiliation

**Experiments with Matthieu Ricard:**
- Cultivated empathy in the brain scanner: Activated neural networks for pain
- Generated compassion: Activated brain circuitry for positive feelings, reward, and affiliation

**Compassion Training:**
- Muted empathic distress, preventing emotional exhaustion and burnout
- Reverse engineered findings with meditation first-timers
- Increased neural activation of loving concern and positive feelings

**The ReSource Project:**
- Recruited 300 volunteers for three modules of training: Presence, Perspective, Affect
- Module 1 - "Presence": Body scan and breath focus, increased body awareness, lessened mind-wandering
- Module 2 - "Perspective": Contemplative dyads, enhanced meta-awareness (by-product of mindfulness)
- Module 3 - "Affect": Loving-kindness practice, boosted warm thoughts and feelings about others
- Control group: No training but took the same battery of tests every three months

**Findings:**
- Presence module: Increased body awareness, lessened mind-wandering
- Perspective module: Enhanced meta-awareness
- Affect module: Boosted warm thoughts and feelings about others (most effective way to increase kindness)

### WHAT’S THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT?

**Compassion Meditation and Donations:**
- University of Colorado study on compassion meditation and donations to people in need
- Compassion meditation vs placebo oxytocin: no significant difference in donation rates
- Those who did compassion meditation felt more tenderness towards people in need

**Key Points from the Study:**
- Methods were first-rate, but unclear nature of compassion meditation and potential changes over course of study
- Equanimity may have different effect on donations than compassion
- More research needed to understand inner forces that influence compassionate acts

**Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT):**
- Developed by Geshe Lobsang Tenzin Negi, combines loving-kindness meditation and determination to act accordingly
- CBCT group showed increased activity in right amygdala in response to suffering people's images
- Compassion group reported being happier overall during study

**Gender Differences in Compassion:**
- Women show higher levels of right amygdala reactivity than men in response to emotional images, including suffering
- Women may be more responsive to other people's emotions but less likely to act on that response

**Factors Affecting Compassionate Action:**
- Feelings of pressure for time, identification with the person in need, presence of a crowd or being alone can influence compassionate action.
- Open question: Does cultivating a compassionate outlook prime a person sufficiently to overcome these other forces in the face of someone's need?

### WIDENING OUR CIRCLE OF CARING

**Widening Our Circle of Caring:**

- One hour of loving-kindness meditation towards a difficult person equals one hundred hours towards a friend or loved one.
- **Loving-kindness meditation:** involves extending compassion to an ever-widening circle, including people we don't know and those we find difficult.
- **Recognizing oneness:** The Dalai Lama suggests recognizing the shared human desire for happiness as a strategy to extend compassion universally.
- **Implicit bias test:** Measures unconscious prejudice towards certain groups; research shows loving-kindness meditation reduces it.

**The Journey of Compassion:**

- **Building universal love:** Extending compassion beyond immediate loved ones is a significant challenge, but essential for healing conflicts and divides.
- **The Dalai Lama's experience:** Over his career, the Dalai Lama has worked to develop compassion for all beings, despite initial doubts about its attainability.
- **Benefits of compassion:** Compassion not only helps others but also increases our own happiness and wellbeing.

**The Power of Loving-kindness Meditation:**

- **Three forms of empathy:** Cognitive, emotional, and empathic concern.
- **Empathic concern enhancement:** Loving-kindness meditation enhances empathic concern, preparing us to act when we encounter suffering.
- **Brain changes:** Compassion and loving-kindness meditation increase amygdala activation to suffering, lessen activity on neutral stimuli, and strengthen brain circuits for happiness.
- **Quick results:** Benefits can be seen in as little as eight hours of practice, with reductions in unconscious bias emerging after sixteen hours.
- **Biological preparedness:** The early effects of meditation may indicate our innate biological readiness for compassionate behavior.

## Chapter 7: Attention!

**Zen Master and Attention**

* A student asked Zen master for a calligraphy of great wisdom, and the master wrote "Attention."
* The student was disappointed, so the master repeated it several times.
* William James later emphasized the importance of attention in his book "Principles of Psychology" (1890).
* Richie was inspired by this idea and saw meditation as an excellent education to improve attention.

**Importance of Attention**

* Attention is crucial for judgment, character, and will.
* Improving the faculty of bringing back wandering attention is the ideal education (James).
* Meditation practices entail retraining attention.

**Historical Background of Research on Attention**

* Little research on attention during Richie's graduate school days in the 1970s.
* Early studies focused on habituation and sensitization, involving the reticular activating system (RAS).
* Habituation: brain tunes out familiar stimuli to conserve energy.
* Sensitization: cortical circuits activate RAS for novel or surprising stimuli.

**Impact of Meditation on Attention**

* Japanese researchers studied monks' brain activity during meditation and found less habituation in advanced meditators.
* Mindfulness practices involve focusing attention on details and can reverse habituation, making the familiar fresh.

**Volitional Control of Attention**

* Early scientific view saw attention as mostly stimulus-driven, automatic, and unconscious (bottom-up).
* Volitional control of attention was not recognized until later discoveries about the prefrontal cortex.

**Prefrontal Cortex and Attention**

* Affective neuroscience studies midbrain's emotional circuitry and how emotions push/pull attention (1980s).
* Contemplative neuroscience research explores the brain during meditation, focusing on prefrontal cortex.
* Prefrontal cortex manages voluntary attention and holds the seeds of awakening to enduring well-being.

**Types of Attention**

* Selective attention: focus on one element and ignore others.
* Vigilance: maintaining constant attention over time.
* Allocating attention: noticing small or rapid shifts in experience.
* Goal focus: keeping a specific goal or task in mind despite distractions.
* Meta-awareness: tracking the quality of one's own awareness.

### SELECTING ATTENTION

**Amishi Jha: Born into a family that practiced meditation regularly**
- Became a cognitive neuroscientist specializing in attention
- Enccountered Richie Davidson, who sparked her interest in meditation's potential benefits for attention

**The Cocktail Party Effect and the Multichannel Nature of Attention:**
- Amount of information taken in is greater than conscious awareness
- Selective attention involves both consciously chosen channels and unconsciously tuned-out channels

**Early Research on Meditation and Attention (Richie's Dissertation):**
- Volunteers asked to pay attention to visual or tactile stimuli while ignoring the other
- Meditators showed a modest increase in cortical specificity, indicating improved focus

**Modern Studies on Meditation, Attention, and Brain Training:**
- More sophisticated measures of sensory awareness using MEG and MBSR training
- Participants who underwent 8-weeks of MBSR showed better focus and ability to ignore distractions compared to controls
- Vipassana meditators at a retreat displayed markedly improved selective attention after a three-month retreat.

**Arguments**:
- Meditation (specifically mindfulness meditation) can strengthen the brain's ability to focus on one thing and ignore distractions
- The neural circuitry for selective attention is trainable, contrary to previous assumptions.

### SUSTAINING ATTENTION

**Zen Scholar D. T. Suzuki and Sustained Attention**

* Suzuki appeared zoned out during a symposium but quickly reacted to a gust of wind blowing papers
* Zen meditation involves sustaining attention without habituating
* Attention is limited and allotted parsimoniously, with focus inevitably wandering
* Goal of meditation: sustaining attention on a chosen target (e.g., breath)

**Scientific Research on Meditation and Sustained Attention**

* Early findings showed Zen study spurred research on meditation's impact on sustained attention
* Numerous reports support meditation enhancing sustained attention or vigilance
* Control groups needed to establish causal link between meditation and sustained attention
* Longitudinal studies, such as Clifford Saron and Alan Wallace's three-month meditation retreat, provide stronger evidence

**Saron and Wallace's Study: Three-Month Meditation Retreat**

* Volunteers practiced five hours of focusing on breath daily with Wallace as teacher
* Pre-retreat, mid-retreat, post-retreat, and follow-up tests of vigilance conducted
* Meditators showed greatest gains in vigilance during the first month of retreat
* Improvement gained during retreat remained strong five months later but could be maintained by daily practice

**Future Research and Implications**

* More compelling evidence would come from demonstrating sustained improvement years after meditation retreats
* Meditation's impact on sustained attention has significant implications for mental focus, productivity, and overall well-being.

### WHEN ATTENTION BLINKS

**Attention Blinks**
- Momentary loss of ability to notice small changes in environment due to neural celebration after spotting a target (e.g., Waldo in a crowd)
- A "refractory period" for attention, resulting in temporary blindness
- Brain's way of conserving attentional resources
- Can miss important signals during this time

**Impact on Attention**
- During the blink, mind's ability to notice goes blind and attention loses sensitivity
- Can affect perception of emotions through nonverbal cues
- May result in missing major messages

**Attentional Blink Test**
- String of letters interspersed with occasional numbers presented very briefly
- Participants asked if they saw any numbers and what they were
- Most people tend to miss second number due to attentional blink
- Previously believed unchangeable, but research shows otherwise

**Meditators and Attentional Blink**
- Vipassana meditation may reduce attentional blink by 20%
- Nonreactive hyperalertness to all mental experiences during intensive retreat
- Mindfulness on steroids: continuous non-judgmental awareness of present moment
- Results in calmer response to first target, allowing for noticing of second one

**Aging and Attentional Blink**
- Attentional blink becomes more frequent and creates longer gaps in awareness as people get older
- Regular meditation practice reverses this trend
- Nonreactive open awareness may transfer to registering targets without getting caught up in them

**Mindfulness Training and Attentional Blink**
- Just 17 minutes of mindfulness training can reduce attentional blink in beginners
- Mindfulness training helps volunteers monitor their minds effectively
- Comparison group taught focusing meditation showed no effect on attentional blink

### THE MULTITASKING MYTH

**The Multitasking Myth**

* People today are inundated with information and distractions due to digital devices and social media
* Cognitive scientist Herbert A. Simon's observation: "What information consumes is attention. A wealth of information means a poverty of attention." (1971)

**Impact on Social Connections**

* Digital distractions diminish basic human skills like empathy and social presence
* Lack of attention to people around us sends a message of indifference
* Shift in social norms for giving attention to those we are with

**Myth of Multitasking**

* Brain does not truly multitask but rather switches rapidly between tasks
* Attention tasks don't go on in parallel, but require rapid switching and recovery
* Each switch diminishes the strength of attention for the original task
* Harmful effects:
  * Reduced ability to retain important information (signal vs noise)
  * Increased susceptibility to distractions
  * Overactivation of brain areas irrelevant to the task at hand
  * Decreased efficiency in multitasking and analytic understanding
  * Impaired empathy (Nass, Clifford)

### COGNITIVE CONTROL

**Cognitive Control:**
- Allows focusing on specific goals while resisting distractions
- Essential for jobs like air traffic control and daily tasks
- Can be strengthened through exercises, such as counting breaths or mindfulness meditation

**Multitasking:**
- Harms cognitive control by dividing attention and increasing distractions
- Short-term improvements in attention can be achieved through concentration workouts
- However, sustained efforts are needed to create lasting trait changes

**Attention:**
- Crucial for working memory and transferring information into long-term memory
- Mindfulness meditation has been shown to improve attention and working memory
- Improvements in attention have led to higher GRE scores for students

**Impulse Control (Response Inhibition):**
- Cognitive control also helps manage impulses
- Mindfulness meditation training has been shown to increase response inhibition
- Long-term benefits include improved emotional well-being and sustained ability to inhibit impulses

**Research Findings:**
- Three ten-minute sessions of breath counting improved attention skills for undergraduates, especially heavy multitaskers (state effect)
- Eight-minute mindfulness meditation session lessened mind-wandering in volunteers
- Two-week mindfulness training course improved concentration, working memory, and GRE scores for students
- Three-month mindfulness meditation training increased response inhibition and emotional well-being, with benefits lasting up to five months.

### META-AWARENESS

**Meta-Awareness:**
- Intense focus on noticing the movements of one's own mind
- Recognition of awareness itself as foremost
- Switching figure and ground in perception
- Awareness of awareness lets us monitor mind without being swept away by thoughts
- Scientifically referred to as "top-down" consciousness (conscious mind and mental doings) vs. "bottom-up" processes (unconscious mind)

**Top-Down:**
- Conscious mind and mental doings
- Thin slice of cognitive unconscious that comes to our attention
- Creates illusion of being the entirety of mind

**Bottom-Up:**
- Unconscious mind
- Vaster mental machinery of bottom-up processes
- Typically unaware of in everyday life

**Meta-Awareness Benefits:**
- Allows us to track attention and bring focus back to task
- Underlies effectiveness in various areas: learning, insight, project completion
- Different modes of awareness: engrossed vs. background

**Mere Awareness vs. Meta-Awareness:**
- Mere awareness: ordinary consciousness of a thing
- Meta-awareness: recognizing awareness itself without judgment or emotional reactions

**Example of Modes of Awareness:**
- Watching a movie: engrossed (lost in the plot) vs. watching attentively with background awareness

**Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC):**
- Key cortical area less active during unconscious mental processing
- Becomes more active as we become more aware of being aware

**Meta-Awareness Testing:**
- Cognitive psychologists test meta-awareness by giving challenging mental tasks and tracking errors and confidence in responses.
- Improves with mindfulness practice, but not with nutrition class.

### WILL IT LAST?

**Meditation and Attention:**

* Amishi Jha's research on intensive mindfulness retreats found:
  * Improvement in "alerting" or vigilant state of readiness, but no improvement in "orienting" for participants.
  * Some attention changes occur right away, others take longer.
  * Ongoing practice and intensive booster sessions may be necessary to maintain shifts in attention.

**Different Types of Meditation:**

* MBSR (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction) strengthens selective attention.
* Long-term Vipassana practice enhances attention even more.
* Enhanced vigilance after three-month shamatha retreat persisted for five months.
* Attentional blink lessened greatly after three months on a vipassana retreat and also showed transitory improvement in beginners after 17 minutes of mindfulness practice.

**Quickie Meditations:**

* Ten minutes of mindfulness overcame damage to concentration from multitasking (short term).
* Eight minutes of mindfulness lessened mind-wandering for a while.
* Ten hours of mindfulness over a two-week period strengthened attention and working memory, leading to substantial improved scores on graduate school entrance exam.

**Attention Subtypes:**

* Cognitive scientists argue that attention is too broad a concept; there are different subtypes.
* Meditation seems to enhance several of these subtypes but the full picture isn't clear yet.

**Caution:**

* Short-term meditation gains may not last if practice is not continued.
* Intensive retreats and ongoing practice may be necessary for lasting benefits.

**Historical Context:**

* William James, who lived near current meditation centers in Cambridge, likely would have benefited from practicing meditation had it been available during his lifetime.

## Chapter 8: Lightness of Being

**The Lightness of Being: Richie's Experience in Dalhousie Retreat**

* **Richie's revelation during Hour of Stillness**
  + No voluntary movement vow intensified his knee pain
  + Sudden awareness shift: pain disappeared into sensations
  + Raw sensation without emotional reactivity
* **Impact of not moving on the body**
  + Build-up of stress leading to excruciating pain
  + Shift in relationship to sensations
* **Understanding the nature of "pain"**
  + Label arising from myriad somatic sensations
  + Pain becomes just an idea, mental label
* **Insights into consciousness and perception**
  + Our experience built on expectations, projections, and neural processes
  + Consciousness as an integrator of elementary mental processes
* **Impact of awareness shift**
  + Ability to sit through longer sessions without discomfort
  + Deconstruction of self-centered narrative

**Richie's Revelation during Hour of Stillness**
* Pain intensified due to no-moving vow
* Sudden shift in awareness: pain disappeared into sensations
* Focusing on just the sensations: tingling, burning, pressure
* Raw sensation without emotional reactivity
* No longer "my pain"

**Impact of Not Moving on the Body**
* Stress build-up leading to excruciating pain
* Shift in relationship to sensations: pain becomes a mélange of physical sensations

**Understanding the Nature of "Pain"**
* What we label as "pain" is a joining together of myriad constituent somatic sensations
* Pain becomes just an idea, mental label put on raw sensations

**Insights into Consciousness and Perception**
* Our experience built on expectations, projections, habitual thoughts, and neural processes
* Consciousness as an integrator of elementary mental processes, most of which we are oblivious to
* Understanding not common in cognitive science during retreat days

**Impact of Awareness Shift**

* Ability to sit through longer sessions without discomfort
* Deconstruction of self-centered narrative: every waking moment constructs our experience around a narrative where we are the star.

### HOW OUR BRAIN CONSTRUCTS OUR SELF

**How our Brain Constructs the Self**

* Marcus Raichle's surprise finding of brain deactivation during cognitive tasks
* The brain consumes 20% of the body's metabolic energy, regardless of mental activity
* Raichle identified a default mode network (DMN) in the brain

**Default Mode Network (DMN)**

* Consists of the midline prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)
* Activates during relaxation, introspection, and self-referential thinking
* Calms down during focused mental tasks

**Function of DMN**

* Makes each individual the center of their universe
* Constantly rescripts our sense of "self" from memories, hopes, dreams, etc.
* Replays favorite or upsetting scenes in our minds
* Turns on during downtime and suppresses focus on external stimuli

**Implications of DMN**

* Our mind wanders mostly to thoughts about ourselves
* A wandering mind is linked to unhappiness
* High-risk activities and flow states suppress the default mode
* Meditation helps quiet the default mode by strengthening the connection between dorsolateral PFC and default areas

### DECONSTRUCTING THE SELF

**Deconstructing the Self:**

* Fifth-century Indian sage Vasubhandu's observation: staying bound to self leads to suffering (1)
* Meditation paths aim for ongoing inner freedom by reducing sense of self (1)
* Ordinary "self" is an illusion, as shown in Richie's pain experience (2)
* Buddha compared self to a chariot, which doesn't exist save as parts combined (3)
* Self emerges from neural subsystems: memories, perceptions, emotions, thoughts (4)

**Goals of Meditative Traditions:**

* Letting go of constant grasping or "stickiness" of thoughts, emotions, impulses (5)
* Dereification: realizing thoughts, feelings, and impulses are passing, insubstantial events (6)
* Emptiness: our self and seeming objects emerge from their components (7)
* Kenosis: emptying of self to grow openness to others (8)
* Weakening default circuitry to lessen "selfing" and concerns (9)
* Paradoxical lack of scientific research on meditation's effect on selflessness (10)

**Three Stages of Meditation leading to Greater Selflessness:**

* Stage 1: Focused attention meditation, quieting default mode network (DMN) through attention (11)
* Stage 2: Open monitoring meditation, observing thoughts and emotions without attachment (12)
* Stage 3: Transformative states, altering consciousness and dissolving the sense of self (13)

### THE DATA

**Mindfulness Meditation and Brain Activity:**

* David Creswell's research group at Carnegie Mellon University assessed brain activity in meditation novices during a three-day intensive mindfulness course.
* Volunteers learned to drop self-focused thoughts and shift attention to present moment awareness, heightening dorsolateral prefrontal area (DLPFC) activity.
* Increased connections formed between the DLPFC and primary region for self-focused thought in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC).

**Quieting the Default Mode:**

* Mindfulness practices help novices keep their mind from wandering by activating neural wiring that can quiet the default mode.
* With more experienced meditators, there is less activity in key sections of the default mode and heightened connections with control areas continue.
* Meta-awareness, or a "minimal self," plays a crucial role in loosening the self and monitoring thoughts, feelings, and actions.
* Lessened connectivity in the default mode circuitry during meditation was found in experienced meditators compared to novices and nonmeditators.

**Decreased Attachment:**

* During meditation practice, meditators are encouraged to distinguish between noting an experience and identifying with it, activating meta-awareness.
* Meditators had less activation within default mode areas during mindfulness practices, particularly when practicing loving-kindness meditation.
* Long-term meditators showed less activity in parts of the default area while focusing on their breath during brain scans, indicating a lasting drop in mind-wandering.

**Reduced Attachments and Gray Matter Volume:**

* Seasoned meditators had decreased gray matter volume in the nucleus accumbens compared to age-matched controls, suggesting a diminished attachment to the narrative self.
* This decrease in gray matter volume may reflect a neural circuit that brings a quiet enjoyment even as attachments wane.

**Implications for Attachment and Compassion:**

* Letting go of grasping or attachment opens up the ability to engage with other people's suffering and handle it without collapse.
* Meditation practice can lead to an ongoing compassion and bliss, but with "emptiness," or no attachment.
* Renunciation happens spontaneously rather than through force of will in long-term practitioners, creating a moral axis for action and compassion.

### A THIEF IN AN EMPTY HOUSE

**The shift from effortful to effortless practice**
- Ancient meditation manuals describe letting go of thoughts as a snake uncoiling itself at first, requiring effort, but later becoming effortless like a thief entering an empty house
- Neuroscience supports this idea with research on habit mastery and neural transitions

**Early stages of meditation:**
- Effortful practice activates prefrontal regulatory circuits
- Brain shows increased connectivity among default circuitry nodes and heightened PCC activity
- Novice meditators show high mental effort and increased biological markers

**Advanced stages of meditation:**
- Shift to effortless practice is marked by lessened connectivity among default circuitry nodes and decreased PCC activity
- Expert meditators show little effort in keeping focus one-pointed despite distractions
- Decrease in control circuitry role and self-referencing
- Potential discovery of new neural "self-systems" with further research on selflessness

**Universal theme:**
- Hard work at the start of learning any skill, followed by less effort and increased proficiency
- Brain conserves energy by putting actions on "automatic" as they become habitual

### A LACK OF STICKINESS

**Emotional Flexibility of the Dalai Lama**

* Exceptional affective flexibility: seamless transition between emotions
* Remarkable range of strong emotions: intense sadness to powerful joy
* Rapid, seamless transitions reflect a lack of stickiness

**Stickiness and Emotions**

* Stem from attachment and aversion in the brain
* Underlying causes of suffering in traditional texts
* Reflects the dynamics of emotional circuitry: amygdala and nucleus accumbens
* Spectrum runs from being stuck to instant freedom from emotions
* Traits of living without getting stuck: ongoing positivity, joy

**Default Mode Network (DMN)**

* Brain's default mode activates during idle thought or mental wandering
* Focuses on self and internal experiences
* Quieted during mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation
* Inhibition of default zones in early stages, waning connections in later practice
* State effect in early stages, enduring trait with long-term practitioners
* Decreased stickiness: less self-focused thoughts/feelings hijack attention

## Chapter 9: Mind, Body, and Genome

**MBSR (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction)**
- Developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in 1979
- Originally designed to help patients with chronic conditions and stress-related disorders
- Met with little resistance from physicians, as a way to improve quality of life without cure
- Initial program offered in basement room borrowed from physical therapy department
- Flourished due to positive patient feedback, expanded into Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society in 1995
- Now offered in hospitals and clinics worldwide, with over 600 published studies

**Benefits of MBSR:**
- Improves quality of life for patients with chronic conditions and stress-related disorders
- Can help reduce pain levels without negative side effects
- Encourages continuity of practice for long-term benefits

**Effectiveness on Pain:**
- Useful alternative to medical treatments with side effects or addiction potential
- Helps people relate to their pain better, but does not remove biological cause
- Effective in reducing disability and psychological symptoms related to pain

**Effectiveness on Fibromyalgia:**
- No known biological explanations for chronic pain, fatigue, stiffness, and insomnia of fibromyalgia
- One study failed to find impact on cardiac activity, another found improvements in psychological symptoms and subjective symptoms
- More frequent practice leads to better results
- Does not change underlying biology causing the pain

**Continuity of Practice:**
- Long-term benefits depend on continuity of practice
- Some patients drop practice after initial training
- Importance of daily practice for long-term pain relief, both physical and emotional.

### WHAT THE SKIN REVEALS

**What the Skin Reveals: The Impact of Stress on Health through the Lens of Skin Inflammation**

* Skin serves as the body's first line of defense against foreign agents and triggers inflammation in response to pathogens or stress.
* Stress worsens inflammation, which plays a significant role in diseases such as Alzheimer's, asthma, and diabetes.
* Human skin has an unusually large number of nerve endings, allowing the brain to signal neurogenic inflammation.
* Chilies contain capsaicin, which triggers skin inflammation and can be used to study stress effects on inflammation.

**Controlled Inflammation Studies: MBSR vs HEP**

* Richie's lab uses controlled patches of inflammation to test the effects of stress and meditation on inflammation.
* Melissa Rosenkranz develops a painless method for creating artificial blisters to measure pro-inflammatory cytokines.
* Study compares MBSR and HEP (active control treatment) participants during the Trier ordeal—a stressful job interview and math workout.

**Neurogenic Inflammation and the Brain's Response to Stress**

* The amygdala signals the HPA axis, triggering the release of epinephrine and cortisol in response to a stressor.
* Pro-inflammatory cytokines increase blood flow to wounds to supply immune products and ward off bacteria.
* Inflammation signals the brain through the insula, activating several neural circuits, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).
* The ACC modulates inflammation and connects thoughts, feelings, and autonomic activity.

**Impact of MBSR on Inflammation**

* No differences in subjective reports, cytokines, or cortisol levels between groups.
* MBSR group showed smaller patches of inflammation and faster healing after the stress test.
* MBSR practitioners with thirty-five minutes or more daily practice had lower pro-inflammatory cytokine levels.
* Early studies suggested that MBSR can help speed healing from psoriasis, but replication needed.

**Vipassana Meditators: Enhanced Impact of Mindfulness Practice on Inflammation**

* Highly experienced vipassana meditators (around 9,000 hours of practice) showed less stress response and lower cortisol levels than controls.
* Meditators reported better mental health despite not practicing during the measurements.
* Benefits observed even with as little as four weeks (thirty hours) of mindfulness or loving-kindness meditation practice.

**Impact on Health: Reducing Inflammation through Mindful Practice**

* Studies suggest that mindfulness practice reduces inflammation, both during meditation and in daily life.
* Destructive self-talk and constant stress exacerbate inflammation and age cells.
* Practicing mindfulness improves mental health, emotional wellbeing, and overall quality of life.

### HYPERTENSION? RELAX.

**Meditation and Hypertension:**
- Sayadaw U Pandita, Burmese monk and meditation master
- Renowned for precise version of mindfulness
- Direct lineage holder of Mahasi Sayadaw
- Spiritual guide to Aung San Suu Kyi
- Dan's experience at retreat under U Pandita's guidance in Arizona

**The Importance of Mindfulness Meditation**
- Building precise attention to breath
- Clear the mind, calm the body
- Dan's personal motivation: lower high blood pressure

**The Connection Between Meditation and Blood Pressure**
- Dr. Herbert Benson's early research on meditation and blood pressure
- Harvard Medical School cardiologist
- Dan's connection to Benson at Harvard
- Positive impact of meditation on blood pressure

**Research on Meditation and Blood Pressure**
- Study on African American men with kidney disease
- Results: lower metabolic patterns leading to diseases (encouraging but not conclusive)
- Larger, more rigorous studies needed

**Challenges and Future Directions**
- Mixed results in meta-analysis of clinical studies
- Lack of active control groups in many studies
- Need for well-designed studies to establish a causal relationship between meditation and blood pressure reduction

### GENOMICS

**Genomics and Epigenetics:**
- Genomic studies have moved beyond identifying genes to understanding their expression (is it on or off, and how much?)
- Epigenetic factors control gene expression
- Sugar turns on genes for diabetes; exercise turns them off
- Epigenetics is a frontier of genomic research

**Meditation and Epigenetics:**
- **Richie's Study:** Rejected proposal to study meditation's epigenetic impacts on inflammatory genes
- Meditation "down-regulates" genes responsible for inflammatory response
- Long-term Vipassana practitioners showed marked down-regulation of inflammatory genes after a day of practice
- Could help combat diseases with chronic low-grade inflammation, such as cardiovascular disorders, arthritis, diabetes, and cancer

**Other Studies on Meditation and Epigenetics:**
- **Loneliness and MBSR:** Loneliness spurs higher levels of pro-inflammatory genes; MBSR can lower levels and lessen feeling of loneliness
- **Relaxation Response:** Silent repetition of a chosen word as mantra has epigenetic impact
- **Yogic Meditation:** Reciting Sanskrit mantra aloud, in whisper, then silently with deep-breathing relaxation technique shows promise

**Meditation and Telomeres:**
- Longer telomere length = longer cell life span
- Increased telomerase activity = slower aging process
- Meta-analysis of mindfulness practices: increased telomerase activity
- Mindfulness and compassion meditation increase telomerase activity, depending on presentness and less mind-wandering during practice
- Loving-kindness meditation shows promise in pilot study

**Meditation and Panchakarma:**
- Mix of herbal medicines, massage, dietary changes, yoga with meditation (Ayurvedic medicine)
- Improvements in metabolic measures but cannot determine which intervention was the active agent

**Benefits of Meditation on Heart Rate:**
- Breath meditation is most relaxing
- Loving-kindness and mindfulness meditations boost heart rate slightly, indicating more effort required
- Highly experienced meditators (>30,000 hours) have slower heart rates during compassion meditation

**Breathing and Health:**
- Chronic rapid breathing is linked to anxiety disorders, chronic pain, and increased likelihood of stress reactions
- Slower breath rate indicates reduced autonomic activity, better mood, and improved health

**Richie's Study Findings:**
- Long-term meditators breathe an average 1.6 breaths more slowly than nonmeditators
- Over a single day, difference translates to >2,000 extra breaths for nonmeditators and >800,000 extra breaths per year
- Slower breathing indicates reduced autonomic activity, better mood, and salutary health effects.

### THE MEDITATOR’S BRAIN

**The Meditator's Brain:**

**Neural Benefits of Meditation**
- First reported in 2005 by Sara Lazar at Harvard Medical School
- Meditators had greater cortical thickness in areas important for sensing internal body state and attention (anterior insula, prefrontal cortex)

**Brain Imaging Studies**
- Stream of reports on increased size in meditator's brains
- Meta-analysis in 2013 combined 21 studies to see what held up

**Areas of the Brain that Enlarge with Meditation**
- Insula: attunes us to internal state, enhances emotional self-awareness
- Somatomotor areas: main cortical hubs for sensing touch and pain
- Prefrontal cortex: pays attention and operates in meta-awareness
- Cingulate cortex: instrumental in self-regulation
- Orbitofrontal cortex: part of the circuitry for self-regulation

**Meditation and Aging Brains**
- UCLA study finds meditation slows usual shrinkage of brain as we age
- Meditators' brains are "younger" by 7.5 years compared to nonmeditators at age 50

**Limitations of the Evidence**
- Findings could be due to factors like education or exercise, self-selection
- Differences may be due to specific meditation methods
- Studies have small number of participants and "squishy" brain measures
- Researchers tend to publish positive findings but not report nonfindings
- Brain measures have become more precise since many studies were done

**Promising Results from Small Studies**
- Some studies find increase in volume in parts of the brain with meditation practice
- Similar results come from mental training like memorization
- More participants and stringent criteria needed to reach definitive conclusions

**Distinguishing Different Types of Meditation Practice**
- Tania Singer's laboratory at Max Planck Institute is examining changes in cortical thickness associated with different types of meditation practice (empathy-based, open presence, focus on breath)
- Early findings suggest different types of training are associated with different anatomical effects on the brain. For example:
  - Empathy-based method enhances cortical thickness in temporoparietal junction (TPJ), active when we take another person's perspective
- Importance for meditation researchers to distinguish among different types of practice, particularly when it comes to pinpointing related changes in the brain.

### NEUROMYTHOLOGY

**Neuromythology and Meditation:**
- Richie's research on meditation and brain function has gained significant attention, with 2,813 citations as of writing.
- The study that went viral outside the academy is about a meditation training at a high-stress biotech start-up.

**Background:**
- Richie's research focused on the ratio of activity in the right versus left prefrontal cortex during rest.
- More right-side activity than left correlated with negative moods like depression and anxiety.
- A shift toward left-side activity was associated with buoyant moods.
- The general population fit a bell curve, with most of us in the middle.

**Study at Biotech Start-up:**
- Richie had Jon Kabat-Zinn teach Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to volunteers at the biotech start-up.
- Participants showed a remarkable shift from rightward pitch to leftward pitch after meditation training, with improved mood and reporting a more relaxed state.
- No such changes occurred in a comparison group on the waitlist.

**Issues and Questions:**
- The study was never replicated, and no active control like HEP was used for comparison.
- The findings are supported by other studies, such as one on patients with recurring episodes of severe depression.
- However, Richie's lab could not show that the leftward tilt grows stronger with more meditation practice.
- The failure to replicate with Olympic-level meditators and Tibetan yogis undermines confidence in the measure.
- It is unclear if a tilt toward the left occurs only at the beginning of meditation practice or if it reflects temporary pressures or basic temperament.
- Other mechanisms may kick in during later stages of meditation, changing one's relation to emotions rather than the ratio of positive to negative ones.
- Different branches of meditation may have disparate effects.
- The impact might vary depending on who teaches mindfulness.
- Jon Kabat-Zinn, as a unique teacher, may have had an influence beyond MBSR techniques.

### THE BOTTOM LINE

**The Bottom Line**
- Dan attended a meditation retreat hoping to lower his blood pressure
- Saw an initial drop, but it was uncertain if it was due to meditation or the "vacation effect"
- Weeks later, diagnosed with a rare hereditary adrenal disorder, which required medication to bring down his blood pressure

**Questions about Meditation and Health**
- What health benefits are true?
- What's not known?
- Strict standards applied to studies

**Findings from Research**
- Focus on psychological distress and palliative care instead of curing medical syndromes
- Improves quality of life for those with chronic diseases
- Unclear if meditation offers biological relief or cures specific medical conditions

**The Dalai Lama's Perspective**
- Skeptical about meditation as a cure-all for all health problems
- Experiences painful arthritis despite his extensive meditation practice

**Richie's Research and Findings**
- Controversial lecture at National Institutes of Health
- Focused on neural, biological, and behavioral changes wrought by meditation
- Short-term decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines after mindfulness training
- Increase in telomerase, which slows cellular aging, with intensive practice
- Inconclusive evidence about structural brain changes from short-term or long-term practice

**Meditation was not originally designed to treat illnesses**
- Studies suggest that mindfulness training may reduce inflammation and improve emotional regulation
- Further research is needed for specific health benefits and biological mechanisms.

## Chapter 10: Meditation as Psychotherapy

**Mindfulness Meditation as Psychotherapy: Integration of Mindfulness with Cognitive Therapy**
* Dr. Aaron Beck, founder of cognitive therapy, was introduced to mindfulness meditation by Tara Bennett-Goleman in the mid-1980s
* Tara, a student of vipassana meditation and recent graduate from a months-long retreat with U Pandita, shared her insights on mindfulness and its similarities to decentering in cognitive therapy
* Dr. Beck became interested in using mindfulness meditation as an adjunct to cognitive therapy, leading to the development of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)

**Integration of Mindfulness and Cognitive Therapy: Early Research**
* Tara Bennett-Goleman's book, Emotional Alchemy, was the first to integrate mindfulness with cognitive therapy
* MBCT was used by psychologist John Teasdale, Zindel Segal, and Mark Williams at the University of Oxford for patients with severe depression
* Their research revealed that MBCT cut the rate of relapse in half compared to medication, making it a significant alternative treatment

**Research on Mindfulness Meditation and Psychotherapy: Current Findings**
* A meta-analysis of 47 studies found that mindfulness meditation could lessen anxiety, depression, and pain (but not other health indicators) about as much as medications without side effects
* The main problem: insufficient evidence for long-term benefits and the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation compared to active control treatments like exercise or placebo
* Recommendation for more research with larger sample sizes and longer durations

**The Need for Upgrading Meditation Research**
* The meta-analysis used a broad range of search terms, yielding 18,753 citations; only about 4% (or 47) proved sufficiently well-designed to be included in the review
* The need to upgrade meditation research to meet the gold standard for clinical outcome research

**MBCT can have a role in treating depression, anxiety, and pain as much as medications but with no side effects**

### CHASING THE BLUES AWAY—WITH MINDFULNESS

**Chasing the Blues Away—With Mindfulness+**

**Remarkable Findings of MBCT in Severe Depression:**
- John Teasdale's group at Oxford found that MBCT cut relapse in severe depression by around 50%.
- This outreaches the effectiveness of any medication used for severe depression.
- The need for more rigorous studies was identified due to the lack of a control group and comparison activity in the original pilot study.

**Further Research:**
- Mark Williams, one of Teasdale's research partners, spearheaded more extensive research.
- Almost three hundred patients with severe depression were recruited for this study.
- Patients were randomly assigned to MBCT, cognitive therapy, or usual psychiatric treatments.
- Over six months, MBCT was found to be effective for patients with a history of childhood trauma.
- European researchers also confirmed MBCT's effectiveness for similar patient groups.
- A meta-analysis concluded that MBCT lowered relapse rates in severe depression by up to 50%.

**Why Does MBCT Work?**
- Zindel Segal studied the neurological reasons behind MBCT's success.
- Patients who showed greater insula activity after treatment had fewer relapses (35%).
- The best outcomes were for patients able to "decenter" and view their thoughts as transient.

**Applications of MBCT:**
- Effective in preventing depression during pregnancy and postpartum.
- Reduces symptoms of trauma, anxiety, depression, and improves sleep in prisoners.
- Beneficial for adolescents, reducing both overt and subtle signs of depression.

**Future Research:**
- Studies need replication and upgrades to meet strict medical review standards.
- MBCT might relieve symptoms of other psychiatric disorders; ongoing research explores underlying neural circuitry.
- Questions remain about the added value of mindfulness compared to cognitive therapy, which disorders it treats best, and specific meditation practices for different mental health issues.

### LOVING-KINDNESS MEDITATION FOR TRAUMA

**Loving-kindness Meditation for Trauma**

**Steve's Experience with Trauma and PTSD**
- Steve was working at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, when a jet crashed into the building.
- He experienced severe trauma, which intensified his existing PTSD from previous combat experiences in Desert Storm and Iraq.
- Symptoms of anger, frustration, hypervigilance, and distrust persisted for years.
- Steve hid his condition and appeared to be doing well to outsiders.
- He turned to alcohol and other methods to cope but was close to suicide before seeking help.

**Steve's Attempts at Self-Soothing and Healing**
- Steve entered Walter Reed Hospital for help, went through detox from alcohol, and began the road to healing.
- He learned about his condition and agreed to meet with a psychotherapist who introduced him to mindfulness meditation.
- He attempted to join a local mindfulness group but felt uncomfortable and walked out due to claustrophobia.
- He found relief in short mindfulness retreats, particularly the loving-kindness practice.

**Introduction to Mindfulness Meditation and Loving-Kindness Practice**
- The loving-kindness practice involves cultivating compassion for oneself and others.
- It helped Steve feel "at home again" and provided a sense of calm during moments of anger or frustration.

**Research Findings on Loving-Kindness Meditation for PTSD**
- Forty-two veterans with PTSD took a twelve-week course in loving-kindness meditation at the Seattle Veterans Administration hospital.
- Three months later, their PTSD symptoms had improved, and depression had lessened slightly.
- More research is needed to determine if loving-kindness practice is more effective than other treatments, such as HEP (Health Enhancement Program).

**Benefits of Loving-Kindness Practice for Veterans with PTSD**
- Loving-kindness meditation offers a cost-effective group treatment for the large proportion of veterans suffering from PTSD.
- The practice might help reverse emotional numbness, alienation, and a sense of "deadness" in relationships.
- Many veterans prefer nontraditional treatments due to side effects of prescribed medications and have been seeking alternative methods like loving-kindness meditation.

### DARK NIGHTS

**Meditative Dark Nights:** A Crisis Experienced by Some Meditators

* **Jay Michaelson's Experience:** Recalled a wave of intense self-hatred and mental distress during a Vipassana retreat, which he calls a "dark night" (DN).
* **Transitory Lightness:** Most likely to occur at the point when thoughts become transient.
* **Arising and Passing:** A landmark on the path where thoughts seem to disappear quickly.
* **Mental States in Dark Nights:** Morbid doubt, self-loathing, anger, guilt, and anxiety.
* **Resolution:** Michaelson learned to observe his mind rather than being consumed by the thoughts, leading to the end of the episode.

**The Need for Research and Support:**

* **Onset of Dark Nights:** Not always related to psychiatric histories or vipassana meditation; can occur in any meditative tradition.
* **Understanding and Recovery:** Willoughby Britton, a psychologist at Brown University, heads the "dark night project," offering support to those suffering from meditation-related psychological difficulties.
* **Base Rates:** No precise information on the proportion of meditators experiencing dark nights or in the general population.
* **Research Question:** Whether intensive meditation practice puts certain people at risk for psychological crises over and above the base rate.

**Dark Nights in Different Traditions:**

* **Kabbalistic Texts:** Caution against contemplative methods for those with unformed egos, to prevent falling apart.
* **Intensive Meditation Practice:** No conclusive evidence if it poses a danger to specific individuals or if dark nights are inevitable regardless of circumstances.

**Support and Resources:**

* **Dark Night Project:** Helps people understand and recover from meditation-related psychological difficulties.
* **Meditation's Popularity:** Gaining acceptance among psychotherapists despite the low but present risk of dark nights during prolonged retreats.

### MEDITATION AS METATHERAPY
**Meditation as Metatherapy:**

* Dan's first article proposing meditation as a tool in psychotherapy (1971) met with little interest from psychotherapists.
* During his talk at Massachusetts Psychological Association, he met Jack Kornfield, a graduate student interested in meditation and its therapeutic applications.
* Jack became a pioneer in incorporating Buddhist psychological theories into modern sensibility and founded Insight Meditation Society and Spirit Rock.
* Mark Epstein, a psychiatrist, was influenced by Dan's psychology of consciousness course at Harvard and later wrote several books on psychoanalytic and Buddhist perspectives on mind.

**Key Figures:**

* Jack Kornfield: Founded Insight Meditation Society and Spirit Rock, translated Buddhist theories into modern language, designed teacher training programs.
* Mark Epstein: Psychiatrist, student of Dan's, wrote several books integrating psychoanalytic and Buddhist views on mind.

**Impact on Psychotherapy:**

* Meditation-based approaches gaining popularity among psychotherapists despite limited scientific research.
* Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has become the most empirically well-validated psychological treatment with a meditation basis.
* 1,125 articles on mindfulness-based interventions in scientific literature as of writing, majority published in last five years.

**Benefits of Meditation:**

* Decreases depression (severe depression), anxiety, and pain about as much as medications but with no side effects.
* Reduces psychological stress to a lesser degree.
* Loving-kindness meditation helpful for trauma patients, especially those with PTSD.

**Limitations of Meditation:**

* Not originally intended to treat psychological problems.
* Has its limits and may not be effective for all disorders.
* Occasional reports of negative effects, but overall findings underscore potential promise.

**Future of Meditation in Psychotherapy:**

* Increasing interest and research in meditation-based strategies for a wider range of psychological disorders.

## Chapter 11: A Yogi’s Brain

**11 A Yogi’s Brain: The Failed Scientific Expedition**

**Background:**
- Intrepid team of scientists traveled to McLeod Ganj, India, in 1992 to assess brain activity of Tibetan yogis on retreat
- Team consisted of Richie and Cliff Saron, with equipment for EEG measurements, computers, batteries, and generators

**Challenges:**
- Yogis lived in remote hermitages, requiring porters for transportation
- Lack of roads made access difficult
- Yogis had no prior knowledge or interest in science
- Fear of negative impact on their practices or reputation

**Preparation:**
- Dalai Lama identified yogis as experts in lojong mind training method
- Scientists obtained a letter from the Dalai Lama requesting cooperation
- Sent a personal emissary to vouch for the request

**Obstacles:**
- Yogis refused to participate, citing various reasons such as:
  - Fear of negative impact on their practices or reputation
  - Unfamiliarity with science and its relevance to their practices
  - Personal indifference towards scientific measurements or rankings

**Lessons Learned:**
- Bringing meditators to the equipment, especially in a well-fortified brain lab, would be more effective
- Unique challenges for research on adepts, including:
  - Rarity of subjects
  - Intentional remoteness
  - Indifference towards personal gain or recognition
- Minimal prospects for scientific studies due to yogis' priorities and values.

### A SCIENTIST AND A MONK

**Matthieu Ricard's Background:**
- French molecular geneticist with a degree from Pasteur Institute under François Jacob, Nobel laureate in Medicine.
- Abandoned promising career in biology to become a monk.
- Old friend of the authors and participated in dialogues between Dalai Lama and scientists.
- First monk to study at Richie's lab as experimental subject and collaborator.
- Co-author on journal article reporting initial findings with yogis.
- Personal attendant to Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, revered Tibetan meditation master.
- At the heart of large network within the Tibetan meditative world, knew whom to suggest for studies and could reassure potential subjects.

**The Dalai Lama's Call to Action:**
- During "destructive emotions" dialogue, Dalai Lama urged Richie to test meditation rigorously and extract value for larger world.
- Matthieu was inspired by this call and used his scientific expertise to conduct studies with yogis.

**Matthieu's Role in Recruiting Advanced Meditators:**
- Reassured potential subjects that their efforts would be worthwhile, helping other people rather than for personal gain.
- Emphasized motivation of scientists to promote incorporation of practices into Western culture if findings supported their efficacy.
- Bringing 21 most advanced meditators to Richie's lab for brain studies, including 7 Westerners and 14 Tibetan adepts.

### FIRST, SECOND, AND THIRD PERSONS

**Molecular Biology and First-Person Research:**
- Matthieu, with background in molecular biology, volunteered as first guinea pig for a unique brain training study (First Person)
- Unusual yet precedented in scientific research for assuring safety of new medical treatments (First Person)
- Studying the mind and shaping the brain requires a ""first-person"" report of inner experience and ""third-person"" objective measures
- Closing the gap between first and third person: Francisco Varela proposed combining first, second, and third-person perspectives for more precise data

**Combining First-, Second-, and Third-Person Perspectives:**
- Francisco Varela introduced a method of using an expert (Second Person) on the topic being studied to bridge the gap between first and third person
- The person being studied should have a well-trained mind (First Person) for better data
- Meditator Matthieu, as both expert and volunteer, provided valuable insights into meditation practices for Richie's team

**Grounded Theory Approach:**
- Grounded theory approach: generating hypotheses based on direct personal experience of what is being studied
- Long before Matthieu's involvement, Richie and Dan immersed themselves in meditation to generate grounded theories (First Person)

**Mistakes and Learning from the Past:**
- Previous research on a meditator claiming to enter nibbana state (First Person)
- Main tool was an assay of blood levels of cortisol (Third Person), which was irrelevant for measuring nibbana state
- The limitations of this approach: lack of methodological precision and reliance on outdated methods

**Future of Contemplative Science:**
- Dalai Lama's vision of the person being studied and researcher being one and the same (First Person)
- Introducing a Tibetan-language science curriculum in monasteries (Radical Move: First, Second, and Third Perspectives)
- Encouraging collaboration between experts and practitioners for more precise data and better understanding of inner experiences.

### THE JOY OF LIVING

**The Joy of Living: Mingyur Rinpoche's Brain Assessment at Wisconsin Lab**

**Background**
- A Tibetan monk, Mingyur Rinpoche, arrives at Madison, Wisconsin lab for brain assessment while meditating
- Journeyed from Nepal monastery, took three days and crossed ten time zones
- Richie had met him briefly in 1995 but forgot his appearance
- Unique identifier: shaven head and gold-and-crimson robes

**Brain Assessment Preparation**
- Arrived at lab's EEG room with EEG cap for brain wave measurement
- Scalp preparation took longer due to Mingyur's bald, thickened skin
- Patience and kindness evident during lengthy process

**Scientific Protocol**
- **Compassion meditation**: one minute
- **Neutral resting period**: thirty seconds
- Four cycles required for reliable results
- Richie and team skeptical of instantaneous entry into mental states
- John Dunne, Buddhist scholar, provided translation

**Unexpected Findings**
- Huge bursts of electrical activity during compassion meditation
- No visible movement from Rinpoche during meditation periods
- Repeated pattern confirmed during subsequent cycles
- Team amazed and excited by the observations

**Significance of Discovery**
- Inflection point in neuroscience history
- Over 1,100 citations as of writing in scientific literature
- Scientific stir caused by this session

**Key Players**
- Richie
- Mingyur Rinpoche
- Lab technicians
- John Dunne (Buddhist scholar)

**Challenges Encountered**
- Thickened, callused skin on Mingyur's scalp for electrode attachment
- Skepticism from Richie and team regarding instant meditation entry

**Equipment Used**
- EEG room with shower cap-like electrode holder (256 sensors)

### A MISSED BOAT

**Mingyur Rinpoche's Experience at Harvard University:**

* Invited to cognitive scientist's lab for assessment
* Put through two protocols: visualization and extrasensory perception
* Failed both tests, doing no better than college sophomores
* Reason for failure: Mingyur had not practiced visualization for years
* Current practice: ongoing open presence, letting go of thoughts
* Scientist's expectations: based on limited understanding of Mingyur's meditative expertise

**Traditional Scientific Approach:**

* "Subject" (volunteer) goes through experimental protocol designed by researcher
* Researchers design experiments without consultation from subjects
* Subjects considered naive about research purpose and methods
* Focus on hypotheses and previous studies, not subject's expertise

**Misjudging Meditators' Strengths:**

* First-person estrangement: researchers lack understanding of meditative practices
* Third-person estrangement: failure to consider the individual's unique strengths
* Comparing meditators to their prowess in other areas, like testing Jack Nicklaus on basketball free throws instead of golf.

### NEURAL PROWESS

**Neural Profiling of Mingyur's Brain Activity:**

* Mingyur undergoes fMRI testing in Richie's lab.
* fMRI provides spatial precision and reveals neural locations of brain activity.
* Complementary to EEG, which tracks electrical brain activity more precisely in time.
* During compassion meditation, Mingyur's empathy circuitry shows an extreme increase (700-800%) in activity compared to rest period, surpassing normal levels and resembling epileptic seizures but with intentional control.

**Background of Mingyur:**

* Meditation prodigy with a lifetime practice of 62,000 hours.
* Grew up in a family of meditation experts: Tsoknyi Rinpoche, Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche, Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche, and his father Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche.
* Family members were renowned for their long retreats: Tulku Urgyen (more than twenty years), grandfather (more than thirty years).
* At a young age, Mingyur enjoyed pretending to be a yogi meditating in a cave and entered a three-year meditation retreat at thirteen.
* **Proficient in meditation by the end of his first retreat and appointed as meditation master for the next three-year round.

### THE WANDERER RETURNS

**The Wanderer Returns**
**Mingyur Rinpoche's Unique Brain Development**
* Mingyur Rinpoche visited Richie's lab in June 2016 after eight years, having spent the previous years as a wandering mendicant.
* Previously, he had gone on a three-year retreat but disappeared without notice, living as a wanderer in India and Himalayan caves.

**Wandering Retreat:**
* Such a retreat is rare among modern Tibetans.
* During his wandering years, Mingyur gave no word about his whereabouts or condition.
* A photo surfaced showing a radiant face with a wispy beard and long hair.
* In November 2015, he reappeared at his monastery in Bodh Gaya.

**Neuroimaging:**
* Mingyur agreed to have an MRI scan at Richie's lab during a visit to America.
* Technology had improved since his last visit, providing crisper images of his brain's folds and tucks.
* Longitudinal data from previous scans was used for comparison.

**Aging Brain:**
* Mingyur's brain ages more slowly than expected based on chronological age.
* Using anatomical landmarks, Mingyur's brain falls into the 99th percentile for his age group.
* His brain appears closer to norms for those aged thirty-three.
* The data highlights neuroplasticity and the potential benefits of intentional mental exercise.

**Seasoned Meditation Adepts:**
* Mingyur's case is part of a larger research program studying world-class meditation experts.
* Twenty-one yogis have participated in this brain research project, including Matthieu Ricard.
* Yogis had initially been reluctant to participate but were encouraged by the potential benefits for others.

**Mingyur's Neural Performance:**
* During compassion meditation, Mingyur showed a significant increase in electrical activity and empathy circuitry.
* His years of practice as a wanderer have resulted in ongoing mental exercise, making meditation an enduring trait rather than a discrete act.

**Impact on Brain Science:**
* Richie's lab is continuing to study the data from these yogis, providing unprecedented insights into the history of contemplative traditions and brain science.

## Chapter 12: Hidden Treasure

**Mingyur's Visit to Madison and the Twenty-One Yogis:**
- Mingyur's visit to Richie's lab in Madison resulted in jaw-dropping findings.
- Twenty-one yogis, who had undergone extensive meditation training, were formally tested.
- Their meditation experience ranged from 12,000 to 62,000 hours.

**Meditation Practice and Retreats:**
- Each yogi completed a three-year retreat with at least eight hours of daily formal practice.
- This equated to approximately 9,500 hours per retreat.
- All underwent the same scientific protocol.

**Scientific Testing and Findings:**
- Four one-minute cycles of various meditations were used for testing.
- Yogis entered specified meditative states at will with distinctive neural signatures.
- Remarkable mental dexterity was observed, allowing them to shift awareness instantly between compassion, openness, and focus.
- These shifts in awareness were accompanied by measurable brain activity changes.
- Collective mental gymnastics of this magnitude had never been observed by science before.

### A SCIENTIFIC SURPRISE

**Scientific Surprise**
- Francisco, a bedridden neuroscientist, sent his student Antoine Lutz to a meeting with the Dalai Lama instead of him.
- Antoine and Richie, another scientist, met for the first time before the meeting and developed a strong scientific partnership due to their complementary backgrounds.
- Antoine spent the next ten years working in Richie's lab analyzing EEGs and fMRIs of yoga practitioners.

**Discovering a Hidden Pattern**
- The team focused on temporary state effects by comparing baseline brain activity with that during meditation periods.
- While reviewing the initial baseline measurements, Richie and Antoine discovered an "amazing" pattern: all yogis had elevated gamma oscillations during their resting state.

**Understanding Gamma Oscillations**
- EEG waves are classified by frequency (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma).
- Gamma oscillations occur when brain regions fire in harmony and last for short moments (usually a fraction of a second).
- These moments often correspond to insights or creative thoughts.

**The Yogis' Unique Brain Activity**
- The yogis displayed much stronger gamma oscillations during baseline measurements compared to the control group.
- This sustained, brain-entraining gamma pattern was an unprecedented finding in neuroscience.

**Gamma Oscillations During Deep Sleep**
- Research by Davidson's group showed that long-term vipassana meditators exhibit gamma oscillations during deep sleep, which is also unusual.

**Implications of the Discovery**
- The yogis' neural activity shows an enduring transformation due to meditation practice.
- This discovery could potentially lead to a better understanding of consciousness and altered states.

### STATE BY TRAIT

**State by Trait Interaction:**
- Antoine's study showed no difference between volunteers' brains at rest and during meditation
- Yogis exhibit vastly different results, with significant brain changes during meditation
- Sustained practice over a lifetime explains the difference between novices and masters
- Yogis' ability to enter meditative state quickly is an altered trait

**Altered Trait:**
- Indicates permanent changes in the brain and biology due to meditation practice
- Meditation-induced changes are visible before beginning to meditate
- Examples of altered traits: elevated gamma activity in yogis during meditation

**State by Trait Interaction (Continued):**
- Temporary state changes only observable in those with enduring altered traits
- Long-term meditators and yogis exhibit this effect

**Yogis' Meditation Skills:**
- Ability to enter meditative state quickly on cue
- Indicates altered trait, giving rise to special abilities during meditation
- Signals heightened speed of onset, greater intensity, and extended duration

**Altered State:**
- Refers to changes that occur only during meditation

**Open Presence:**
- Meditative state practiced by yogis
- Instruction is to mingle the state with everyday life and transform it into a trait.

### READY FOR ACTION

**Neuroscientific Study on Compassion Meditation: Yogis vs. Beginners**

**Ready for Action:**
* Participants underwent brain scans during compassion meditation practice.
* Two groups included meditation novices and experienced Tibetan and Western yogis (average 34,000 hours of practice).
* Compassion practice involved bringing to mind someone cared about deeply and then extending loving-kindness to all beings.
* Participants heard random sounds during the session, including happy, neutral, and distressing ones.

**Neural Response:**
* Brain response to suffering sounds was stronger in yogis than beginners.
* Expertise in compassion practice increased neural activity in circuits related to mental states and perspective-taking.
* Yogis showed greater activation in brain areas like the amygdala, key for salience and attention to distress.
* Unique to yogis was a jump in motor centers' activity, indicating readiness to act.

**Neural Profile:**
* The neural profile during compassion meditation reflected an endpoint of change for yogis.
* Beginners did not exhibit this pattern initially but showed progression with practice.

**Preparation for Action:**
* Yogis reported feeling prepared to help upon encountering suffering, counteracting normal tendencies to withdraw.
* This preparation was linked to their training and focus on acceptance and openness to situations and emotions.

**Additional Findings:**
* Yogis showed less activity in the postcingulate cortex (PCC) when hearing sounds of suffering, suggesting a priming of focus on others.
* Stronger connection between PCC and prefrontal cortex in yogis suggested "down-regulation" of self-concern, enhancing compassionate action.

### PRESENCE TO PAIN

**Eighteenth-Century Tibetan Text and Modern Meditation Advice**
- Encourages practicing meditation on any situation, including pain
- Pain can be effective in focusing attention during meditation
- Treating pain as a friend helps acceptance and reduces resistance

**Thermal Stimulator Study: Control Group (Meditation-Naive Volunteers)**
- Trained to generate open presence before the study
- Activated pain matrix strongly during anticipation, reactivity, and recovery
- Anticipatory anxiety increases pain response and prolongs suffering

**Thermal Stimulator Study: Yogis (Advanced Meditators)**
- Practiced open presence with greater intensity than controls
- Minimal reaction in the pain matrix during anticipation of pain
- Heightened sensory response to pain, less emotional reactivity
- Quick recovery from pain, almost as though nothing had happened

**Inverted V-Shaped Pattern and Emotion Regulation**
- Minimal reaction during anticipation, followed by intense response at the actual moment, then swift recovery is adaptive
- Helps be fully responsive to challenges without emotional interference before or after
- Fear of dental appointments as a child vs. maturity as an adult: similar analogy to the yogis' growth in meditation practice

**State by Trait Effect**
- The state of open presence during the pain study is a temporary state
- However, years of meditation practice and training lead to enduring changes in the yogis' reactions to pain. This is a state by trait effect.

### EFFORTLESS

**Meditation Practice and Increased Ease:**

- Beginners report increased ease and enjoyment after weeks of daily practice (Brewer's study, 10 weeks).
- Long-term meditators report effortless awareness during meditation, associated with decreased PCC activation.
  - Undistracted awareness, effortless doing, not efforting, contentment: all correspond to lower PCC activation.
  - Distracted awareness, efforting, discontentment: all correspond to higher PCC activation.
- Beginners experience relative ease going from great effort to improved focus, but not the same level as long-term meditators or yogis.

**Measuring Effortlessness:**

- One measure is the ability to maintain focus on a chosen point and resist distractions without making an effort.
  - Prefrontal activation may increase at first with practice but decreases with greater expertise.
- Comparing meditators with most vs least practice hours shows minimal prefrontal activation for experts.
  - Activation occurs only briefly at the beginning of a practice period for beginners, dropping away once focus is achieved.
- Another measure is emotional resilience: response to emotional sounds.
  - Experienced meditators (>44,000 hours) hardly respond to emotional sounds vs those with less practice (19,000 hours).
  - A 400% difference in amygdala activation exists between groups, indicating selective attention and brain's ability to block out extraneous sounds.
- The dosage-response relationship suggests that brain function continues to alter even at high levels of practice (up to 50,000 hours).

**Assessing Lifetime Hours:**

- Assessing total lifetime hours of meditation practice is crucial for understanding the neural adaptations and reaching findings like effortlessness among highly experienced yogis.
- Without this simple metric, valuable findings may be overlooked or buried in general comparisons between novices and experts.

### THE HEART-MIND

**The Heart-Mind+**
* In 1992, researchers led by Richie brought equipment to India to study meditation masters near the Dalai Lama's residence.
* They were unable to gather data from mountain-dwelling yogis but gave a live demonstration of brain electrical signal recording to monks at Namgyal Monastery Institute of Buddhist Studies.
* The monks were amused by researchers' interest in studying compassion while placing electrodes on the head instead of the heart.
* It took fifteen years for researchers to realize that compassion is an embodied state with strong brain-heart connection, which they discovered through analyzing yogis' brain activity and heart rate.
* The discovery of heart rate variability (HRV) coupled with insula activity during compassion meditation in yogis confirmed the monks' point.
* Yogis showed enhanced empathy and heightened sensitivity to their own bodies, especially their hearts, during nonreferential compassion meditation.

**EEG Demonstration at Namgyal Monastery**
* In 1992, Richie and colleagues gave a talk on brain electrical signal recording to monks at the Namgyal Monastery Institute of Buddhist Studies.
* Instead of a dry academic talk, they decided to give a live demonstration using neuroscientist Francisco Varela as the subject.
* The monks were surprised to see electrodes being placed on Francisco's head rather than his heart for compassion study.
* It took time and effort to place the electrodes, leading to some mishaps like Francisco's wires looking like a bundle of spaghetti.

**The Yogis' Compassion Meditation**
* The yogis' compassion meditation was found to be different from other types of meditation or resting state as it sharpened their sense of others' emotions and heightened sensitivity to their own bodies, particularly the heart.
* It was a nonreferential form of compassion, generating love and compassion permeating the whole mind without focusing on any specific person.

**The Brain-Heart Connection during Compassion Meditation**
* Yogis' brain activity during compassion meditation showed tight links between their brains and hearts through the insula, which acts as a portal for body information to reach the brain and vice versa.
* This finding suggested that with yogic training, the brain becomes more finely tuned to the heart, especially during compassion meditation.

**Other Mental Functions Changing with Mind Training**
* Long-term meditators have fewer attentional blinks, which is one of the many mental functions that change with rigorous mind training.
* These findings challenge the assumptions in cognitive science and suggest that altered traits are another option beyond our ordinary state of waking consciousness.

**The Global Significance of Yogis**
* Encounters with rare yogis, who radiate inner qualities and wisdom, are enriching and inspiring experiences.
* It's important for nations and cultures to protect and preserve these beings and their communities of expertise and practice, as well as the cultural attitudes that value these altered traits.
* Losing the way to this inner expertise would be a world tragedy.

**Key Findings on Yogis**
* Enhanced present moment awareness with little anticipation or rumination reflected in strong gamma activity and synchrony across widespread regions of the brain.
* Effortless concentration with quick attention placement and minimal effort to hold focus.
* Emotional resonance through heightened sensitivity to their own bodies, especially their hearts.
* Nonreferential compassion generating love and compassion permeating the whole mind without focusing on any specific person.
* Altered traits are another option beyond our ordinary state of waking consciousness.
* Yogis are rare beings who radiate inner qualities and wisdom that need protection and preservation.

## Chapter 13: Altering Traits

**Long-Term Meditation Benefits**

* **Deepening Effects:** After reaching around 1,000 to 10,000 hours of meditation practice, several benefits emerge:
  * **Neural and Hormonal Indicators:** Lessened stress reactivity with neural and hormonal changes.
  * **Emotion Regulation:** Strengthened functional connectivity in brain circuits important for emotion regulation.
  * **Cortisol Levels:** Decreased cortisol levels, a key stress hormone.
* **Compassion Practice:** Enhanced neural resonance with another person's suffering and increased concern and helping likelihood.
* **Attention Improvements:**
  * **Selective Attention:** Sharper selective attention.
  * **Attentional Blink:** Diminished attentional blink.
  * **Sustained Attention:** Easier sustained attention.
  * **Alert Readiness:** Increased alert readiness to respond.
* **Mind-Wandering and Self-Preoccupation:** Reduced mind-wandering and self-obsessed thoughts.
* **Biological Processes:** Shifts in basic biological processes like slower breath rate.
* **Brain Changes:** Neuroplasticity from long-term practice leading to structural and functional brain changes, such as greater working connection between the amygdala and regulatory circuits in the prefrontal areas.
* **Nucleus Accumbens:** Decreased size of neural circuits associated with wanting or attachment.
* **Dose-Response Dynamic:** Different rates of change in disparate neural systems, such as faster compassion benefits compared to stress mastery.
* **State-by-Traits Effects:** Long-term meditators may undergo state-by-trait effects that enhance practice potency.
* **Gamma Waves:** Elements of the meditative state like gamma waves may continue during sleep.
* **Immune System Response:** One-day retreats by seasoned meditators benefited immune response at the genetic level.

**Neural and Hormonal Changes:**
* Long-term meditation practice leads to neural and hormonal indicators of lessened stress reactivity.
* This range of meditation hours, around 1,000 to 10,000, may involve daily practice and annual retreats for sustained growth over many years.

**Emotion Regulation:**
* Functional connectivity in the brain's emotion regulation circuit is strengthened.
* Cortisol levels, a key hormone secreted by the adrenal gland in response to stress, lessen.

**Compassion Practice:**
* Long-term loving-kindness and compassion practice enhances neural resonance with another person's suffering.
* Increased concern and likelihood of helping are observed.

**Attention Improvements:**
* Selective attention sharpens.
* Attentional blink diminishes.
* Sustained attention becomes easier.
* Alert readiness to respond increases.

**Mind-Wandering and Self-Preoccupation:**
* Long-term practitioners show enhanced ability to down-regulate mind-wandering thoughts of the default mode.
* Weakening connectivity within those circuits signifies less self-preoccupation.

**Biological Processes:**
* Slower breath rate is one shift in basic biological processes that occurs only after several thousand hours of practice.

**Brain Changes:**
* Neuroplasticity from long-term meditation practice leads to both structural and functional brain changes.
* Greater working connection between the amygdala and regulatory circuits in the prefrontal areas is observed.
* Nucleus accumbens associated neural circuits, responsible for wanting or attachment, appear to shrink in size with longer-term practice.

**Dose-Response Dynamic:**
* Different rates of change are expected in disparate neural systems as studies in the future will fill in the details of a dose-response dynamic for various brain circuits.

**State-by-Traits Effects:**
* Long-term meditators may undergo state-by-trait effects that enhance practice potency.
* Some elements of the meditative state, like gamma waves, may continue during sleep.

**Immune System Response:**
* A one-day retreat by seasoned meditators benefited their immune response at the genetic level, surprising the medical establishment.

### THE YOGIS

**Effect of Extensive Meditation Practice (roughly 12,000 to 62,000 hours):**

* **Conversion of meditative states to traits:** Yogis get familiar with meditative mindset.
* **Merging of meditation states and daily activities:** Altered states stabilize into altered traits.
* **Signs of altered traits:** Changes in brain function and structure, positive human qualities.
* **Synchronized gamma oscillations:** State becomes a trait for yogis.
* **State-by-trait interactions:** Differences between yogis and novices during meditation.

**Physical Pain Response:**

* **Reduced brain activity during anticipation:** Concentration becomes effortless for yogis.
* **Intense but short peak during pain:** Neural circuits for effortful attention go quiet.
* **Rapid recovery:** Yogis' attention stays perfectly focused during and after pain.

**Neurological Changes:**

* **Strengthening of heart-brain coupling:** During compassion meditation.
* **Shrinking nucleus accumbens:** Suggests lessening of attachment, grasping, and self-focus.
* **Further neural shifts:** Await deciphering in future research.

### THE AFTER

**Contemplative Path at Advanced Levels**
- Remarkable data points hinting at full flowering of contemplative path
- Some findings discovered by chance: checking baseline data, comparing seasoned group to rest
- Anecdotal evidence: extremely low cortisol levels in yogi's saliva
- Buddhist traditions refer to this level as recognition of inner "basic goodness"
- Expert meditators have a steady background of meditative accomplishments for all activities

**Altered Traits in Research**
- Altered traits compared between expert and beginner meditators
- More advanced meditators show brain pattern resembling meditative state during rest
- Comparison of expert's baseline to beginner's stands as a hallmark of altered trait research
- Long-term studies may one day provide insight into how altered traits emerge

**Meditation and Resting State**
- Meditation transforms resting state to resemble meditative state
- Brewer group conjectured this based on research findings
- Our previous term for this concept: "the after is the before for the next during"

### IN SEARCH OF LASTING CHANGE

**Meditation and Lasting Change**

* Quote from Francis de Sales: Bring heart back to focus even when it wanders (1567-1622)

**Common Steps in Meditation**

* Intended focus
* Mind wanders
* Bring mind back to focus

**Research Findings**

* Brain regions involved in meditation steps stronger among seasoned meditators (Wendy Hasenkamp, Emory University)
* Differences between meditators and controls found not just during meditation but in resting state as well

**Longitudinal Studies**

* Tania Singer's work on empathy and compassion (ReSource Project)
	+ No improvement in interoception after three months of daily practice
	+ Improvements begin to show up after six months, with even bigger gains after nine months
* Cliff Sarron's study on shamatha meditation

**Unexpected Findings**

* Some benefits take time to ripen (sleeper effect)

**Cautionary Tale of the Yogi**

* Test of practice is life itself, not isolated hours in meditation
* Trait like patience should leave us unflappable in real-life challenges

**The Dalai Lama's Perspective**

* A practitioner can appear holy during good times but may lose composure during crises
* Full catastrophe of our lives offers the best durability test of altered traits.

### EXPERTISE

**Expertise and Deliberate Practice:**

- Contrary to popular belief, expertise in certain domains can be achieved in fewer than 10,000 hours of practice (e.g., memorization may only require 200 hours).
- Expertise continues to increase with the number of lifetime hours, even for those who have already put in 10,000 hours (like meditation adepts).
- The quality of practice hours is more important than the quantity.
- "Deliberate" practice involves receiving feedback from an expert coach to improve targeted areas of progress.
- Professional performers and experts across various fields continue to have coaches throughout their careers for further improvement.

**Meditation:**

- Meditating daily versus retreats result in different outcomes (greater prefrontal-amygdala connectivity and slower breathing correlated with retreat hours).
- Teachers or guides provide valuable coaching and feedback during meditation practice, especially on retreats.
- The intensity of retreat practice contributes to the unique opportunity for amplified learning.

**Differences Between Amateurs and Experts:**

- Amateurs improve initially but often level off after about 50 hours of practice.
- Experts engage in intensive sessions under the guidance of a coach, leading to continuous learning and steady improvements.

**Finding a Guidance or Teacher:**

- Seeking guidance from a more experienced meditation teacher is crucial for progress.
- Ancient texts like the Visuddhimagga advise finding someone more advanced as a guide (ideally, an arhant).
- Today's world equivalents might be someone who has tried out a meditation app or read a related book.

### BRAIN MATCHING

**Brain Matching and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)**

* Dan wrote to Jon Kabat-Zinn suggesting research on MBSR's effectiveness in 1983.
* Dan and Richie proposed a soft measure for anxiety types: cognitive vs somatic.
* Jon studied which elements of MBSR work best for different types of anxiety.
* Ancient meditation traditions, such as the Visuddhimagga, emphasized matching students to methods.
* Modern approaches could use scientific measures like cognitive and emotional styles for optimal matching.
* Richie and Cortland Dahl proposed using existing measures and feedback from physiological responses.
* For those prone to ruminating and worrying: mindfulness of thoughts or yoga.
* For individuals with strong attention but low empathy: compassion practice.
* Future match-ups may be based on brain scans and personalized medicine approaches.

**Ancient Meditation Traditions and Matching Students to Methods**

* Visuddhimagga advised meditation teachers to observe students and assess their categories.
* Greedy types first notice beauty; uncomfortable lodgings, loathsome body parts as objects of meditation.
* Hateful types first notice wrongs; best food, comfortable rooms, soothing topics for meditation.

**Modern Approaches to Optimal Matching in Mindfulness Practices**

* Use scientific measures like cognitive and emotional styles for optimal matching.
* Feedback from physiological responses (e.g., sweat response) can help determine suitable practices.
* Richie and Cortland Dahl's proposed methods: mindfulness of thoughts, compassion practice.
* Future match-ups might be based on brain scans and personalized medicine approaches (precision medicine).

### WHAT’S MISSING?

**Historical Context of Meditation:**

* Meditation's original goal: Altered traits, not health or relaxation
* Contemplative practices require lifelong dedication
* Yogis practice in "deep" mode with spiritual tradition and ethical stance

**Components of Contemplative Practice:**

* Meditation is one part of a range of means to:
  + Increase self-awareness
  + Gain insights into consciousness
  + Achieve lasting transformation
* Other crucial elements often left behind in popular adaptations:
  + Ethical stance and moral guidelines
  + Altruistic intention for others' benefit
  + Grounded faith and personalized guidance
  + Devotion to the path, people, principles, or divine figures
  + Community and supportive culture

**Motivation and Progress:**

* Some modern practitioners may have different goals: Renewal or inner vacation
* Motivations can change with progress on the path

**Potential Impact of Overlooked Elements:**

* Scientific research documents altered traits, but we don't know how left-behind elements might contribute to these changes.

### AWAKENING

**Awakening and the Buddha:**
- Siddhartha Gautama completed his inner journey at Bodh Gaya and was asked if he was a god
- He replied "No. I am awake." (bodhi meaning "awake")
- This gave him the name Buddha, or The Awakened One
- Our understanding of what this awakening entailed is limited
- Advanced yogis may provide clues, such as high levels of ongoing gamma brain activity

**Benefits of Meditation:**
*Beginners:*
- Reduced amygdala reactivity to stress
- Improved attention: better focus, less mind-wandering, improved working memory
- Increased connectivity in empathy circuitry
- Decreased markers for inflammation

*Long-term meditators (1,000 hours or more):*
- Lowered reactivity to stress and lessened inflammation
- Strengthened prefrontal circuits for managing distress
- Lower levels of cortisol
- Greater neural attunement with those who are suffering
- Enhanced likelihood of helping others
- Stronger selective attention, decreased attentional blink, greater ease in sustaining attention
- Heightened readiness to respond and less mind-wandering
- Weakening of attachment circuitry
- Slower breath rate
- Enhanced immune system during daylong retreats
- Signs of meditative states continue during sleep
- Altered traits: large gamma waves in synchrony among far-flung brain regions, slower brain aging, ability to stop and start meditative states quickly, effortlessness in meditation, short pain reaction with rapid recovery, brains and hearts coupling during compassion meditation

**Science and Religion:**
- Science and religion represent disparate realms of authority, areas of inquiry, and ways of knowing
- Religion speaks to values, beliefs, and transcendence
- Science speaks to fact, hypotheses, and rationality
- We do not contend that science can referee metaphysical debates

**Pragmatic Approach:**
- In studying meditation, we aim for pragmatic benefits rather than truth-value of religious interpretations
- What processes of transformation from deep meditation can be extracted to benefit the widest population?
- Can mechanics of deep path create benefits for all?

## Chapter 14: A Healthy Mind

**Meditation and Mental Well-being: The Case of Healthy Minds**

* **Meditation in Healthcare:** Dr. Susan Davidson, a specialist in high-risk obstetrics and longtime meditator, organized a meditation group for doctors in her hospital, but attendance was low due to busy schedules.
* **The Need for Accessible Meditation:** With the increasing recognition of the benefits of meditation for mental well-being, there is a growing demand for accessible practices that can be integrated into people's daily lives.
* **Healthy Minds Digital Platform:** Richie Davidson and his team are developing Healthy Minds, a digital platform designed to teach meditation-based strategies for cultivating well-being even for those who say they have no time.
* **Tailored Meditation Practices:** Healthy Minds offers tailored practices that can be practiced during daily activities such as commuting or cleaning the house, allowing individuals to integrate meditation into their lives more easily.
* **Scientific Investigation:** The team plans to scientifically investigate the effectiveness of these piggybacked practices and answer practical questions about how different practice durations compare.
* **The Wider Reach of Contemplative Science:** Contemplative science has already led to various forms of mindfulness and meditation being made accessible to a wider audience, such as through corporate training programs and university offerings.
* **Innovative Applications:** Findings from contemplative science can lead to innovative applications that are evidence-based but do not resemble traditional meditation practices.
* **The Future of Contemplative Science:** As these methods become more distanced from their roots, it is important that they remain grounded in science and accessible to the widest possible audience for promoting mental, physical, and social well-being.

### GUIDING NEUROPLASTICITY

**Guiding Neuroplasticity through Early Childhood Education:**

* **Kindness Curriculum:** Laura Pinger, a curriculum specialist, developed this program to teach preschoolers the importance of kindness.
* **Mindfulness Exercises:** The Kindness Curriculum begins with age-appropriate mindfulness exercises like focusing on breathing and body awareness.
* **Empathy Development:** Children learn to focus their attention on others during upsets and imagine how they might feel, fostering empathy.
* **Encouraging Helping Behavior:** Children are encouraged to help each other and express gratitude.
* **Evaluation:** Studies show that children in the Kindness Curriculum shared more with those in need than standard pre-K students.

**The Importance of Kindness, Caring, and Compassion:**

* **Neglected Skills:** These vital capacities are often overlooked in the educational system.
* **Neuroplasticity:** Neuroplasticity tells us that brain circuitry can be guided in the best direction through training like the Kindness Curriculum.

**Attention and Self-Regulation:**

* **Importance of Attention:** No attention, nothing is learned.
* **Childhood Opportunity:** Childhood offers a long period of opportunity for growth in brain circuitry related to attention and self-regulation.
* **Urgent Need:** Society suffers from an attention deficit due to constant distractions from digital devices.

**Mindfulness and Education:**

* **Social/Emotional Learning (SEL):** Dan, a cofounder of SEL, argues for the importance of boosting attention and empathic concern.
* **Isolated Efforts:** While some schools have brought mindfulness to poor or troubled youth, it is not yet a standard offering for all children.
* **Gaming as a Tool:** Video games can be harnessed for good in cultivating wholesome states and traits like attention and empathy.

**Tenacity: A Mindfulness Video Game:**

* **Research-Based Game:** Tenacity is based on research from Richie's lab on breath counting and mind wandering.
* **Game Mechanic:** The core game mechanic involves tapping the iPad with one finger on each in-breath and with two fingers every fifth breath to track focused attention.
* **Beneficial Effects:** Playing Tenacity for 20-30 minutes daily over two weeks increased connectivity between the brain's executive center and circuitry for focused attention, as well as signs of increased empathy.

### THE MENTAL GYM

**Mental Gym and Neuroplasticity**
- Intriguing question: What if we could exercise our minds like we exercise our bodies? (Richie's lecture at National Institutes of Health)
- Unintentional mental diet leads to haphazard brain changes through daily activities, including digital device usage
- Neuroplasticity is the shaping of the brain by repeated experiences, affecting brain circuitry

**Contemplative Science and Intentional Mind Care**
- Contemplative science suggests taking responsibility for mental fitness
- Benefits of intentional mind care: improved executive function (MAP Training study)

**Challenges and Opportunities with Digital Delivery Systems**
- Mental gym concept as a set of apps for inner exercises
- Meditation apps widely used but lack rigorous scientific evaluation
- Success stories: web-based loving-kindness instruction, Mindful Mood Balance (MBCT)

**Empirical Questions and the Future of Digital Mind Training**
- Evaluating efficacy of different digital mind training programs
- Standardizing scientific evaluations for meditation apps
- Envisioning a culture that treats the mind like a muscle with daily care exercises.

### NEURAL HACKING

**Neural Hacking:** 
*A gathering of various disciplines to explore the mind's relationship with everyday desires, cravings, and addiction.*
- **March Morning:** The setting for the discussion in a Victorian house on the Amherst College campus.
- **Mind and Life Institute:** An organization that brought together religious scholars, experimental psychologists, neuroscientists, and philosophers.

**The Problem of Grasping:**
- Begins with everyday desire, can lead to craving and addiction.
- Religious scholars pinpointed the problem at the moment of grasping, the emotional impulse that makes us lean in towards pleasure.
- Impulse is driven by uneasiness and seductive mental whispers promising relief from disease.
- Moments of grasping can be subtle and unnoticed due to distractions.
- Addicts are likely to seek the next fix with small prompts that flood them with memories of their last fix.

**Mindfulness:**
- Helps observe impulses arising without being carried away by them.
- Impulses to grab start to stand out when mindful.
- Mindfulness quiets the PCC, a region associated with distraction, self-referential thinking, and craving.

**Postcingulate Cortex (PCC):**
- A neural area involved in being distracted, letting the mind wander, thinking about ourselves, liking a choice we've made even if it's immoral, feeling guilty, and craving.
- Mindfulness research has shown that it quiets the PCC, making mindfulness more effortless.

**Neurofeedback:**
- A technique that monitors brain activity and provides instant feedback to help people learn to control specific brain regions.
- Brewer uses neurofeedback to make the PCC less active, helping people addicted to cigarettes kick the habit.
- Can be used to monitor other neural processes and develop targeted meditation-derived apps.

**Possible Applications of Neurofeedback:**
- Reducing anxiety in mice using gamma frequency photic driving.
- Potential for slowing or reversing Alzheimer's disease with gamma wave neurofeedback, although human trials have not been conducted.
- Making once rarefied states more accessible to a wider audience through meditation-derived apps.

**Caveats:**
- Temporary state effects, not lasting traits.
- A huge divide between years of intensive meditation and using new apps for a short time.
- Neurofeedback is not a shortcut to the realization of altered traits gained through contemplative practice.
