* Avoid self-plagiarism (duplicate publication).

### Types of Articles and Papers

**Types of Articles and Papers**
* **Scientific journals**: publish various types of articles reporting primary research, theoretical advancements, or methodological developments.
* **Primary research articles**: quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods empirical studies that have not been previously published.
* **Theoretical articles**: describe advancements in theories without presenting original data.
* **Methodological articles**: discuss advancements in research methods.
* **Literature reviews** and meta-analyses**: summarize findings from primary research.
* **Student papers**: course assignments, dissertations, theses not intended for publication in a journal.

**Quantitative Articles**
* **Description**: report original, empirical quantitative research.
* **Characteristics**: numerically represented outcomes, analyzed using statistics and data analyses.
* **Structure**: Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion.
* **Sections**: Purpose, Background Literature, Hypotheses, Description of Study Procedures, Data Analysis, Findings Interpretation, Limitations & Implications.
* **Additional sections for multiple studies**: headings like "Experiment 1," "Results and Discussion," and a comprehensive general discussion at the end.

**Quantitative Research**
* **Approach**: commonly used in behavioral and social sciences to represent outcomes numerically.
* **Features**: uses experimental designs, data analyses, modeling techniques, statistical methods.
* **Study components**: materials, procedures, research design, ethical considerations, participant flow description.

**Reporting Standards**
* **Authors**: describe elements in first person.
* **Follow**: quantitative journal article reporting standards (Sections 5.1-12).

### Qualitative Articles

**Qualitative Research**
* **Qualitative Articles**: report original, empirical research using qualitative approaches.
* **Characteristics**: analyze data consisting of natural language, observations, and expressions; iterative process of analysis; reflexivity about researchers' perspectives; focus on experiences with shifting meaning.

**Qualitative Research Methods**
* **Case Studies**: reporting analyses or observations of an individual, group, community, or organization; illustrate a problem, provide solutions, or shed light on research needs.
* **Other Qualitative Research**: studying commonalities and differences across multiple participants, groups, communities, or organizations; focus on social processes, actions, or discourses.

**Qualitative Article Structure**
* Illustrative material vs confidential participant data: authors should balance the two responsibly (see Sections 1.1-1.19).
* Organization: thematic or chronological presentation; reflexive, first-person style detailing researchers' methods and findings.

**Qualitative Research Reporting Standards**
* Authors should adhere to reporting standards (see Sections .17 for more information).

**Characteristics of Qualitative Research**
* **Data Collection**: generates knowledge about human experience and action through non-numerical data.
* **Analysis Methods**: iterative process of self-correcting analysis; reflexivity about researchers' perspectives.
* **Findings**: situated within place and time, evolving meaning rather than seeking stable laws.

### Mixed Methods Articles

**Mixed Methods Articles**

**Structure of Mixed Methods Articles** varies based on study nature and balance between methodologies

**Replication Articles**
- *Replication studies*: verifying or reproducing previous findings
- **Internal vs. external replications**: this text focuses on external replications
- **External replication**: obtaining new sample to duplicate original study features as much as possible
  * Direct/exact replication: identical procedures or closely duplicated (e.g., location, investigators)
  * Approximate/modified replication: additional procedures and conditions
  * Conceptual replication: different techniques and manipulations for theoretical information (no features retained from initial study)
- Report sufficient information to determine type of replication

**Replication Types**
- **Direct/exact**: repeat study with identical or closely duplicated procedures
- **Approximate/modified**: additional procedures and conditions to determine influence on outcome
- **Conceptual**: different techniques and manipulations for theoretical insights, no features retained from initial study.

### Additional Data-Sharing Considerations for Qualitative Research

**Data Sharing Considerations for Qualitative Research**

**Distinct Issues from Section 1.14**
+ Consensus on data sharing yet to be reached.
+ Concerns about presenting raw data, confidentiality, consent, and researchers' perspectives.

**Raw Data in Research Reports**
+ Exemplify analysis process and demonstrate findings grounding.
+ Provide basis for evaluation of conclusions by readers, editors, peers.

**Confidentiality Limitations**
+ Protect participants' identities and meaningful information.
+ High burden on researchers to remove revealing details may compromise data.
+ Withhold data instead of stripping it of meaning.
+ Difficulties maintaining confidentiality with extensive data sets.

**Consent Limitations**
+ Participants might not consent to data sharing beyond initial research team.
+ Vulnerable populations and unique communities may have specific concerns.
+ Communities may own or co-own the data themselves, refusing to share.

**Researchers' Perspective Limitations**
+ Researchers' history and epistemological perspectives are legitimate influences on inquiry.
+ Interpretive attitudes, personal experiences, research teams, and analytic lenses enrich research.
+ Editors or external researchers may not share the same perspective.
+ Approach to investigation may signify epistemological commitments of researchers and participants.

**Recommendations for Data Sharing in Qualitative Research**
+ Elaborate on investigative attitudes, personal experiences, research teams, or analytic lenses when sharing data.
+ Clearly articulate purpose and rationale for data review prior to sharing.
+ Be aware of distinct epistemological positions and analytic processes within qualitative research.
+ Ensure that all stakeholders (researchers, participants, and communities) are involved in the decision-making process regarding data sharing.

### Duplicate and Piecemeal Publication of Data

**Duplicate and Piecemeal Publication in Research**
* **Accurate representation**: research efforts must be independent.
* **Duplicate publication**: publishing same data or ideas in multiple works.
* **Piecemeal publication**: splitting findings into multiple works unnecessarily.
* **Ethics Code (APA)**: prohibits duplicate publication of data.
* **Misrepresentation**: misleading about originality of research.
* **Consequences**: distorts knowledge base, wastes resources, copyright violations.

**Duplicate Publication**
* Prohibited by APA Ethics Code (Standard .1).
* Misleads readers about available information.
* Wastes resources: pages, editor and reviewer time.
* Can lead to incorrect conclusions.
* Copyright issues: one copyright per publication.

**Submitting Manuscripts for Publication**
* Disclose online posting before submission.
* Previously published material exceptions: abstracted form, limited circulation, reanalysis, follow-up studies.

**Exceptions to Duplicate Publication Policy**
* **Abstracted form**: conference proceedings, narrow circulation.
* **Limited availability**: university reports, government documents, dissertations.
* **Reanalysis**: new theories or methodologies, clearly labeled, provides new insights.
* **Follow-up studies**: initial findings then assessment at later date.

**Previously Published Material and Peer Review**
* Consult a journal editor to determine if re-publication is necessary.

### Acknowledging and Citing Previous Work. Authors sometimes want to publish what is essentially the same material in more than one venue to reach differ

**Duplicate Publication**
* **Acknowledging Previously Published Work**: essential to cite and acknowledge in new publications.
  * Inform editors, reviewers, readers, copyright holders.
  * Reporting new analyses or following up on previous work.
* **Conditions for Duplicate Publication**
  1. Small amount of duplicated material.
  2. Clear acknowledgment and citation in the article and author note.
  3. Copyright attribution for reprinted tables and figures.
  4. Permission from copyright holder.
* **Multiple Authors**: all original authors must provide permission and receive credit.

**Piecemeal Publication**
* **Overview**: present work parsimoniously, avoid fragmented publication.
* **Risks of Piecemeal Publication**
  * Misleading communication.
  * Distortion of scientific literature in reviews or meta-analyses.
* **Acceptable Reasons for Piecemeal Publication**
  * Clear reason for doing so.
  * Space constraints.

* **Editorial Judgment**
  * Determining if publication is fragmented or not.

### Multiple Publications From Large-Scale, Longitudinal Projects and Qualitative and Mixed Methods Research.

**Multiple Publications from Large-Scale, Longitudinal Projects and Qualitative Research**

**Situations Calling for Multiple Publications**
* **Multidisciplinary projects**: addressing diverse topics, answering different questions.
* **Distinct theoretical questions**: using same instruments, making unique contributions.
* **Longitudinal or large-scale studies**: data at different time points make independent scientific contributions.
* **Qualitative and mixed methods research**: voluminous findings not appropriate for a single article.

**Planning for Multiple Publications**
* Decide at the outset how data will be presented (one report vs. multiple reports).
* New questions or analyses should not be the sole reason for additional studies.
* Unique introduction, Results, Discussion, and Method sections for each report.

**Benefits of Multiple Publications**
* **Useful knowledge**: made available to others as soon as possible.
* **Flexibility**: addressing diverse topics or theoretical questions.
* **Comprehensive understanding**: deeper exploration of data in separate publications.

**Considerations for Multiple Publications**
* Ensure each publication makes a unique contribution and does not overlap significantly with previous work.
* Maintain transparency by clearly stating the relationship between the studies in each publication's introduction and acknowledgments sections.
* Be mindful of potential implications for citation counts, impact factors, and overall research output metrics.

### With mixed methods studies, authors might publish multiple articles, such as a qualitative study, a quantitative study, and a mixed methods overview s

**Mixed Methods Studies**
* Authors may publish multiple articles based on new insights from different methods.
* Cite prior reports to help readers understand the work.
* Distinguish between complete and incomplete data sets.
* Provide sufficient information for evaluation.
* Clarify sample overlap.
* Inform journal editor before submission.
* Manuscript may be rejected for piecemeal publication.

**Republication of Articles as Book Chapters**
* Authors must reveal previous publication and cite sources.
* Obtain permission to reprint or adapt work with proper attribution.
* Applicable to sections 12.14 and 12.1 of APA style.

**Plagiarism vs Self-plagiarism**

**Plagiarism:**
* Presenting others' words, ideas, or images as one's own.
* Violates ethical standards (APA Ethics Code Standard .11).
* Real-world consequences: rejection, professional sanctions, academic penalties.

**Self-plagiarism:**
* Presenting previously published work as original.
* Misleads readers and inflates publication count.
* Unethical and has real-world consequences.

**Citing Previous Work in Mixed Methods Studies**
* Cite prior reports to help readers understand the research accurately.
* Provide sufficient information for evaluation.
* Clarify sample overlap.
* Inform journal editor of similar manuscripts before submission.

**Consequences of Plagiarism and Self-plagiarism**
* Publication rejection.
* Professional sanctions, including censure, exclusion from funding opportunities.

### Organisation

**Organizational Principles in Scholarly Writing**

**1. Importance of Organizational Structure**
* Clear, precise, and logical communication.
* Consider best length and structure for findings.
* Order thoughts at sentence and paragraph levels.

**2. Use of Headings**

**Principles of Organization: Headings**
* **Clear and Concise**: help readers navigate content.
* **Consistent Formatting**: same level for topics of equal importance.
* Avoid having only one subsection heading within a section.

**APA Style Headings**

**Heading Levels**
* Five possible levels: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
* Top-down progression: highest level first, even if fewer subheadings in a section.

**Level of Headings**
| Level | Format |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Centered Bold Title Case Heading Text begins as a new paragraph |
| 2 | Flush Left Bold Title Case Heading Text begins as a new paragraph |
| 3 | Flush Left Bold Italic Title Case Heading Text begins as a new paragraph |
| 4 | Indented Bold Title Case Heading Ending With a Period Text begins on the same line and continues as a regular paragraph |
| 5 | Indented Bold Italic Title Case Heading Ending With a Period Text begins on the same line and continues as a regular paragraph |

**Headings in an Introduction**
* No "Introduction" heading needed.
* Use Level 2, 3 headings (and so on) for subsections within the introduction.

**Number of Headings in a Paper**
* Depends on length and complexity.
* Use only necessary to differentiate sections.
* No labeling with numbers or letters.

  - Analytic methods explanation and justification
  - Researcher background and beliefs disclosure
  - Raw data transformation into findings
- *Flexibility in length*: accommodations should be made for comprehensive reporting.
- *Communication with editors*: collaborate on finding a suitable solution when facing page limits.

## Writing Style and Grammar

**Effective Scholarly Writing**
* **Four Qualities**: Continuity, flow, conciseness, and clarity.
* **Guidance**: Techniques and principles for effective scholarly writing (Sections 4.1 to 4.11).

**General Rules for Grammar and Usage**
* Follow standard rules for grammar and usage to improve your writing.

**Suggested Strategies for Improving Your Writing**
* Read widely and often.
* Write frequently and practice editing.
* Get feedback from peers and instructors.

### Continuity and Flow

**Effective Writing: Continuity and Flow**
* Characteristics of effective writing: continuity, logical consistency; flow, smooth cadence.
* Lack of continuity and flow can make arguments seem less credible, disorganized or confusing.
* Readers will better understand ideas if presented logically with clear relationships.

**Improving Continuity and Flow**
* Check transitions between sentences, paragraphs, and ideas:
  + Ensure text is smooth and clear rather than abrupt or disjointed.
  + Use additional transitional devices to make it less choppy.
* Use punctuation marks appropriately for meaning and relationships.
* Avoid overusing or underusing one type of punctuation.
* Transitional words and phrases: time links, cause effect links, addition links, contrast links.
* Adverbs as introductory or transitional words should be used judiciously.

**Noun Strings**
* Noun strings: multiple nouns placed one after another to modify a final noun can confuse readers.
* Untangle noun strings by moving the final noun earlier and showing relationships with verbs or prepositions.
* Examples:
  + skinfold test body fat percentage -> a caliper examination to determine body fat percentage
  + preliminary online collegiate instructional methods survey results -> preliminary results of an online survey of collegiate instructional methods.

### Importance of Conciseness and Clarity

**Importance of Conciseness and Clarity in Writing**
* **Concise writing**: more readable, increases chances of success.
* Avoid adding extraneous material or "fluff."
* If paper is too short, develop ideas further for substance.
* Eliminate wordiness, redundancy, evasiveness, and passive voice.
* Use clear language, define technical terms, be deliberate with word choice.
* Be consistent in usage of words and phrases.
* Avoid synonyms that may cause imprecision.
* Considerate in use of descriptive terms for people and avoid bias-free language.

**Wordiness and Redundancy**
* **Wordiness**: using more words than necessary.
* Avoid embellishments and flowery writing.
* Use sentence structure to convey emphasis instead.
* Use active voice to reduce wordiness and redundancy.
* **Redundancy**: using multiple words with the same meaning.
* Use active voice or sentence structure to convey emphasis.

**Examples of Wordy vs. Concise Language**
|Wordy |Concise|
|---|---|
|at the present time |now|
|for the purpose of |for, to|
|there were several students who completed |several students completed|

**Redundant Language**
* "they were both alike" -> "one and the same"
* "a sum total" -> "in close proximity to"
* "four different groups saw" -> "completely unanimous"
* "were exactly the same as" -> "positioned very close"
* "absolutely essential" -> "period of time"
* "has been previously found" -> "summarize briefly"
* "small in size" -> "the reason is because"

**Avoiding Wordiness and Redundancy**
* Use active voice.
* Omit redundant words.
* Use sentence structure to convey emphasis.

### Sentence and Paragraph Length

**APA Writing Style: Sentence and Paragraph Length**
- No specific minimum or maximum sentence length in APA style.
- Varyed sentence length maintains reader interest and comprehension.
- Avoid overuse of short, simple or long, complex sentences.
- Use logical sentence structures for complex concepts.
- Break down long sentences with multiple ideas into shorter ones.
- Paragraphs should be appropriate in length; single-sentence and excessively long paragraphs are to be avoided.

**APA Writing Style: Tone**
- Clear communication is essential.
- Devices used in creative writing (ambiguity, shifts in topic/tense) unsuitable for scientific writing.
- Focus on ideas and findings with a professional and compelling style.
- Write for a specific reader to improve understanding and appreciation.
- Avoid contractions and colloquialisms for a formal tone.
- Use precise, scholarly language instead of approximations and jargon.

**Sentence and Paragraph Length (continued)**
- Sentences should be clear and easy to follow.
- Long sentences are acceptable if complex ideas are presented logically.

**Tone (continued)**
- Write in a professional, noncombative manner when contrasting positions of different researchers.
- Use language that is formal and professional.

**Avoid Contractions and Colloquialisms**
- Use full forms instead of contractions for professional tone.
- Precise language and avoid approximations.
- Jargon hinders comprehension, use precise language instead.
- Ensure your writing is accessible to readers outside your field.

**Jargon**
- Specialized terminology may be unfamiliar to non-experts.
- Overuse of jargon impedes understanding and wastes space.
- Define any necessary jargon on first use.
- Avoid using euphemisms or bureaucratic jargon.

### Logical Comparisons

**Clear and Logical Comparisons**
- Ensure comparisons are expressed clearly: "Twelve-year-olds were more likely to play with age peers than -year-olds." -> "12-year-olds were more likely to play with their age peers than with those of other ages."
- Use parallel structure and clear key words.

**Avoiding Anthropomorphism**
- Do not attribute human characteristics to animals or inanimate objects: "Rat couples" is an example of anthropomorphism, use "pairs of rats" instead.
- Write with care when using comparisons and metaphors.
- Be aware that some constructions, like "this section addresses" or "the chapter focuses on," are acceptable.

**Communication Clarity**
- Use active verbs with human actors: "we extrapolated the rate of change."
- Determine what constitutes anthropomorphism based on understanding and potential misleading implications for readers.
- Keep clear communication as a priority when making word choices and sentence structures.

**Comparisons**
- Be precise in comparisons to avoid ambiguity: "Twelve-year-olds were more likely than -year-olds to play with age peers." -> "12-year-olds were more likely to play with their age peers and less likely to play with those of other ages."
- Use parallel structure to avoid ambiguous comparisons.

**Anthropomorphism Examples**
| Correct | Incorrect  | Rationale   |
|---|---|---|
| Pairs of rats (cage mates) were allowed to forage together. | Rat couples (cage mates) were allowed to forage together. | "Rat couples" implies a misleading parallel between human romantic couples and pairs of rats. |
| The theory addresses this issue. | The theory concludes this issue. | Researchers address issues, not theories themselves. |

**Acceptable Constructions**
- Some constructions are acceptable even if they appear anthropomorphic: "this section addresses," "the chapter focuses on."
- However, it's important to consider context and implications for readers.

### Grammar and Usage

**Grammar and Usage**
* **Verbs**
  * **Tenses**: past, present perfect, active voice, passive voice.
  * Use consistent verb tenses (Table 4.1).
  * Avoid sudden shifts in tense.
  * Past tense: for discussing other researchers' work.
  * Present perfect tense: for actions not at a specific time or continuing to the present.
* **Active and Passive Voice**
  * Active voice: subject + verb + object.
  * Passive voice: object + verb (past participle) + subject (optional).
  * Use active voice for clear, direct sentences.
  * Passive voice acceptable for focusing on the object or recipient of the action.
* **Mood**
  * Indicative mood: making factual statements.
  * Subjunctive mood: describing conditions contrary to fact.
  * Use "would" with care.
* **Subject and Verb Agreement**
  * A verb must agree in number with its subject.
  * Collective nouns: singular or plural based on context.
  * Compound subjects joined by "or" or "nor": the verb agrees with the closer subject.

**Verbs**
* **Tenses**: past, present perfect.
* Use consistent tenses in a paper.
* Past tense: for discussing other researchers' work.
* Present perfect: for actions not at a specific time or continuing to the present.

**Voice**
* **Active voice**: subjects come before verbs and objects.
* **Passive voice**: objects come before verbs and "by" + subject.
* Use active voice for clear, direct sentences.
* Passive voice acceptable when focusing on object or recipient of action.

**Mood**
* **Indicative mood**: expresses facts.
* **Subjunctive mood**: describes improbable or contrary-to-fact conditions.
* Use "would" with care: as a habit or in the conditional mood.

**Subject and Verb Agreement**
* A verb must agree in number with its subject, regardless of intervening phrases.
* Collective nouns: singular if the action applies to the group, plural if it applies to individuals.
* Compound subjects joined by "or" or "nor": the verb agrees with the closer subject.

**Table 4.1 - Verb Tenses in Various Parts of a Paper**
| Paper section | Recommended tense | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Literature review (discussing other researchers' work) | Past | Quinn (2020) presented... |
| Present perfect | Since then, many investigators have used... |
| Method | Past | Participants completed a survey... |
| Reporting of results | Past | Results were nonsignificant... |
| Discussion of implications of results | Present | The results indicate... |
| Presentation of conclusions, limitations, future directions | Present | We conclude... |

## Bias-Free Language Guidelines
### Pronouns

**Pronoun Usage in Research Writing**

**First- versus Third-Person Pronouns**
* **Clear attribution**: refer to yourself or coauthors clearly using first person for singular, third person for plural.
* Avoid third person when not referring to a specific author or contribution.

**Avoiding Ambiguity**
* Use "I" for single authorship.
* Use "we" for multiple authors.
* Use "they" as generic third-person pronoun or for individuals who use "they/them/their" pronouns.

**Editorial We**
* Avoid using editorial "we" to refer to yourself, coauthors, or general people in multiauthored papers.

**Singular They**
* Use "they," "them," "their," "theirs," and "themselves" for the singular third-person pronoun when referring to individuals whose gender is unknown or irrelevant.

**Avoiding Gender Bias**
* Rephrase sentences if the singular "they" seems awkward or distracting.
* Use plural nouns or plural pronouns instead of gendered pronouns.
* Replace the pronoun with an article when possible.
* Drop the pronoun in some cases.

**Examples of Correct Usage**
* "Each participant turned in their questionnaire."
* "Jamie shared their experiences as a genderqueer person."
* "A child should learn to play by themselves or themself as well as with friends."
* "Rowan, a transgender person, helped themselves or themself to the free coffee."

**Gender and Pronoun Usage (Section 5.5)**
* Use "he or she" and "she or he" sparingly and ensure matching pronouns.
* Avoid "s(he)" or "s he," instead use "they" or rewrite the sentence.

### Pronouns for People and Animals

**Pronouns for People and Animals**
- **Who**: human beings
- **That / Which**: nonhuman animals, inanimate objects
  * Use neuter pronouns for animals unless named and sex is known
- Correct usage:
  + Humans: "The students who completed the task"
  + Nonhumans/inanimate objects: "The instructions that were included"
- Incorrect usage:
  + Humans: "The students that completed the task"
  + Nonhumans/inanimate objects: "The participants whom passed the exam"

**Pronouns as Subjects and Objects**
* Relative pronouns can be subjects or objects of verbs or prepositions
* Use "who" as subject, "whom" as object
  + Test: Replace subordinate clause with personal pronoun to determine if who/whom is correct.
  + Example: Participants who passed the exam -> They passed the exam and were given course credit (Subject: they)
  + Incorrect example: Eligible participants, each of whom had a child under age 21 with cancer -> Eligible participants each of them had a child under age 21 with cancer (Subject: they)

**Pronouns in Restrictive and Nonrestrictive Clauses**
* **Who/Whom**: introduces subordinate clauses that are essential to the meaning of the sentence (restrictive clauses) or add further information but not essential (nonrestrictive clauses)
* Use "that" for restrictive clauses, "which" for nonrestrictive clauses
  + Restrictive clauses: no commas
    * Therapist self-disclosure that conflicts with the patient's story might hinder the therapeutic process (Only self-disclosure conflicting with the patient's story is problematic)
  + Nonrestrictive clauses: set off with commas
    * All interviews were conducted at participants' offices, which provided suitable privacy to secure participants' anonymity (Both interviews and offices provide suitable privacy)
* Consistent usage helps improve clarity and precision.

### Sentence Construction

**Subordinate Conjunctions**
* Introduce subordinate clauses: "since," "while," "although," "because," "whereas."
* Be precise with meaning to improve clarity.
* Use "while" for simultaneous events, "although," "despite," "and," or "but" otherwise.

**Subordinate Conjunctions vs. Other Words**
* "While": links simultaneous events. Use "although," "despite," "and," or "but" for other comparisons.
* "Since": can mean "from a time in the past" or "because." Use "because" when meaning is clear to avoid ambiguity.

**Modifiers**
* Misplaced modifiers: make it hard for readers to follow sentence logic by ambiguously or illogically modifying words.
* Place adjectives and adverbs as close as possible to the word they modify.

**Squinting Modifiers**
* Ambiguous placement makes it difficult to determine which phrase is being modified.
* Write in active voice to avoid dangling modifiers.

**Misplaced "Only"**
* Place "only" next to the word or phrase it modifies for clarity.

**Dangling Modifiers**
* Have no referent in the sentence, often due to passive voice.
* Write in active voice to avoid dangling modifiers.

**Examples of Corrected and Incorrect Sentences with Rationale**
| Correct | Incorrect | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Using this procedure, I tested the participants. | The participants were tested using this procedure. | I, not the participants, used the procedure. |
| Based on this assumption, we developed a model. | On the basis of this assumption, we developed a model. | The incorrect construction says, we are based on this assumption. |
| These data only provide a partial answer. | These data only provide a partial answer. | The answer is partial, not the providing of it. |
| My comprehension is improved when I read slowly. | Reading books slowly improves my comprehension. | It is unclear whether the reading or the improvement is slow. |
| Using this procedure, the investigator tested the participants. | The investigator tested the participants using this procedure. | The incorrect sentence is unclear about who used the procedure. |
| Participants were leaving since the light turned green. | Participants left because the light turned green. | "Since" was ambiguous and caused confusion, replace it with "because." |
| Armitage and Martine (2017) found that the treatment group performed better, a result congruent with those of other studies. | Congruent with other studies, Armitage and Martine (2017) found that the treatment group performed better. | The result, not Armitage and Martine, is congruent.

### Parallel Construction

**Parallel Construction in Writing**
* **Enhance understanding**: present parallel ideas in identical grammatical form (Section .49).
* **Parallel structure**: compound sentences, series, lists, table stubs (Section .7.12).

**Repetition of Parallel Elements**
* Ensure all elements of parallelism are present before and after the coordinating conjunction.
* Use same grammatical form for each part of parallelism.
* Do not use commas or semicolons before coordinating conjunctions when there are only two parts in a clause.

**Examples of Correct Usage**
* "Ford (2020) found that homework is positively related to achievement and that the association is stronger in middle and high school than in elementary school."
* "We recorded the difference between the performance of participants who completed the first task and those who completed the second task."
* "The names were difficult both to pronounce and to spell."
* "Neither the responses to the auditory stimuli nor the responses to the tactile stimuli were repeated."
* "The respondents either gave the worst answer or the best answer."
* "It is surprising not only that pencil-and-paper scores predicted this result but also that all other predictors were less accurate."
* "The participants were told to make themselves comfortable, to read the instructions, and to ask about anything they did not understand."

**Examples of Incorrect Usage**
* "Ford (2020) found that homework is positively related to achievement, and that the association is stronger in middle and high school than in elementary school."
* "We recorded the difference between the performance of participants who completed the first task and the second task."
* "between 2.5–4.0 years old" (incorrect use of en-dash)
* "The names were difficult both to pronounce as well as to spell." (avoid using "both" with "as well as")
* "Neither the responses to the auditory stimuli nor to the tactile stimuli were repeated." (correct, no need for "to" before "were repeated")
* "The respondents either gave the worst answer or the best answer."
* "It is not only surprising that pencil-and-paper scores predicted this result but also that all other predictors were less accurate." (avoid using "not only" with "but also" in this way)
* "The participants were told to make themselves comfortable, to read the instructions, and that they should ask about anything they did not understand." (incorrect use of comma before "and" in list)

**Series Elements**
* All elements in a series should be parallel in form.
* Correct: The participants were told to make themselves comfortable, to read the instructions, and to ask about anything they did not understand.
* Incorrect: The participants were told to make themselves comfortable, to read the instructions, and that they should ask about anything they did not understand. (incorrect use of comma before "and" in list)

- Inclusive terms: "participant" instead of "subject"
- Nonjudgmental language: "individuals from racial or ethnic minority backgrounds" instead of "minorities" or "ethnic groups"

**Conclusion:**
- Practice reading for biases
- Use respectful and precise terminology
- Contribute to accurate, unbiased communication.

### General Guidelines for Reducing Bias

**Bias-Free Writing Guidelines**

**1. Precise and Accurate Language**
- Describe people accurately and clearly
- Avoid bias or prejudicial connotations
- Choose terms that are free from imprecision

**2. Focus on Relevant Characteristics**
- Describe only relevant characteristics
- Include only necessary information
- Discuss intersection of multiple relevant characteristics, as appropriate

**3. Acknowledge Existing Differences**
- Recognize and acknowledge differences when they exist
- Evaluate meaning of "difference" carefully
- Report differences between sample and target population

**4. Be Appropriately Specific**
- Choose terms that are appropriately specific
- Consider level of specificity early in research process
- Use exact ages or age ranges for age
- Use names of conditions for disability
- Use descriptors with modifiers for gender identity
- Use terms indicating research context for participants
- Use nation or region of origin for racial/ethnic groups
- Use names of orientations for sexual orientation
- Use income ranges or specific designations for socioeconomic status.

**Examples of Specific Language**
- Age: exact ages or age ranges, include mean and median
- Disability: names of conditions
- Gender Identity: descriptors with modifiers (cisgender women, transgender women)
- Participants: terms that indicate research context (patients, participants, clients)
- Racial/Ethnic Groups: nation or region of origin (Chinese Americans, Mexican Americans)
- Sexual Orientation: names of orientations (lesbians, gay men, bisexual people, straight people)
- Socioeconomic Status: income ranges or specific designations (below the federal poverty threshold for a family of four).

### Be Sensitive to Labels

**Use of Labels and Language**

**Be Sensitive to Labels:**
- Call people what they call themselves
- Determine appropriate labels for research
- Consult self-advocacy groups or participants
- Be cautious with stigmatizing language

**Acknowledge People's Humanity:**
- Use labels with respect for individuality and humanity
- Avoid using labels as nouns or equating people with their conditions
- Use clear, appropriate operational group labels

**Provide Operational Definitions and Labels:**
- Provide definitions of groups in research papers
- Use descriptive and clear operational group labels
- Avoid false hierarchies and biased comparisons

**Be Aware of Social Implications:**
- Consider the order and presentation of social groups in research
- Avoid implying dominance or normality of certain groups

**Language and Labels for People with Disabilities:**
- Use preferred labels, such as "Deaf" capitalized or person-first/identity-first language depending on the community
- Provide operational definitions and clear group labels
- Avoid false hierarchies and biased comparisons

**Additional Considerations:**
- Determine appropriate labels for research based on groups' preferences and debates within the community
- Use adjectival forms instead of nouns to label people
- Be sensitive to changing language and terminology over time.

### Reducing Bias by Topic

**Writing about Age in Research: Guidelines**

**Reporting Age in Method Section**
- Report age as part of participant description
- Be specific: ranges, means, medians
- Avoid open-ended definitions

**Terms for Different Age Groups**

**Younger Ages:**
- Infant: very young child
- Child: individual under 12 years
- Adolescent: individual aged 1 to 17 years
- Girl, Boy, Transgender girl, Transgender boy, etc.
- Agender adolescent, Gender-fluid child, etc.
- Appropriate terms: person, individual

**Older Ages:**

**General Guidance:**
- Older adults are a subgroup of adults
- Be specific: age ranges, means, medians
- Preferred terms: older persons, older people, older adults, older patients, etc.
- Avoid stigmatizing terms: seniors, elderly, aging dependents, etc.
- Use dementia instead of "senility"
- Specify type of dementia when known
- Aging is a normal part of human experience
- Gerontologists may use combination terms (young-old, old-old)

**Terms for Older Adults:**
- Older adults: 5 years and older
- Young-old: specific age range (e.g., 60-74 years)
- Old-old: specific age range (e.g., 75+ years)
- Oldest old: specific age range (e.g., 85+ years)

**Contrasting Older Adults with Other Age Groups:**
- Be specific when contrasting older adults with other age groups (young adults, middle-aged adults)
- Use decade-specific descriptors if desired (octogenarian, centenarian)
- Avoid generational descriptors (baby boomers, Gen X, millennials, etc.) unless related to the study topic.

### Disability

**Disability and Disability Language**
- Broad term for physical, psychological, intellectual, and socioemotional impairments (World Health Organization)
- Preferred terms for specific disabilities vary among disability groups
- Honoring group's language choices shows respect and solidarity

**Types of Disability Language**

**Person-First Language:**
- Emphasizes the person, not the condition
- Example: "person with paraplegia"
- Applies to groups as well: "people with substance use disorders"

**Identity-First Language:**
- Focuses on disability as part of identity
- Example: "blind person"
- Expression of cultural pride and reclamation of identity
- More likely preferred by those who embrace disability as part of their identity

**Choosing Between Person-First and Identity-First Language:**
- Both approaches respect disabled persons
- Seek guidance from self-advocacy groups or stakeholders specific to a group
- Use participants' self-described language when working directly with them.

### Relevance of Mentioning a Disability

**Disability**
- **Relevance**: mention disability when necessary and relevant
- **Specificity**: different types and levels of disabilities within groups should be articulated
- **Negative terminology**: avoid pictorial metaphors, negativistic terms, slurs

**Gender and Sex**
- **Gender**: attitudes, feelings, behaviors associated with biological sex; social construct and identity
- **Reporting**: use precise language to describe gender identities of participants
- **Sex**: biological sex assignment
- **Distinction between gender and sex**: both may be relevant in certain studies
- **Gender identity**: deeply felt sense of being a particular gender
- **Reporting of gender identity**: explicitly designate information about participants' gender identities
- **Cisgender**: sex assigned at birth aligns with gender identity
- **Transgender and gender-nonconforming people**: individuals whose gender identity, expression, or role does not conform to cultural associations with their sex assigned at birth
- Prejudice and negativity towards transgender and gender-nonconforming people

**Terminology**
- Use terms preferred by individuals
- Avoid ambiguity over "sex" meaning sexual behavior
- Gender identity is distinct from sexual orientation.

**Additional Considerations**
- Include definitions and explanations of terms for clarity
- Be aware of the evolution of language related to gender and sex
- Use identity labels that align with individuals' stated identities

### Sex Assignment

**Language and Terminology**

**Avoid Disparaging Terms:**
- "birth sex," "natal sex," "tranny," "transvestite"
- Use "assigned sex" or "sex assigned at birth" instead

**Appropriate Use of Gender Terms:**
- Use name given by individuals to refer to themselves
- Use specific nouns (e.g., women, men, transgender men, etc.)
- Use "male" and "female" as adjectives, not as nouns
- Use inclusive terms like "individuals," "people," or "persons"
- Avoid gendered endings in occupational titles

**Pronoun Usage:**
- Do not refer to identified pronouns as "preferred pronouns"
- Use specific pronouns for known individuals
- Singular "they" when gender is irrelevant or unknown
- Avoid sexist bias in pronoun usage
- Avoid using combinations of "he or she," "she or he," etc.

**Terms That Imply Binaries:**
- Do not use "opposite sex" or "opposite gender"
- Use "another sex" or "another gender" instead
- Use "mixed gender" or "mixed sex" for relationships with different genders or sexes
- Use "same gender" or "same sex" for relationships with the same gender or sex

**Additional Considerations:**
- Respect confidentiality when referring to individuals
- Use accurate and inclusive language in research and publications.

### Participation in Research

**Participation in Research**
- People participate in research in various settings: labs, homes, schools, businesses, clinics, hospitals
- Descriptive terms: "college students," "children," "respondents," "participants," "subjects," "patients," or other terms
- Specific terms for statistical contexts: "subjects" and "sample"
- In health care setting, use "patient"
- Respect individual and cultural preferences when choosing language

**Differences between Terms**
- Case vs. person: differentiate between disorder/illness and the person affected by it (e.g., "people with bipolar disorder were treated" instead of "manic depressive cases were treated")
- Avoid terms like "patient management," "patient placement"; use alternatives such as "coordination of care," "supportive services," "assistance"
- Use precise and clear language for broad clinical terms (e.g., "borderline" or "at risk"); specify context and meaning
- Use active voice to acknowledge participants' contributions

**Terminology**
- Avoid using "failed" when describing research results; use more neutral language like "did not complete"
- Write about people in a respectful and acknowledging way.

- Intersectionality: a paradigm addressing multiple dimensions of identity and social systems
- Individuals shaped by cultural, structural, sociobiological, economic, and social contexts

**Intersectionality:**
- Addresses multiple dimensions of identity and social systems
- Inequality related to racism, genderism, heterosexism, ageism, classism, etc.
- Individuals located within various social groups and their structural inequalities
- Unique identities based on individual experiences and social locations

**Intersectional Identities:**

- Identify relevant characteristics and group memberships (race, gender, class, etc.)
- Describe how characteristics intersect in a study's context
- Report participant data using specific terms
- Note the impact of intersections on findings instead of assuming one characteristic is responsible.

**Intersectionality Key Concepts:**
- Cultural: beliefs, values, practices, and symbols that shape individuals’ experiences
- Structural: social structures, institutions, and power relationships
- Sociobiological: biological characteristics and their interaction with social systems
- Economic: resources and material conditions
- Social contexts: family, peer groups, schools, workplaces, etc.

## Style

**Style and Writing Guidelines**
- Style+ refers to guidelines for clear, consistent communication in written works
- APA Style provides scholarly writing guidelines for publications and academic papers
- Avoids inconsistencies among and within journal articles and academic papers
- Covers punctuation, spelling, capitalization, italics, abbreviations, numbers, statistical copy, and lists

**Punctuation**
- Establishes the cadence of a sentence (commas, semicolons, colons, periods, dashes, parentheses, square brackets)
- Determines pauses in thought (length and kind)

**Spacing After Punctuation Marks**
- One space after periods or other punctuation marks at the end of a sentence
- No space in specific cases: internal periods in abbreviations, colons in ratios, identity-concealing labels for study participants

**Period Use**
- End complete sentences
- With initials in names

**Abbreviations**

**Requiring Periods**
- US, UK as adjectives
- Identity-concealing labels for study participants
- Latin abbreviations
- Reference abbreviations

**Note:** Follow publisher or instructor's guidelines if different.

### Comma Usage

**Comma Usage**
* Use a comma:
	+ Between elements in a series of three or more items (serial comma or Oxford comma) e.g., height, width, and depth
	+ After an introductory phrase if it's short: e.g., After the nurses administered the medication, patients rated their pain.
	+ To set off a nonessential or nonrestrictive clause: e.g., Strong fearful faces, **which are rarely seen in everyday life**, convey intense expression of negative emotions.
	+ To set off statistics: e.g., Sleep amount was not significantly different between the three groups (nap M 7.48 hr, SD 1.99, wake M 8.13 hr, SD 1.22, nap wake M 7.25 hr, SD 0.76), F(2, 71) 2.32, p .11.
	+ To separate groups of three digits in most numbers: e.g., 7 years 4 months 2 min 35 s 5 ft 10 in.
	+ To separate two independent clauses with conjunctive adverbs: e.g., The children studied the vocabulary words **however**, they had difficulties with recall.
	+ To separate items in a list that already contain commas: e.g., The color groups were red, yellow, and blue, orange, green, and purple or black, gray, and brown.
	+ To separate multiple parenthetical citations: e.g., (Gaddis, 2018 Lai et al., 2016 Williams Peng, 2019)
	+ To separate different types of information in the same set of parentheses: e.g., n 33 (Fu Ginsburg, 2020).
	+ To separate sets of statistics that already contain commas: e.g., age, M 34.5 years, 95 CI 29.4, 39.6 years of education, M 10.4 8.7, 12.1 and weekly income, M $612 $522, $702.
* Do not use a comma:
	+ Before an essential or restrictive clause: e.g., Adolescents who spent a small amount of time on electronic communication activities were happier than those who spent no time on such activities.
	+ Between the two parts of a compound predicate: e.g., Participants rated the items and completed a demographic questionnaire.
	+ Retrieved (exact dates) or in (months and years): e.g., Retrieved April 24, 2020, from or in April 2020.
	+ In the following cases: because removing these would alter the intended meaning: e.g., because removing such a clause from the sentence would alter the intended meaning.
* Use a semicolon:
	+ To separate two independent clauses that are not joined by a conjunction: e.g., Students received course credit for participation; community members received 10.
	+ To separate items in a list that already contain semicolons: e.g., The color groups were red, yellow, and blue; orange, green, and purple or black, gray, and brown.

### Colon

**Colon Usage**
- Colon used after grammatically complete introductory clause
  * Introductory clause can stand alone as a sentence
  * Illustrates, extends, or amplifies thought following colon
  * Capital letter required if it's a complete sentence

- Colon not used after incomplete introduction

**Quotation Marks**
- Quotation marks used for:
  * Linguistic examples or as themselves
  * Letters, words, phrases, or sentences
  * Stimuli in text (alternatively, use italics)

  * Periodical article or book chapter titles in text and copyright attributions
- Quotation marks not used for:
  * Key terms or phrases (use italics instead)
  * Anchors of a scale
  * Numerals when meaning clear without quotation marks.

**Dashes**
- Two types of dashes in APA Style: em dash and en dash
- Em dash: set off an element for amplification or digression
  * No space before or after
  * Overuse weakens flow
- En dash: between words of equal weight, numerical ranges
  * No space before or after
  * Word processors can insert automatically.

**Miscellaneous**

### Parentheses

**Use of Parentheses**
* Set off structurally independent elements: (e.g., statistically significant (see Figure 5))
* Set off in-text citations: (Barnes and Spreiter 2019) described (Proctor Hoffmann 2016)
* Introduce abbreviations: (see also Section .25), galvanic skin response (GSR), Child Report of Parental Behavior Inventory (CRPBI Schaefer 1965)
* Set off letters that identify items in a list: (a) synonyms associated with cultural interactions, (b) descriptors for ethnic group membership, and (c) psychological symptoms and outcomes associated with bicultural adaptation
* Group mathematical expressions: (k – 1) (g – 2)
* Enclose numbers that identify displayed formulas and equations: (to enclose statistical values that do not already contain parentheses was statistically significant p .031)
* Note: If a complete sentence is in parentheses, place the end punctuation inside the parentheses.

**Use of Square Brackets**
* Enclose parenthetical material that is already in parentheses: (The results for the control group n 8 are also presented in Figure 2.)
* Enclose abbreviations when the abbreviated term appears in parentheses: Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory–2 MMPI-2 Butcher et al., 2001
* Enclose values that are the limits of a confidence interval: 95 CIs –7.2, 4.3, 9.2, 12.4, and –1.2, –0.5
* Enclose material inserted in a quotation by someone other than the original author: (Schofield et al. 2016 found that these types of warm and accepting parenting behaviors are positively associated with healthy child and adolescent adjustment (p. 615).)
* In mathematical material, the placement of brackets and parentheses is reversed
* Around the year in a narrative citation when the sentence containing the narrative citation appears in parentheses: (as Gregory, 2020, concluded . . . )

**Misuse of Parentheses and Square Brackets**
* Avoid nested parentheses, use square brackets instead: (e.g., flow Csiks entmihalyi, 2014)
* Do not enclose statistics that already include parentheses in parentheses: in the first study, F(1, 32) 4.37, p .045

**Placement of Punctuation**
* Place end punctuation inside parentheses if the entire sentence is in parentheses
* Place punctuation outside parentheses if only part of the sentence is in parentheses

### Slash

**Slash Usage**

  * Compound adjectives: clarify comparison, hyphenated compounds
  * Classification and judgment condition
  * Test reliability: test-retest
  * Specifying possibilities: and or
  * Separating numerator from denominator
  * Units of measurement with numeric values
  - Do not use slash for:
    * Compound units: use dots and parentheses
    * Phrases instead of slashes

**Spelling in APA Style**
- Use Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary for base words, APA Dictionary of Psychology for psychological terms
- Plural forms of Latin/Greek origin: appendices, criteria, curricula, data, phenomena

**Singular and Plural Nouns**
- Singular: appendix, criterion, curriculum, datum, phenomenon
- Plural: appendices, criteria, curricula, data, phenomena

**Possessive Forms of Names**
- Add an apostrophe and "s" for singular or names ending in "s"

### Hyphenation

**Compound Words and Hyphenation**

**Introduction:**
- Compound words can be written as separate words, hyphenated, or solid
- Permanent compounds are established in the dictionary and should be written according to its listing
- Temporary compounds are created for specific uses and should be hyphenated for clarity when necessary

**Permanent Compounds:**
- Can be found in dictionaries
- Follow the dictionary's hyphenation guidelines
- Examples: "health care," "self-esteem," "caregiver"

**Temporary Compounds:**
- Not listed in the dictionary
- Follow these guidelines for hyphenation:
  * If misreading is possible or expresses a single thought, use a hyphen
  * If clear without a hyphen, do not use one

**Hyphen Guidelines for Temporary Compounds:**
- Before the noun it modifies: "decision-making behavior," "water-deprived animals"
- After the term it modifies: "behavior related to decision making," "students in the 12th grade"
- With adverbs and comparative/superlative adjectives: "widely used test," "higher order learning"
- With numbers, letters, or fractions: "six-trial problem," "Type II error," "one third of the participants"
- With prefixes and suffixes: see Tables 2 and 3 for examples

**Prefixes and Suffixes That Do Not Require Hyphens:**
- Examples: "retrievable," "intercede," "covariate," "nanometer," etc. (See Table 2)

**Exceptional Cases:**
- Words with a capitalized base word: "pro-Freudian"
- Compounds with numbers or abbreviations: "post-1977," "pre-UCS trial"
- Multiple words: "non-achievement-oriented students"
- Self-compounds: "self-report technique," "self-esteem"
- Misunderstood words: "re-pair (pair again)," "un-ionized (not ionized)"
- Words ending in a, i, or o and starting with meta-, anti-, co-, etc.: "meta-analysis," "anti-intellectual," "co-occur"

**Conclusion:**
- Hyphenation is essential for clear communication in written language.
- Use dictionaries to guide permanent compound usage.
- Temporary compounds require specific guidelines for hyphenation.

### Figures

**Guidelines for Creating Effective Figures in APA Style**

**Principles of Figure Construction**
- All graphical displays other than tables considered figures
- Add substantial value to readers' understanding
- Consider best way to communicate information (table vs figure)
- Follow principles: simplicity, clarity, continuity, information value

**Characteristics of a Good Figure**
- Augments text, conveys essential information
- Omits visually distracting detail
- Easy to read and understand
- Well-planned and prepared
- Consistent with similar figures in the article

**Checklist for Creating Effective Figures**
- Clear images, smooth and sharp lines
- Simple and legible font
- Provide units of measurement and clear labels
- Distinguish between error bars and confidence intervals
  - Specify size of interval or label for error
- Sufficient information in legend or note for understanding
- Easy differentiation of symbols
- Large enough for discernible elements

**Additional Considerations**
- Use color, photographic images, or cropping appropriately
- Check figures carefully for adherence to guidelines.

### Figure Components

**Components of Figure and Table**

**Figure:**
- **Number:** appears above figure in bold
- **Title:** one double-spaced line below figure number in italic title case
- **Image:** chart, graph, photograph, drawing or other illustration
- **Legend:** explains symbols used in figure image (within borders)
- **Notes:** three types: general, specific, and probability (below figure)

**Table:**
- **Number:** all figures that are part of main text numbered using Arabic numerals
- **Content:** includes information needed to understand table
  - Definitions of abbreviations
  - Copyright attribution for adapted table
- **General note:** appears above specific notes in separate paragraph
- **Specific notes:** appear in same paragraph below general note
- **Probability notes:** appear in separate paragraph below specific notes.

**Writing Figure and Table Numbers**
- Write "Figure" and number in bold and flush left
- Figures that appear in appendices follow different numbering scheme (Section 2.14)

### Figure Titles

**Creating Effective Figures**

**Figure Titles**
- Give clear and explanatory titles to figures
- Use title case, double-space title from figure number
- Avoid overly general or overly detailed titles (Section 7.11)

**Figure Images**
- Save images in sufficient resolution for clear printing or viewing (Section 7.4)
- Attend to size and proportion of elements
- Use simple sans serif font (e.g., Arial, Calibri, Lucida Sans Unicode)
- Ensure legibility and consistency in font size and weight
- Use distinct shading for different elements or use patterns
- Limit the number of different shadings in a single graphic
- Ensure that overlapping information can be distinguished from shading
- Use color only when necessary for understanding (Section 7.13)
- Provide adequate contrast for readers with color vision deficiencies (WCAG 2. AA or later)
- Use patterns and lines to differentiate elements if many colors are used
- Avoid gridlines unless they aid understanding
- Avoid 3D effects for decoration only

**Creating Panels**
- Divide figures into panels or create separate figures based on the nature of information being presented
- Panels help readers compare information but increase density on the page.

### Figure Construction

**Communication in Figure Construction**
- Prioritize clear communication
- Labeling panels optional, use position or capital letters (e.g., Panel A)
- Include figure general note to explain each panel

**Citations in Figures**
- Follow Section .11 format for citations
- Use ampersand (&) for "and" in citations

**Figure Legends**
- Explain symbols, line styles, shading or pattern variants
- Capitalize words using title case
- Place within or below image to minimize empty space

**Figure Notes**
- General notes: explain units, symbols, abbreviations not in legend
- Match symbols, abbreviations, terminology between figure, text, and other figures
- Explain shading, color, design elements with meaning
- Individual descriptions for multipanel figures
- Report exact p values or mark statistically significant values
- Position superscripts for specific notes near identified elements

**Relation Between Figures**
- Similar figures or figures of equal importance should be of same size and scale
- Combine figures to facilitate comparisons between content (e.g., combine line graphs, multiple figures into one with multiple panels)

### Photographs

**Photographs as Figures:**
* Special considerations for submission of photographs
* File type, color mode, resolution, contrast, and lighting
* Cropping and indication of alterations
* Ethical considerations against intentional misrepresentation

**Considerations for Electrophysiological, Radiological, Genetic, and Other Biological Data:**

* Complex graphs and images as supplemental materials

**Electrophysiological Data:**
* Clear labeling, including direction of negativity and scale of response
* Necessary information accompanying the figure

**Radiological Imaging Data:**
* Proper labeling and interpretation assistance in figure notes
* Hemisphere identification for axial, coronal, and sagittal slices
* Indication of coordinate space
* Use of cutaway views or surface-rendered images
* Consistent use of color and specification of color scale mapping

**Materials Information:**
* Clear labeling and inclusion of necessary information (scale bars, staining)

**Genetic Data:**
* Clear labeling and presentation of location, distance, markers, and identification methods
* Careful editing for improved communicative value

**Figure Checklist:**
* Necessity of figure
* Acceptable file format and high resolution

- Publication date appears in parentheses immediately after author's name
- Can have multiple works by the same author listed in chronological order
- For works with no date, place them first followed by those with dates.

**Multiple Works by Same Authors:**
- Arrange in chronological order
- Give authors’ surnames only for each subsequent work

**Highlighting Important Sources:**
- Place most relevant sources first in parentheses
- Use "see also" before less relevant sources

**Citing Specific Parts of a Source:**

- Possible parts to cite: pages, paragraphs, sections, tables, figures, supplemental materials, footnotes, chapters, verses, lines, cantos, slide numbers, time stamps
- In the reference list, provide an entry for the entire work, not just the cited part.

### Unknown or Anonymous Author

**Citing Unknown or Anonymous Works**

**Unknown Author:**
- Include title and year in parentheses in text (italicize title if italicized in reference)
- Capitalize titles using title case
- Example: (Interpersonal Skills, 2019)
- For magazine articles: (Understanding Sensory Memory, 2018)

**Anonymous Author:**
- "Anonymous" replaces author name in parentheses
- Example: (Anonymous, 2017)

**Translated, Reprinted, Republished, or Reissued Works**

- Earlier date first
- Example: (Freud, 1900-1953), (Piaget, 1966-2000)

**Repeated Narrative Citations**
- Include author and year in every citation in a new paragraph
- Year can be omitted within the same paragraph if multiple citations from the same work
- Example: Koehler (2016)

**Formatting Author Elements in In-Text Citations**
| Number of Authors | In-Text Citation Style |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| One author        | Last name, year      |
| Two authors       | Last names, year     |

* Define group author abbreviation once in the text and use consistently thereafter
* Use an ampersand (&) between names for two authors when using parenthetical citation

**Avoiding Ambiguity:**
* Multiple works with same publication year, same authors: include a lowercase letter after year (Judge Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012a and Judge Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012b)
* Same surname, different initials: spell out all names in every citation (J. M. Taylor Neimeyer and T. Taylor)
* Same surname, same initials: cite in standard author date format (Chen Chen)

**Works with the Same Author and Same Date:**
* Multiple references have identical author(s) and publication year: include a lowercase letter after year (Judge Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012a and Judge Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012b)

**Abbreviating Group Authors:**
* Abbreviation can be used for well-known groups that help avoid repetition
* Provide full name of group on first mention followed by abbreviation (American Psychological Association (APA))

**General Mentions of Websites, Periodicals, and Common Software/Apps:**
* No reference list entry or in-text citation needed for general mentions of websites without specific page information, periodicals, common software, or apps. Provide the name and version used if known (We created our survey using Qualtrics) or the title of the journal in italicized title case (I searched the Journal of Abnormal Psychology for studies).

### Paraphrases and Quotations

**Paraphrasing**

**Principles of Paraphrasing**
- Restate idea in own words
- Effective writing strategy
- Summarize and synthesize info, focus on significant details
- Compare and contrast relevant details
- Publish authors paraphrase, student authors should emulate
- Use professional tone
- Cite work being paraphrased

**Narrative vs Parenthetical Format**
- Citation in text: narrative or parenthetical (Section .11)

**Avid Readers and Paraphrasing**
- Science fiction/fantasy readers more likely to believe in futuristic scenarios

**Long Paraphrases**
- May continue for several sentences
- Cite work on first mention
- No need to repeat citation if context clear (Figure 8.4)
- Reintroduce citation if paraphrase continues into new paragraph
- Repeat citation when sources switch or incorporate multiple sources (Figure 8.5)

**Impact of Paraphrasing on Helping Professionals**
- Symptoms of impaired wellness: emotional exhaustion, reduced empathy, disrupted relationships, decreased work satisfaction, avoidance of situations, feelings of helplessness (Elwood et al., 2011, Figley, 2002, O'Halloran & Linton, 2000)
- Multiple citations necessary to clarify sources when ideas come from different combinations of works.

### Principles of Direct Quotation

**Principles of Direct Quotations**

**Direct Quotation vs. Paraphrasing**
- Reproduces words verbatim from another work or previously published work
- Use paraphrasing for fitting material to context and writing style
- Use direct quotations for exact definitions, memorable quotes, or responding to exact wording
- Consult instructor or editor regarding quotation limits
- Provide proper citation in parenthetical or narrative format

**Formatting Direct Quotations**

**Short Quotations (Fewer Than 40 Words)**
- Incorporate into the text with double quotation marks
- Cite author, year, and page number in the same sentence
- Parenthetical citation: after quotation or at end of sentence
- Narrative citation: in sentence followed by page number in parentheses

**Examples**
|Text |Correct |Incorrect |Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
|Effective teams can be difficult to describe because high performance along one domain does not translate to high performance along another. (Ervin et al., 2018, p. 470)|Effective teams can be difficult to describe because high performance along one domain does not translate to high performance along another (Ervin et al., 2018, p. 470)|The period marking the end of a sentence should follow the citation, not precede it.|
|Even smart, educated, emotionally stable adults believe superstitions that they recognize are not rational, as exemplified by the existence of people who knock on wood for good luck. (Risen, 2016, p. 202)|Even smart, educated, emotionally stable adults believe superstitions that they recognize are not rational (Risen, 2016, p. 202), as exemplified by the existence of people who knock on wood for good luck|The citation should be outside the quotation marks, not within them.|

**Long Quotations (40 Words or More)**
- Use block format with a separate line and indentation
- Do not use quotation marks for long quotations
- Cite author, year, and page number at the end of the quotation.

### Block Quotations 40 Words or More

**Block Quotations**
* **Long Quotations:** more than 40 words
* No quotation marks for block quotes
* Start on new line, indented 0.5 inches
* Double-space
* Cite source:
	+ Parentheses after quotation: (Author Last Name Year, page number)
	+ Narrative before quotation and page number in parentheses
* Block Quotation with multiple paragraphs: same rules as single paragraph, but indent first line of each subsequent paragraph 0.5 inches more.

**Direct Quotations Without Page Numbers**
* Cite source using one of the following methods:
	+ Provide heading or section name
	+ Abbreviated heading or section name in quotation marks
	+ Paragraph number
	+ Heading or section name and paragraph number.

**Audiovisual Works**
* To directly quote from an audiovisual work, provide a time stamp for the beginning of the quotation.

**Works with Canonically Numbered Sections**
* To directly quote from material with canonically numbered sections (e.g., religious or classical works), use the name of the book, chapter, verse, line, and/or canto instead of a page number.

### Accuracy of Quotations

**Quoting Accurately**
- Importance of accurate direct quotations
- Wording, spelling, and interior punctuation should match original source
- Use "sic" for any errors in the source that might confuse readers
- Consider paraphrasing if error is distracting

**Changes to Quotations**
- Changes not requiring explanation: capitalization, punctuation, quotation marks
- Changes requiring explanation: italics, emphasis, omitted material, inserted material

**Quoting from Bulleted Lists**
- For more information on quoting from bulleted lists, refer to Section 2 in the text

**Changes Not Requiring Explanation**
- Changing first letter of first word
- Changing punctuation marks
- Changing quotation marks
- Omitting footnote or endnote number callouts

**Changes Requiring Explanation**
- Adding emphasis (italics, "emphasis added" in square brackets)
- Omitted material (use ellipsis, "...")
- Inserted material (square brackets)

**Quoting Gossip Studies Example**
- De Backer and Fisher's quotation about gossip (2012)
- Emphasizing certain words in the quotation ("emphasis added")
- Necessity to repeat citations for multiple ideas from the same source

**Omitting Material with Ellipsis**
- Use ellipsis (...) to indicate omitted material within a quotation
- Do not use at beginning or end of quotation unless original source includes it
- Use four periods (period + ellipsis, ". ...") for sentence break within omitted material

**Adding Material in Quotations**
- Use square brackets [ ] to enclose added or explanatory material
- Do not use parentheses for this purpose.

### Quotations That Contain Citations to Other Works When quoting material that contains embedded citations, include the citations within the quotation. D

**Quoting Material with Embedded Citations**
- Quote material containing citations within the quotation marks
- Do not include cited works in reference list unless primary sourced is cited elsewhere
- Footnote or endnote callouts can be omitted
- If citations appear at end of quoted material, cite only work being quoted
- Omit citations if quoting a summary of cited works

**Quotations Containing Quotation Marks**
- Quote material directly from original source if possible
- Cite secondary source if original is unavailable
- Change quotation marks if necessary depending on number of words being quoted

**Short Quotations**
- Use single quotation marks within double quotation marks for short quotations already in quotation marks

**Block Quotations**
- Use double quotation marks around quoted material within block quotations

**Permission to Reprint or Adapt Lengthy Quotations**
- Obtain written permission for lengthy quotations (usually more than 250 words) from copyright holders
- Shorter works such as poems and songs may also require permission.

### Epigraphs

**Epigraphs**
- Definition: quotation introduced before a work, sets stage or serves as summary/counterpoint
- Formatting: indented 0.5 in., no quotation marks, credit line if not in reference list
- Source usually not listed unless important or cited elsewhere

**Research and Epigraph from Academic Source**
- Epigraph from Zora Neale Hurston: "Research is formalized curiosity"
- Reference list entry for academic sources of epigraphs or quotes used with permission

**Quotations From Research Participants**
- Quotations in text: fewer than 40 words in quotation marks, longer quotations in block quotations
- Not included in reference list, stated as from participants in text
- Abide by ethical agreements regarding confidentiality and anonymity
- Disguise materials if necessary (pseudonyms, obscure identifying info, aggregate data)
- Example: participant Julia described new motherhood as best/hardest time of her life

**School Policy Documents and Confidentiality**
- Quoting sources related to methodology requires discretion
- May discuss information if suitably disguised to protect confidentiality/anonymity
- Our study was conducted at a high school in Atlanta, used administrative documents for context.

## REFERENCE LIST

**Reference Lists**
- Purpose: Identify and retrieve works cited in a paper
- Choose references judiciously, only include used works
- Differences between reference lists and bibliographies

**Creating Reference List Entries**

**Determining the Reference Category**
- Works organized by group, category, and type
- Textual works, data sets, software, tests, audiovisual media, online media
- Determine group, category, and reference type for citation

**Using the Webpages and Websites Reference Category**
- Use when work does not fit into another category
- Ask: "What type of work is on this website?"
- Choose most similar reference type and follow example
- Examples: report from a government website, webpage from a government website

**Online and Print References**
- Same template for print and online versions
- Differences in source element for online works with DOIs or URLs
- Database information not usually included

**Principles of Reference List Entries**
- Who (author), When (date), What (title), Where (source)
- Answer these questions to create a reference for any work
- See sections on author, date, title, and source for more info.

**Reference Information Locations**
Figure 9.1 shows an example of an article title page highlighting the locations of the reference elements and their placement in a reference list entry.

### Date

**Definition and Format of Date Element**
* **Definition:** The date refers to the date of publication in a reference.
* Takes various forms: year only, year, month, day, year and season, or range of dates.
* For books, use copyright date on the work's copyright page.
* For journal articles, use the year of the volume.
* When citing webpages and websites, ensure the copyright date applies to the content being cited.
* Use more specific dates for frequently published works.
* Enclose the date in parentheses followed by a period.
* For unpublished or informally published works, provide the year produced.
* Do not use "in progress" or "submitted for publication."
* For works with approximate publication dates, use "ca." (circa).

**9.13-9.16 Format of the Date Element and Special Cases**
* **Format:** Follow the date format shown in each reference category.
* More specific dates for frequently published works.
* Use parentheses and period.
* For unpublished or informally published works, provide the year produced.
* Do not use "in progress" or "submitted for publication."
* If a work has been accepted but not yet published, use "in press."
* For advance online publications, use the year of advance online publication.
* Use final publication date if both are available.

**Updated or Reviewed Online Works**
* Some online works note when updated.
* If a specific content update is attributable to what's being cited, use the updated date in the reference.
* Do not include a date of last review in a reference because reviewed content may not have been changed.
* Ignore a noted review date for the purposes of the reference.

**Retrieval Dates**
* For unarchived works that are likely or meant to change, provide a retrieval date in the source element.
* Indicates to readers that the version they retrieve may be different from the one used.
* For archived works, a retrieval date is not necessary because the archived version is stable and can be retrieved via a permalink.

**Works with No Date**
* For works with no known or determinable publication date, write "n.d." (no date) in parentheses.
* Put a period after the "n" and after the "d," with no space between them.
* The date also appears as "n.d." in the corresponding in-text citation.

### Title

**Title Element**

- For conceptually related but separate works: only include book title, not series title
- Bracketed descriptions for non-peer reviewed works to aid identification
- Capitalize first letter of description, do not italicize
- Example: Comprehensive meta-analysis (Version 3.3.070): Computer software

**Bracketed Descriptions:**
- Provide a description in square brackets after title to help identify works outside peer-reviewed literature
- Examples: Instagram and Telegram: @PDFEnglish.press releases, films, YouTube videos, photographs, software, data sets, manuscripts, dissertations and theses, social media references with attached links or images
- Consistency of wording is helpful but alter to best convey information
- Use succinct descriptions

**Works without a Title:**
- Include description in square brackets instead of title
- Example: Map showing the population density of the United States as of the year 2010
- For untitled comments on periodical articles, include up to the first 2 words and a description
- For untitled social media posts, include up to the first 2 words and a bracketed description.

- Arrange works by authors with the same name in birth order
- See Figure 9.2 for examples and review published articles or APA Style website for further examples.

**Order of Surname and Given Name**
- Check author's preferred form (website, institution, bio) or their previous publications
- Example: "hang, Y.-C." in China but "Yi-Chen hang" in the US, list as "hang, Y.-C." in reference list. (Section 9.9 for more)

- Papers are conceptually similar, but stand alone as research reports
- Benefits: time and effort saved by having paper already formatted
- Consult university editorial office for guidelines

**Strategy 2: Reformatting to Fit Journal Scope and Style**
- Adjust length, references, sections, etc. to fit journal requirements
- Eliminate extraneous content, provide necessary information
- Consult APA Style website for more information

**Length**
- Shorten overall paper length
- Eliminate text within sections or entire sections
- Narrow focus to specific topic for each paper

**References**
- Include only most pertinent and recent references
- Ensure citations contribute to understanding of research topic

**Introduction Section**
- Eliminate extraneous content
- Describe research questions, aims, or hypotheses

**Method Section**
- Provide necessary information for readers
- Refer readers to previous works or supplemental materials

**Results and Discussion Sections**
- Report relevant results only
- Adjust discussion accordingly
- Ensure findings answer original research questions

**Tables and Figures**
- Make sure essential and do not reproduce text content

**Preparing for Publication: Additional Tips**

### Understanding the Editorial Publication Process

**Understanding the Editorial Publication Process**

**Manuscript Submission and Progression**
- Beginning of editorial process: author submits manuscript to a peer-reviewed journal
- Potential paths from submission to publication: Figure 12.1
- Scholarly journals: original, primary publications not previously published
- Peer-reviewed literature: builds the field's knowledge with significant contributions

**Confidentiality and Peer Review**
- Reviewers carefully assess manuscripts for originality, rigor, and significance
- Submitted manuscript considered a confidential document during review process
- Publisher policies regarding ethics and manuscript sharing (Sections 1.1, 1.2)

**Roles of Editors**

**Editorial Hierarchy**
- Journal lead editor/editor-in-chief: final authority on publication decisions
- Associate editors: responsible for specific content areas or portions of submissions
- Consulting and advisory editors: review manuscripts, advise on conflicting reviews
- Ad hoc reviewers: provide feedback to editors or associate editors

**Correspondence with Editors**
- Address correspondence to the editor with whom you've been communicating
- Lead editor may make decisions different from reviewers/associate editor recommendations.

**Flowchart of Manuscript Progression From Submission to Publication**
1. **Author submits manuscript to journal**
2. **Editor decision**
   a. Manuscript rejected outright
   b. Manuscript undergoes peer review
3. **Manuscript rejected or requires revisions**
   a. Author must choose another journal
   b. Author revises and resubmits according to feedback
   i. Additional revision needed
     1. Author completes publication forms and reviews proofs
4. **Manuscript accepted**
5. **Additional revision or peer review required**
6. **Author completes Publication forms and reviews proofs**

### Peer Review Process

**Peer Review Process**

- Limitations identification
- Scholarly input into editorial decision
- Decision ultimate responsibility of editor

**Providing Reviewers for Manuscript Submission**
- Importance of careful selection
- Consideration of researchers' consistency with topic, similar area of study, and scholarly record
- Journal's masked review policy

**Masked Review Process**
- Hidden identities of authors and reviewers
- Author guidelines for manuscript formatting
- Variations in masking: both ways, one way, or unmasked

**Timing of Peer Review**
- Length and complexity dependent
- Editor's determination and evaluation by reviewers
- Formal peer review almost always required
- Approximately 2 to 3 months process
- Author follow up if no decision is made after 3 months.

### Manuscript Decisions

**Manuscript Decisions and Process**
* Manuscript decisions based on scholarly quality, importance, and appropriateness
* Editor's responsibility for acceptance, revision, or rejection

* Required paperwork completion (copyright transfer, disclosures, permissions)

**Invitation to Revise and Resubmit**
* Manuscripts with potential for eventual publication but not ready for final acceptance
* Substantial revisions needed (additional data, experiments, analyses, shortening)
* Not a guarantee of eventual publication by that journal
* May have time constraints or change in editors

**Review Process**
* Editors may request additional material from authors
* Additional reviewers may be solicited if expertise needed or previous reviewer unavailable
* Explanation provided for required revisions to authors
* Authors expected to respond thoughtfully and judiciously
* Response to reviewers includes addressing all critiques and rationale for decisions not to make changes
* Providing a response facilitates the review process and helps editor decide on publication

**Brief Report Option**
* Some journals offer authors the opportunity to revise paper into brief reports
* Limited scope, novel findings that need further replication, or replications and extensions of prior published work

**Rejection**
* Manuscripts rejected due to: falling outside coverage domain, severe flaws, or limited contribution to field
* Editor may reject outright without review if not appropriate for journal or unlikely to be evaluated favorably during peer review process
* Manuscript that has been rejected by a journal may not be resubmitted without invitation from the editor.
