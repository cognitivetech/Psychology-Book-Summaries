# Dark Nights of the Soul

**This summary was made with [Ollama eBook Summary](https://github.com/cognitivetech/ollama-ebook-summary/).**

> Our lives are filled with emotional tunnels: the loss of a loved one or end of a relationship, aging and illness, career disappointments or just an ongoing sense of dissatisfaction with life. Society tends to view these “dark nights” in clinical terms as obstacles to be overcome as quickly as possible. But Moore shows how honoring these periods of fragility as periods of incubation and positive opportunities to delve the soul’s deepest needs can provide healing and a new understanding of life’s meaning. Dark Nights of the Soul presents these metaphoric dark nights not as the enemy, but as times of transition, occasions to restore yourself, and transforming rites of passage, revealing an uplifting and inspiring new outlook on such topics as:
> 
> - The healing power of melancholy
> - The sexual dark night and the mysteries of matrimony
> - Finding solace during illness and in aging
> - Anxiety, anger, and temporary Insanities
> - Linking creativity, spirituality, and emotional struggles
> - Finding meaning and beauty in the darkness [Dark Nights of the Soul](https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Nights-Soul-Finding-Through/dp/1592401333/&tag=cognitivetech-20)

* Penetrate beneath surface, let the issue show itself
* Medicine and psychology prefer understandable and treatable cases
* Focus on fulfilling fate and discovering meaning
* Caring for oneself at deepest level (comfort over cure)
* Organize life to support process (incubating soul)
* Concentrate, reflect, think, and talk about situation seriously with trusted friends.

**Oscar Wilde's Experience of Imprisonment**

* Learned from experience: Suffering is a sacred process that makes one holy
* Materialism coarsens the soul (absorption in materialistic culture)
* Giving up clinical language, speak concretely from personal experience

  * Read books, including one about slavery in America, to find inspiration during solitude
  * Reflected on how slaves endured despite their conditions
- Moral and spiritual survival is possible even when physical freedom can't be achieved
- Examples:
  * Thomas More (16th century): wrote philosophy while imprisoned for thirteen months before execution
  * Marquis de Sade: ranted against jailers but wrote important fiction under duress
  * Nelson Mandela: prepared himself in jail to be a great leader
- Every dark night is unique and can lead to personal growth and self-discovery
- Importance of rich, solid, and useful ideas for dealing with the darkness:

* We are all artists of our own lives, creating our stories and expressing ourselves
* Visiting art by artists who have experienced deep emotions, such as Mark Rothko, can inspire a sense of depth and transformation

**The Power of Darkness and Transformation**

* A dark night can shock us back to life and give us the edge we need to do good work
* Being in the presence of artists who have lived deeply, such as Rothko or Samuel Beckett, can help us recover our own depth
* In times of transformation, it can be beneficial to assume a fetal position, both emotionally and intellectually, and be still
* Shunryu Suzuki's recommendation of "one-act Samadhi" encourages concentration on the present moment and being fully engaged in experiences

**The Journey of Soul**

* In times of darkness and transformation, it is important not to try to fight or make sense of it, but rather to allow the process to unfold naturally
* Embrace the journey of soul that will reveal our destiny.

#### SPIRITUALITY OF THE DEEP

**Spirituality of the Deep**

**Psychology's Limitations:**
- Language may not fully express the depths

**Religion's Challenges:**
- Often avoids the dark by sentimentalizing light and demonizing darkness
- Religious traditions contain wisdom but may offer empty promises

**Importance of Alertness:**
- Use intelligence and discernment when dealing with spiritual matters
- Avoid infantilization, as darkness is meant to initiate spiritual growth

**The Spiritual Life:**
- Deep and transcendent

- Develops character, discernment, emotional toughness, intellect, compassion, insight, and vision

**Religion vs. Real Religion:**
- Religion can offer both depth and vision but may lack substance
- Bonhoeffer: religion should help us face problems directly instead of relying on a divine solution from outside

**Bonhoeffer's Perspective:**

- Discover the true meaning of religion through openness to life's mysteries.

#### JONAH'S CALLING

**Jonah's Calling and the Inner Daimon**

- Sort out voices of fear from hope
- Understand the larger fate at work

**Struggling with Inner Urges**
- Dark nights and prolonged struggle
- Not necessarily destructive, can give life to relationship
- Marriage: partner's daimon as well as their person

**Individual Callings vs. Shared Destinies**
- Importance of recognizing and respecting individual callings
- Live shared destinies instead of trying to blend lives together

### CHAPTER FIVE: LIFE'S IRONIES

**Chapter Five: Embracing Life's Ironies**

**The Importance of Imagination and Wit**
- During challenging times, an active and receptive imagination is helpful
- In a fact-driven world, imagination can seem soft or nonessential
- The problem is more pronounced in North America, where spirituality is viewed as dour

**The Perils of Moralists and Literalists**

- Irony keeps out superficial sentimentality and intransigent moralism

**The Cultural Shift towards Ignorance and Sleepiness**
- "Cool" mindlessness is a way to sleep through life
- Media caters to the lowest common denominator of education and intellectual curiosity
- Lack of wit and intellectual challenge leads to a broad-based cultural slumber

#### INSIDE, OUTSIDE, IN BETWEEN

**Love Triangles**

**Description**: Caught in a love triangle, people often view their "side" relationship as an excursion outside of normal life. It can be both alluring and disturbing due to its liminal quality.

**Attraction**: The transgressive nature of the situation may add excitement and importance to the relationship. French philosopher Georges Bataille believed that real love involves a transgression.

**Liminality**: Love triangles take place in transient settings, away from public view. Couples appreciate this separation from their normal lives and find it creative.

**Issues**: Some people struggle with the negative consequences of their actions on family and relationships. Children may disown one parent or resent the situation. The couple may feel torn between respectability and adventure, leading to an impasse.

**Renewal vs. Suffering**: Couples in long-term relationships might seek to recapture the liminality of their love by eloping or engaging in other transgressive behaviors. However, they may also fear the potential negative outcomes and the return to familiar problems within a respectable relationship.

**Decision**: The dilemma of whether to leave one relationship for another or try to make things work is a profound impasse that leaves people uncertain about their future choices.

**Considerations**: Ultimately, individuals must weigh the desire for excitement and new experiences against the potential costs to themselves and others. Both respectability and adventure require equal attention.

Creative individuals face challenges in evaluating their work's quality, dealing with their own self-assessment, and striving for commercial success.

- Important to find balance between romanticizing and rejecting child quality of soul
- Inferiority feelings not negative, can keep humility and allow creativity to flow.

#### THE LOST CHILD

**The Concept of Human Development:**
- Early Christian period and late Renaissance: humans believed in the soul descending through planets, receiving imprints
- In modern times, people become more complex as they progress through stages and experiences
- Childhood is a part of who we are, not something left behind
- **Jung's discovery:** acknowledging childhood experiences can lead to understanding one's life as an adult

- Young people sometimes recreate their lives by defying societal expectations

**The Child Spirit vs. Childishness**
- Child spirit is not literal childishness or anti-intellectual emotionalism
- It adds color and tone to life without dominating it
- Balancing maturity and the child spirit enhances growth

**Glenn Gould's Example**
- Gould's unconventional piano playing was ridiculed due to his childlike humor and departure from expectations
- Child spirit balanced out heavy pedanticism and depression in his personality

**The Saturnine Ego**
- Western ego can be both imaginative, skilled, and profound, but also depressive and restrictive
- Playfulness may not be deeply ingrained in this attitude toward life, focusing on hard work and wise spending of time instead.

#### BEING THE CHILD

**Childlike Creativity**
- Bringing to life a creative spirit akin to a child's is challenging
- Slip from childlike spirit to childishness or hurt, depressed child
- Example: English composer Peter Warlock (Philip Heseltine)
- Combined interest in occult and English folk music
- Struggled with self-doubt and overvalued contemporaries' work
- Quote from D.H. Lawrence: "He seemed empty, uncreated"
- Warlock saw himself as "completely fuddled, groping blindly in the dark for something of whose very nature I was quite ignorant."
- Committed suicide at 36 due to self-destructive tendencies
- Could not reconcile childlike creativity with adult life
- Fixated on older composer Frederick Delius as mentor/model
- Depression might have been transformative spiritual dark night, instead of ruinous tragedy.

**Balancing Childlike Creativity and Maturity**
- Maintain playful habits while keeping the child's spirit in check

* Soul mates are deeper connections rather than individuals solely intended to make you happy

* Critical view on life, recognizing its tragedy and evil, does not necessarily lead to depression
* A dark night of the soul may lead to deeper understanding and wisdom

**Relationships and Decision Making**

* Impasse in relationships or work can be a creative time for the imagination
* Failure to act on decisions due to fear or mistrust of emotions can prolong the impasse
* A decision need not be made with willpower alone; it can arise from the ripening of a thought or feeling
* Imagination is crucial in dealing with challenges and making necessary changes
* Expanding your imagination of what is happening to you during a difficult time can offer a broader perspective

**Approaches to Life**
