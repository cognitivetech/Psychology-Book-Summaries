### DISPELLING MYTHS ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY

Psychology is a discipline that faces numerous myths and misconceptions, which can hinder our understanding of its true nature and the contributions it makes to science. The following are some common myths about psychology and their correctives:

**Myth 1: Psychology is nothing more than common sense**

* People often believe that psychological findings are obvious because they seem logical after learning the outcome.
* This phenomenon is known as hindsight bias or the "I-knew-it-all-along effect."
* Psychology challenges many commonsense assumptions with research findings that may be counterintuitive, such as the bystander effect and the misconception about helping on busy streets.

**Myth 2: Whatever it is, psychology is not a science**

* Psychology is often misunderstood as not being a science due to its subject matter focusing on human behavior and emotions.
* However, psychology relies on scientific methods like hypothesis testing, careful observation, experimentation, measurement, analysis, and replication.
* Neuroscience and the study of the brain are technical parts of psychology, making it a legitimate science.

**Myth 3: Psychology is a pseudoscience**

* Pseudosciences lack empirical data to support their claims about behavior.
* Psychology, as a science, is based on scientific research and evidence-based practices.

**Myth 4: Psychologists know how to read minds**

* Psychologists do not have the ability to read people's minds.
* Their insights come from years of study, observation, and inference, not intuition or mind-reading abilities.

**Myth 5: Psychologists = therapists**

**Myth 7: Psychology is personally defined**

* Personal experience cannot be the sole basis for psychological phenomena.
* Psychologists rely on empirical evidence and scientific methods to build a knowledge corpus of human behavior and emotions.

In summary, psychology is a science that uses rigorous research methods to study human behavior, emotions, and thoughts. It challenges common sense assumptions and provides valuable insights into the human condition. Understanding these myths and their correctives will help you appreciate the true nature of psychology as a discipline.

### KNOWING YOURSELF: SELF-ASSESSMENT OF YOUR PERSONALITY AND SKILLS

**Self-Assessment of Personality and Skills: Understanding Your Unique Traits and Their Impact on Career Choices**

**Background:** Industrial and organizational (I/O) psychologists argue that people's personalities, unique behavioral traits, can influence the type of work they do best. This concept applies not only to choosing a career but also selecting a college major. Standardized occupation interest inventories help individuals assess their personality traits and skills for vocational possibilities.

**Self-Assessment:** To identify your traits that might be a good fit for a psychology major or any other field, consider the following questions:

* What are your best features or skills?
* Do you enjoy interacting with people one-on-one or in groups?
* Do you prefer working alone or as part of a team?
* Are people often seeking your advice?
* What activities do you enjoy and why?
* What hobbies or things do you do when not studying or working?
* What would your perfect work environment be like?
* How do you deal with interpersonal conflict?
* What creates stress for you?
* Have past jobs made you feel stressed, and how did you manage it?
* Do you prefer working on small details or the "big picture"?
* How do you define success?
* Does your life have a purpose?
* What is your destiny?
* What would you like to be known and remembered for in the long run?
* What would you change about the world?
* One word that describes you?
* One word others might use to describe you?

**Seeking a Fit Between You and Your Working Environment:**

Psychologist John Holland developed the trait model of career choice, which helps individuals link their personality qualities (interests, needs, skills, values, learning styles, attitudes) to particular settings where work occurs. His model categorizes individuals into six personal orientations and organizes occupations into six work environments. 

A good fit between a person's personality and the environment can lead to greater fulfillment, success, and determination in their major and career.

**Holland's Six Personal Orientations:**

1. **Realistic:** Values concrete and physical tasks, practical, focused on problem-solving, perceives themselves as possessing mechanical skills but lacking social or interpersonal skills, drawn to manual and athletic activities, enjoys using tools and machines.
2. **Investigative:** Loves solving scientific, intellectual, and mathematical puzzles and problems, methodical, self-reflective, critical, curious, highly analytical, values independence, enjoys taking courses in the physical and biological sciences, mathematics, and chemistry.
3. **Artistic:** Drawn to unstructured projects that provide freedom and breadth to explore and express feeling and emotion, independent, free-spirited, expressive, imaginative, innovative.
4. **Social:** Drawn toward educational, helping, and religious careers, enjoys working with others on teams, values social and educational issues, cooperative, friendly, conscientious, persuasive, insightful, sensitive to others' needs.
5. **Enterprising:** Likes leading, motivating, inspiring, and persuading others, values economic and political achievement, relishes the chance to supervise, enjoys exerting control, extroverted, sociable, happy, self-confident, popular, assertive.
6. **Conventional:** Likes order, prefers engaging in systematic, concrete tasks that are prescribed, uses both verbal and quantitative data, sees themselves as conformists, identifies with their clerical and numerical abilities, excels at following rules and orders, detail-oriented, drawn to straightforward rather than open-ended problems.

**Choosing a Career Based on Your Personal Orientation:**

1. Identify the one type from Holland's six orientations that is the best fit for you.
2. Choose a second and third orientation but remember they are idealized types, no one person will fit any type perfectly.
3. Review Table 3.2 to understand the work environments linked to your personal orientations and their representative college majors.
4. Determine if each of the three personal orientations that most closely describe you are linked to work environments that sound pleasing to you and plausible options for you.

**Holland's Six Work Environments and Personal Orientations**

Holland identified six types of work environments based on the nature of the tasks, interactions, and settings. These work environments are linked to personal orientations, which can help individuals identify potential careers and majors that align with their interests.

1. **Realistic Settings:**
   - Characterized by concrete, physical tasks using mechanical skills and considerable persistence
   - Sample careers: draftsperson, automobile mechanic, law enforcement officer, electrician, engineer, cook, pilot, machine operator
   - Sample majors: electrical or aerospace engineering, architecture, criminal justice, environmental studies
2. **Investigative Settings:**
   - Research laboratories, scientific groups, medical settings, case conferences
   - Sample careers: computer programmer, clinical psychologist, veterinarian, dentist, marine biologist, physician, physician's assistant, chemist
   - Sample majors: computer science, biology, biochemistry, astronomy, anthropology
3. **Artistic Settings:**
   - Concert or performing halls, theaters, libraries, radio or television studios, art, photography, design, music studios
   - Sample careers: actor, painter, advertiser, sculptor, musician, author, editor, designer, photographer, interior designer, architect
   - Sample majors: English, art, art history, interior design, graphic art, advertising, architecture, design, and interior design
4. **Social Settings:**
   - Hospitals, colleges and universities, public and private schools, churches, temples, synagogues, recreational centers, mental health organizations
   - Sample careers: counselor, teacher, professor, nurse, social worker, judge, minister, rabbi, sociologist, psychologist
   - Sample majors: human development, psychology, philosophy, sociology, religious studies, education, special education, and social work
5. **Enterprising Settings:**

   - Sample careers: attorney, realtor, politician, salesperson, manager
   - Sample majors: business administration, economics, broadcasting, hospitality and tourism, industrial relations, finance
6. **Conventional Settings:**
   - Office settings, banks, post offices, any business office, filing rooms
   - Sample careers: receptionist, financial counselor, accountant, banker, bookkeeper, data processor, office clerk, court reporter
   - Sample majors: accounting, finance, medical records, mathematics, and statistics

**Identifying Your Personal Orientations:**
The goal is to identify and rank your top three personal orientations based on the Holland code (RCE, SIA, CON, REA, INT, ART). This information can help guide you in choosing potential careers and majors. For example, an RCE person might be interested in engineering or law enforcement, while an SEA person could consider a psychology major.

**Resources for Career Planning:**
Consider visiting your college or university's career services or career development office to learn about available resources that can help you plan your future career.

### KNOW YOUR MOTIVES

**I. Introduction**

- Being happy is an important motive for making choices regarding education, work, and career.
- Making more money beyond a certain point does not lead to increased happiness.

**II. The Limitation of Money as a Motivator**

- Research shows that once people exceed an income of about $75,000 per year, their happiness levels do not change much (Kahneman & Deaton, 2010).
- More money means more work hours and less time for leisure and relaxation, leading to no increase in happiness (Kahneman et al., 2006).

**III. A Major Success Story: Tim's Journey**

- Tim loved his college experience and wanted a career that allowed him to help people without committing to graduate or professional school.
- He became an academic advisor, using his communication skills, problem-solving abilities, and passion for psychology to help students.
- Tim's advice: consider what you value, enjoy doing, are passionate about, and are good at when choosing a career.

**IV. The Importance of Meaning in Work**

- Having meaning in work refers to having a sense of direction, coherent values, and personal philosophy.
- Doing enjoyable work provides feelings of fulfillment and improves both the individual and the world (Wrzesniewski et al., 2003).

**V. Three Categories of Work: Jobs, Careers, and Vocations**

- Professionals tend to view their work as falling into one of three categories: jobs, careers, and vocations.
- A job is a means to an end, providing a salary but little personal satisfaction.
- A career is focused on advancement and increasing income, often at the expense of personal fulfillment.
- A vocation is work that aligns with one's values, passions, and abilities, leading to a sense of purpose and meaning.

### Jobs, careers, and vocations

**I. Jobs**

* A source of income to support living expenses
* Often provide little satisfaction or meaning for those who hold them
* People in jobs often anticipate weekends, holidays, and vacations
* Examples include: assembly line work, retail sales, or administrative positions

**II. Careers**

* Holding a position long enough to receive promotions and advancement
* Competitive element with coworkers for better titles, offices, and pay raises
* People in careers may not necessarily enjoy the work but are motivated by advancement opportunities
* Examples include: law, medicine, engineering, or business management

**III. Vocations**

* Following a calling where work is an integral part of one's life
* Provides satisfaction, pleasure, and identity
* People in vocations bring their work home and may not look forward to retirement
* Examples include: teaching, writing, art, or music

**Comparison**

* People with vocations are more satisfied with their work and lives compared to those with jobs or careers
* Those with vocations devote more time to their work than others
* Vocations can lead to civic accolades but may not provide ample salaries
* Choosing a major that aligns with one's passion and commitment is essential for finding a vocation

### REALITY CHECK THE OLDER PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR

   - Intentional plagiarism involves knowingly copying phrases, sentences, or paragraphs from published works or the internet.
   - Unintentional plagiarism occurs when you inadvertently use someone else's words or ideas without proper citation.
   - Professors can easily detect plagiarized work due to inconsistent writing styles and access to technology.
   - The consequences of plagiarizing include penalties, loss of trust, and damage to your reputation.
3. **Avoid Behaviors that Tarnish Your Reputation:**
   - Cheating: using another's work without consent, collaborating on projects meant to be independent, altering grades, etc.
   - Submitting the same work to multiple classes.
   - Fabricating information or sources.
   - Misusing materials like unauthorized calculators or advance exam copies.
   - Interfering with other students' work or attempting to influence teachers through bribes or threats.

  * Transfer the course from another institution (unacceptable performance or damaging to academic record)
* **Professors not responding to emails:** Possible reasons and solutions:
  * Overwhelmed by email volume
  * Students' uncivil email requests
  * Troubleshoot ineffective email requests in Measuring Up

**Addressing Unfair Treatment or Disrespectful Behavior from Professors**

* Most of the time, best course of action is to ride it out and move on
* If maltreatment causes serious distress or poses a threat:
  * Visit professor with a trusted person (potential witness)
  * Be specific about problematic behaviors
  * Recognize professors hold more power; compelling evidence needed for positive outcome
  * Department head, dean, discrimination complaint officer, or lowest level possible in organizational hierarchy

**Dealing with Professors' Inappropriate Boundaries**

* Protect yourself from unwanted attention:
  * Redirect attention back to the class
  * Do not meet alone or off campus
* Report concerns to department head if attention is unrelenting
* Predatory faculty members are rare but damaging; most campuses prohibit professor-student romances
* Wait to begin a romance with a professor after they no longer have grading power over you

### MEASURING UP SHARPEN YOUR IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT

**Impression Management through Effective Email Communication**

Email has become a common method of communication between students and faculty members. However, a poorly constructed email can negatively impact the impression a professor has of a student's professionalism. 

> Mrs. Thompson: Missed class yesterday. Was there anything important from class that will be on the next exam? Need to know right away so I can plan my weekend. Catchya later. Badass95@student.mail

**Problems with the Original Email**

1. **Informal approach:** The email contains incomplete sentences, colloquial language ("catchya later"), and lacks respect towards the professor.
2. **Lack of identification:** The student does not identify themselves, making it difficult for the professor to respond effectively.
3. **Offensive nickname:** The use of "Badass95@student.mail" may be perceived as offensive by some professors.
4. **Implying unimportance of class material:** The email implies that the professor may have spent class time on unimportant matters.
5. **Pressuring the professor:** The student puts pressure on the professor to respond immediately for their convenience.
6. **Lack of apology and explanation:** The student does not apologize for missing class or offer an explanation for their absence.

**Suggestions for a More Professional Email**

1. **Formal salutation:** Address the professor with an appropriate title, such as "Professor Thompson."
2. **Identification:** Clearly identify yourself to the professor.
3. **Apologize for missing class:** Acknowledge your absence and apologize for it.
4. **Explain your absence:** Provide a valid reason for missing class.
5. **Show initiative:** Demonstrate that you have taken steps to make up for missed material, such as reading the syllabus or completing assigned work.
6. **Polite and respectful tone:** Use a polite and respectful tone throughout the email.
7. **Ask for specific information:** Request only the necessary information from the professor.
8. **Provide contact information:** Offer your contact information to make it easy for the professor to respond.

**Example of a More Effective Email**

> Professor Thompson,
> 
> I apologize for missing Cognitive Psychology on Tuesday due to last-minute car troubles. I have read through the syllabus and am current in my work, but is there anything else that happened in class that I need to know about to prepare more effectively for the next exam? I appreciate any feedback you can provide.

- Understanding good research will help make connections among advanced classes.

**Statistics**
- Psychologists emphasize description and measurement in their work.
- Statistics is a powerful tool for determining outcomes of manipulations.
- Most curricula require a basic statistics class to learn tools like correlations and analysis of variance.
- Becoming comfortable with statistical programs like R or SPSS will help conduct impactful studies.

**Prerequisites**
- Professors design program curriculum to provide instructional scaffolding.
- Prerequisites help students build knowledge base and focus on concepts being presented instead of catching up.
- Persuading a professor to waive a prerequisite is usually not a good idea.

**Minor and Double Major**
- A minor may not be required but can make you more attractive in the workforce or for graduate schools.
- Consider areas that align with future goals.
- Double majoring requires commitment and hard work, potentially delaying graduation.

**Certificates**
- Some programs offer certificates in certain subject areas.
- Certificates provide little extra value but can impress potential employers.
- Receiving a certificate does not guarantee a greater payoff than completing the major.

**Independent Study Ideas**
- Pick an appealing chapter from an introductory textbook and explore concepts that pique your interest.
- Discuss ideas with professors during office hours to develop manageable designs.

## CHAPTER 7: DOING PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH FROM START TO FINISH

**Context for Research in Psychology:**

- Required class for psychology majors
- Students will design and execute their own experiments
- No prior experience necessary, instruction will be gradual

**Reviewing Research Fundamentals:**

**Psychological research is empirical:**

- Generates objective evidence to describe, explain, or predict behavior
- Uses both quantitative (numbers-based) and qualitative (narrative-based) research

**Strategies for Addressing Research Questions:**

- Basic: explaining fundamental "laws" of behavior
- Applied: practical concerns
- Experimental research: controlled comparisons, manipulating variables

**Experiments:**

- Involve controlled comparisons
- Manipulate independent variable (IV) and measure dependent variable (DV)
- Differences in groups allow for cause-and-effect relationships
- Random assignment ensures equal chance for treatment or control group

**Common Research Alternatives to Experiments:** 
- Correlational studies
- Case studies
- Surveys and questionnaires
- Naturalistic observations

**Creating Research Ideas:**
- Based on literature, not personal experience
- Make scientific claims
- Write stylistically appropriate research papers and lab reports

**Developing Research Ideas:**
1. **Personal Interest:** Identify topics that interest you
2. **Literature Review:** Read extensively about a topic to identify gaps in knowledge
3. **Brainstorming:** Generate multiple ideas, then narrow down to the most feasible and interesting one
4. **Collaboration:** Work with peers or professors for suggestions and feedback
5. **Refining Your Idea:** Clearly define your research question, hypothesis, and methods

**Using Library Resources:**

- Psychology databases: PsycINFO, ERIC, PubMed
- Keywords: Use specific terms related to your topic
- Citation management tools: EndNote, Mendeley, Zotero

**Using Cyberspace Wisely:**

- Evaluate sources: Check for credibility, accuracy, and bias
- Avoid plagiarism: Properly cite all sources used

**Writing Styles:**

- APA (American Psychological Association) style: Common in psychology research
- Clear, concise writing
- Use of headings, subheadings, and bullet points

**Presenting Findings:**

- Written reports: Lab reports, research papers
- Oral presentations: Poster sessions, conference presentations
- Tips for effective presentations: Engage audience, use visuals, practice delivery.

**Alternative Research Approaches in Psychological Experiments**

**Observational Approaches**

* Observational research: investigator observes and records ongoing behavior of humans or organisms, reports results qualitatively and quantitatively.
  * **Case study research**: detailed examination of a person's behavior, qualitative, narrative description.
  * **Naturalistic research**: researchers make careful records of behavior in nonexperimental contexts.

**Correlational Approaches (Establishing Associations but Not Causality)**

* Correlational research: identifies nature of associations between variables, not causal results.
  * **Survey research**: sample of people answer standardized questions to infer feelings/thoughts about a topic or issue.
  * **Archival research**: uses existing records to determine patterns among variables (measures of academic achievement, work performance, traffic citation records).
* Quasi-experimental research: uses experimental format without random assignment of participants to groups, investigators unsure if result due to independent variable or participant qualities.

**Approaches Focusing on Published Information**

* Literature reviews: summarize peer-reviewed information about a topic.
* Meta-analyses: synthesize trends across related studies to determine where evidence lies in explaining behavior.

**Finding Research Ideas**

* Observe and investigate behaviors around you.
* Extend published research by altering hypotheses or conditions.
* Find paradoxes that contradict expectations.
* Identify real-life problems that could be addressed through psychological interventions.

**Example of a Successful Psychology Researcher: Jim, the Director of a Perception Lab**

* Jim declared psychology major in college and was inspired by Freud's work.
* Got sidetracked by experimental psychology and psychophysics during graduate school.
* Fascinated by auditory perception due to love of music and sound.
* Joined university's perception lab, now serves as director, writes grants, publishes findings, and teaches.
* Primary work focuses on digital methods of altering speech signals for better communication.
* Enjoys designing experiments and analyzing results but feels strain from grant writing and publication pressures.
* Advice: be concise, clear, compelling in scientific writing to keep readers engaged.

### Measuring Up: Brainstorming Your Way to Research Topics

**I. Introduction**

* Marcus' experience writing a developmental psychology research paper on birth-order effects

**III. Group Brainstorming**

* One person serves as the leader and keeps ideas flowing
* Recorder writes down all ideas without judgment
* Discuss and edit ideas to determine potential topics

**IV. Importance of Using Published Research in Psychology Papers**

* Instructors expect data to be scientifically reliable
* Personal experience or opinion, casual observation, hearsay not considered valid sources
* Popular sources like newspapers, magazines, social media, television programs, YouTube videos not reliable

**V. Reliable Sources for Psychology Research**

- **Journal Articles**
  * Peer-reviewed scientific or scholarly articles
  * Claims supported by agreed-upon theories, research methods, and public evidence

### DISCUSSION

**APA-Style Paper:** This text discusses the different sections of an APA-style research paper or lab report, with a focus on the Discussion section.

**Sections of an APA-Style Manuscript:** The paper outlines the following sections of an APA-style manuscript:

1. **Title page:** Includes the title, author name and affiliation, running head, and any necessary author notes.
2. **Abstract:** A brief summary (120 words or fewer) of the hypothesis, method, results, and implications of the work.
3. **Introduction:** Overview of the research question, review of relevant studies, and purpose and hypothesis of the present experiment.
4. **Method:** Description of participants, materials used, and procedure.
5. **Results:** Presentation of behavioral outcomes and statistical results without interpretation.
6. **Discussion:** Interpretation of findings, implications for understanding the research question, and suggestions for future research.
7. **References:** List of sources cited in alphabetical order using APA citation style.
8. **Table(s) and Figure(s):** Included as needed to explain the results.

**Discussion Section:** The Discussion section is an opportunity for authors to interpret their findings, place them in context, and suggest directions for future research. They may also discuss strengths and limitations of the study and any improvements that could be made.

**APA-Style Formatting:** Key formatting requirements include double-spacing throughout the paper, 12-point font, 1-inch margins on all sides, and numbered pages (except for figures). The first line of each paragraph is indented, and references appear in a hanging-indent format.

**Literature Reviews:** Literature reviews are psychology term papers that summarize what is known about a specific topic in psychology. They typically follow the basic outline of an APA-style paper but do not include Method or Results sections since they do not contain original experiments. Instead, they have three main parts: a topic overview, a review of specific topics and issues drawn from relevant studies, and a closing section that identifies main conclusions and suggests directions for future research.

### OTHER WRITING FORMATS

## CHAPTER 8: BUILDING DISTINCTION THROUGH HIGH-IMPACT PRACTICES (HIPS)

Sam, a recent psychology graduate, expressed regret for not taking advantage of opportunities to enhance his college experience beyond academics. He believed that missing out on an internship would prevent him from getting a job in his field. However, the lack of an internship doesn't necessarily hinder employment prospects; it just makes demonstrating competence more challenging.

**Challenges for Students**

Many students work while pursuing their degree, leaving little time for extracurricular activities that could make them more valuable to employers. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, approximately 40% of full-time students aged 16-24 worked in 2013, with just under 10% working a minimum of 35 hours per week.

**High-Impact Practices (HIPs)**

Pascarella and Terenzini suggest that successful undergraduates effectively balance academic, personal, and extracurricular pursuits. Kuh et al. recommend students engage in at least one HIP during their first year and another during their senior year. HIPs include opportunities like being part of a professor's research team or participating in community projects.

**Value of HIPs for Psychology Majors**

Participating in HIPs can lead to:

- Applying psychology concepts and principles in real-world settings
- Developing leadership skills
- Building relationships with potential recommenders
- Expanding your portfolio with impressive abilities and traits
- Demonstrating commitment to improving others' lives

**Making Strategic Decisions**

Students should consider their time carefully when choosing enrichment activities. Academic success is the primary priority, so avoid overcommitting to activities that may hinder academic performance. Jeremy's story illustrates the importance of balancing leadership opportunities with academics.

**High-Impact Practices in Psychology**

1. **Establishing and leading study groups:** This HIP directly supports academic growth and can help students develop leadership skills.
2. **Assisting in department activities:** Working as an assistant or volunteer in the psychology department can provide valuable experiences related to your major.
3. **Term abroad:** Studying abroad can broaden horizons, improve language skills, and build self-efficacy.
4. **Formal leadership positions:** Serving in student government, campus organizations, or community projects can lead to exceptional leadership experience but requires a significant time commitment.
5. **Research opportunities:** Participating in research projects with faculty members can deepen understanding of your chosen discipline and enhance your resume.
6. **Community service:** Volunteering in local organizations or initiatives can demonstrate your commitment to making a positive impact on others' lives.
7. **Internships:** Although Sam believed an internship was essential for employment, it is not the only pathway; however, gaining practical experience in your field can be beneficial.
8. **Study abroad programs with a psychology focus:** These programs offer academic and cultural experiences that can broaden your perspective and enhance your resume.
9. **Honors programs:** Participating in honors programs can challenge you academically and provide opportunities for research, leadership, and networking.
10. **Student organizations:** Joining psychology-related student organizations can help you build relationships with peers and professionals in your field.

### PRESENTING RESEARCH AT A CONFERENCE

Sharing research findings with others is an essential aspect of the research process. While writing a senior thesis or other paper achieves this goal, presenting research at a psychology conference enhances a graduate student's potential.

**Types of Conferences**

- Undergraduate conferences: offered by individual colleges or universities or consortia, where few text and an emphasis on tables and graphs are used to summarize the research project.
  - Poster sessions: lower-stress presentation mode with quick 2-minute summaries for interested attendees.
  - Oral presentations: talks where the speaker stands in front of an audience to present research for 15 or 20 minutes, requiring focus on hypothesis, methods, findings, and answering questions from the audience.

**Preparing for a Conference**

- Joining an organization: most conferences are sponsored by organizations (APA), requiring student affiliate membership for undergraduates to present.
- Submitting a conference proposal: must be reviewed and accepted, with research supervisor typically being a full member of the organization.
- Creating a poster or preparing an oral presentation: follow APA style, emphasizing visuals and clear communication.

**Benefits of Presenting at a Conference**

- Enhances potential as a graduate student: showcases research skills to peers and professionals.
- Valuable skill for graduate school and the workplace: public speaking, leading discussions, and presenting reports.

### A MAJOR SUCCESS STORY - FROM BA TO PSYD TO REHAB PSYCHOLOGIST

**Background:** Joann's Journey from BA to PSYD to Rehab Psychologist

* **Undergraduate Education:** Joann knew traditional clinical PhD pathway wasn't for her due to research requirements not aligning with her strengths.
* **Alternative: PsyD Degree:** Enrolled in a new and rigorous PsyD program, thrived during clinical training.
* **Clinical Training:** Gained experience with various populations; drawn to those facing physical challenges.
* **Rehabilitation Psychologist:** Collaborates with multidisciplinary team in trauma recovery (accidents, strokes).
* **Advice:** Networking and electives crucial for success in clinical programs.

**Challenges in Clinical Programs: Internships**

* **Emerging Problem:** Ensuring students have access to quality internships due to increasing numbers of PsyD-trained candidates from for-profit programs.
* **APA's Response:** Dedicating resources to increase the number of quality internships.
* **Internship Placement Success:** Clinical programs should report their students' success in obtaining appropriate internships after formal training.
* **Caution:** Be wary of programs with poor internship-match percentages; unaccredited placements limit professional credibility and job options.

**Applying to Graduate School: Number of Applications**

* **Application Fees:** Most graduate schools charge application fees, but some waive them for students with limited income.
* **Number of Applications:** No magic number; consider cost, desires, and chances of admission.
* **Realistic Appraisal:** Balance dreams with realistic expectations regarding program admissions.

### GRADES MATTER - AND SO DO TEST SCORES

**Grades and Test Scores in Graduate Programs**

* Undergraduate grades matter for admission to selective graduate programs
* Graduate schools examine students' GPAs in all courses, not just psychology major
* Minimum GPA requirement is usually 3.0, but competitive programs may require higher GPAs
* Most graduate programs in psychology require students to submit scores on the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) and the Psychology Subject Test
* GRE contains questions assessing verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and analytical writing
* Psychology Subject Test covers experimental and natural science sides, social science side, history of psychology, statistics, research methods, and applied psychology
* Official testing centers administer the tests by computer throughout the year
* Higher scores on both tests increase chances of admission to competitive graduate programs
* Some programs may not require GRE but might specify the Miller Analogies Test instead
* Prepare for both general and disciplinary tests with books, courses, or self-study
* Retake exams if disappointed with scores, but additional preparation is necessary for improved results

**Requesting Letters of Recommendation**

* Instructors, academic advisors, professors, former supervisors, and employers may be asked to write letters of recommendation or serve as references
* Provide recommenders with a list of addresses and due dates for letters, curriculum vitae (CV), résumé, personal statement, list of courses and grades, unofficial transcript, GRE scores, required recommendation forms, and preaddressed envelopes
* Many letters are now uploaded to university websites by recommenders themselves
* Waive your right to see confidential letters of recommendation to ensure candid assessments of abilities and character
* Follow up with graduate programs to make sure all recommenders have sent in their letters before deadlines.

### WRITING A PERSONAL STATEMENT
