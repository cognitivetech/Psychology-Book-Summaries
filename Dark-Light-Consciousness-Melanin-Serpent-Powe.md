# Dark Light Consciousness Melanin, Serpent Power, and the Luminous Matrix of Reality by Edward Bruce Bynum Ph D

> Within each of us lies the potential to activate a personal connection to the superconscious. Called “Ureaus” in ancient Egyptian texts and “Kundalini” in ancient Hindu yoga traditions, our innate serpent power of spiritual transcendence inhabits the base of the spine in its dormant state. When awakened, it unfurls along the spinal column to the brain, connecting individual consciousness to the consciousness of the universe enfolded within the dark matter of space. At the root of creativity and spiritual genius across innumerable cultures and civilizations, this intelligent force reveals portals that enfold time, space, and the luminous matrix of reality itself.
> 
> Combining physics, neuroscience, and biochemistry with ancient traditions from Africa and India, Edward Bruce Bynum, Ph.D., explores the ancient Egyptian science of the Ureaus and reveals how it is intimately connected to dark matter and to melanin, a light-sensitive, energy-conducting substance found in the brain, nervous system, and organs of all higher life-forms. He explains how the dark light of melanin serves as the biochemical infrastructure for the subtle energy body, just as dark matter, together with gravity, holds the galaxies and constellations together. With illustrated instructions, he shows how to safely awaken and stabilize the spiritual energy of the Ureaus through meditation practices, breathing exercises, and yoga postures as well as how to prepare the subtle body for transdimensional soul travel.

## INTRODUCTION GENESIS, DARK MATTERS, AND THE LEGACY OF THE STARS

**Introduction to Genesis, Dark Matters, and the Legacy of the Stars**

**Religion and Science**:
- Conjugated faces or phases of one complete act of knowledge
- Embrace past and future of evolution
- Can provide insight into the past and future

**The Current State of Reason and Faith**:
- Doubts about faith, God, meaning in life, even the living radiance that sustains life
- Some men of faith have descended into religious fanaticism
- Violence, dogma, and intolerance used against those who disagree

**The Path Forward**:
- Science, beauty, and moral genius can open a gateway out of this morass
- Humans are on the verge of exploring the cosmos in new ways
- Our science has become more integrated, expansive, and sublime

**Expanding the Concept of Evolution**:
- Evolution occurs on all planes of existence, not just earthbound life
- Child development and neonatology, as well as NDE research, show consciousness exists beyond physical birth and death
- Reality is ultimately transtemporal and transspatial, not limited to matter, space, and time

**Higher Dimensions of Consciousness**:
- We are embedded in higher dimensional spaces beyond the three we can physically experience
- Our conscious minds are projected into multiple dimensions
- Space and time become fluid in our dreams, a form of the fourth dimension

**The Interpenetration of Dimensions**:
- All dimensions interpenetrate each other in the heavens and on Earth
- Psychological and spiritual reality is at the root of our Being
- Consciousness pervades all dimensions of the energetic world

**Rejecting Elitism**:
- Appeals to ultimate reality accessible only to a select class of "priests" is rejected
- The approach will be experiential, not as priests, but as psychologists

**The Limitations of Current Psychology**:
- Focused on mid-range of human consciousness and the ego
- This notion of the unconscious has become reductive, lacking a forward unfolding dynamism or telos

### "A Holistic View of Consciousness: Connecting Psychology, Spirituality, and Neuroscience"

**Expanding Beyond Ego: Understanding Consciousness and the Superconscious**
- Explore higher unfoldment of superconscious (above ego) through quiet reflection and ancient wisdom
- Skepticism about persistent mystical claims has been addressed by experiments in lucid dreaming, neurogenesis, and consciousness studies before and after death
- Consciousness is nonlocal; not bound by physical distances or time

**Background:**
- Psychologists have studied the unconscious through methods like slips of tongue, free association, and dreams
- Need to expand understanding to superconscious realms
- Both require different methodologies

**Connection Between Body, Mind, and Cosmos:**
- Brain and body energies connected to consciousness
- Not dissociated from God or realms of spirit
- Higher wisdom can be found in ancient texts of Egypt, India, Tibet

**Modern Science and Ancient Knowledge:**
- Skepticism about persistent mystical claims replaced by scientific discoveries
- Life did not originate on Earth but came from interstellar meteors/comets
- Consciousness present before and after death in some subtle form

**Understanding through Different Perspectives:**
- Each chapter explores spiritual understanding from a different perspective
- Establishes basis of work in bodies and dynamic earth (Part 1)
- Intimate experiences of dimensions accessible to human consciousness
- Rooted in immediate experiences, not just faith or belief

**Connection Between Spiritual Practice and Physical World:**
- Bridge between spiritual practice and physical world
- Harness one to influence the other: neuromulin vs. psychospiritual dynamism
- Universal wellspring in diversity of cultures and religions

**Common Origin:**
- Evolutionary matrix for luminous transformation in Earth and bodies
- Common origin through ancient ancestors and shared neural network.

### Exploring Dark Matter Consciousness in Human Evolution

**The Interconnected Nature of Our Being**

**Brains, Organ Systems, and Subtle Nervous Systems**:
- Bind us together in an intimate, mysterious way
- This book will explore the outline of our perennial science of spirituality through this common gateway between our innermost regions and the stars

**Exploring Spiritual Bounty**:
- A "gardener with a free spirit" can explore the spiritual bounty grown in our search for the living god
- Different techniques, methods, maps, and schools are directed at finding a way to stop the mind
- When the mind is stopped or fixed, our local consciousness or "I" is dissolved, and the higher nonlocal roots of consciousness become apparent

**The Body and the Mind**:
- The body is external to the mind, but the mind is also "external" to the indwelling spirit, which is all pervasive
- Realizing this is the goal
- Different schools use a selected body of techniques to craft a melody consonant with the age and historical-cultural context

**An Empirical, Evidence-Based Methodology**:
- This book will present an empirical, evidence-based methodology rooted in yoga but not limited to this particular method
- It will provide a basic practice (a spinal flex kriya) as a first step, which will be greatly expanded in later chapters

**The Living Interconnected Web of Life on Earth**:
- The living interconnected web of life on Earth or Gaia is real
- Gaia enfolds the Earth and extends into the vast darkness of interstellar space
- This unseen reality is composed of a mysterious dark matter that, together with space-folding gravity, holds the constellations together
- Carbon-based life-forms are expressed through the universal dark biochemical processes of melanin and neuromelanin

**The Biological Significance of Surface Differences**:
- Surface or "mere skin" racial typing within the human species is a phenotypic permutation of small consequence in the ocean of genetic and biological similarity
- However, we share this subtle bioluminescence and bioelectrical aspect of our nervous systems

**The Coiling Ureaus and DNA**:
- The coiling Ureaus is reflected in the mysterious double helix of DNA
- The Earth is covered with living systems that coil and curl with the living structure of DNA
- This "close and holy darkness" of the evolutionary process in melanin and DNA is intimately connected to our own inner darkness and the vast darkness of the cosmos

**Dark Matter Consciousness**:
- Dark matter is related symbolically to the unconscious, as it is not directly seen but we encounter its effect upon our world
- This modern unconscious is a permutation of the ancient concept of the Primeval Waters of Nun and the living psychic Amenta of ancient Kemetic Egypt

### Indigenous African Roots of Ureaus and Psychological Technologies

**Understanding the Dynamic Unconscious**

**Ancestors' Perception of the Unconscious**:
- Enfolded both psychic and physical-energetic world
- Rooted in genetic and DNA inheritance from early Homo sapiens sapiens
- Memory, information, and intelligence were nonlocally enfolded in a collective process

**The Concept of Ureaus**:
- Descended from ancient Djehdi masters of Kemetic Egypt
- Represents indigenous African peoples who created the first known civilization
- Associated with spiral patterns seen in DNA, Earth's core, and neuromagnetic nerves

**Shamanic Beliefs and Seizures**:
- Shamans and ancient peoples believed seizures were signs from the gods
- Temporal lobe epilepsy may reflect deeper aspects of human organism and connection to Earth
- Experiences leading to unusual psychic and psychological phenomena

**The Wisdom of Kemetic Civilization**:
- Guardian of sacred wisdom for over ten thousand years
- Linked with Indus valley civilizations in symbols and lineages of Ureaus
- Held knowledge about stars, soul, and heavens

**Embracing the Living Darkness**:
- Overcoming collective Westernized conditioning and fear
- Embracing the living darkness that enfolds the light

**Psychotechnologies from Ancient Civilizations**:
- Explored psychological dynamics of this current of living energy
- Fragments of ancient psychotechnologies survive long after the Deluge

**Human Evolution and Metallurgy**:
- Standard model of human evolution places Homo sapiens sapiens at 150,000 to 200,000 years old
- Metallurgy developed around 7000 BCE

## PART ONE: Darkness and Light

"Evolution of Life and Mind is explained by the Vedantic concept that Life, inherent in Matter and Consciousness.  Therefore, mental consciousness could be a veil for higher states beyond Mind."

### 1. MEDICAL BACKGROUND TO THE PERENNIAL SCIENCE OF HOW DARKNESS ENFOLDS THE LIGHT

**Evolution of Brain: How Darkness Enfolds Light**

**Background:**
- Imagination more important than knowledge (Einstein)
- Evolution not opposed to God, but His expression (author's perspective)
- Two realms of science and religion converge in understanding brain evolution

**Brain Evolution:**
1. Gradual increase in capacity for light absorption due to increasing brain melanin or neuromelanin
2. Progressive folding and enfolding, leading to greater receptivity and flexibility
3. Three stages: reptilian brain stem, primitive mammalian midbrain, advanced mammalian cortex, and neocortex in humans (triune brain)
4. Brain development occurs in three-and-a-half coils over the spine
5. Brain stem: spinal cord rising into the brain, contains ni-grostriatal nerve tract and vital nuclei for movement regulation
6. Limbic system: emerging from midbrain, supports emotions and filters intelligence (amygdala, hippocampus, inferior temporal lobe, hypothalamus)
7. Circulating ventricles contain circumventricular organs with neuromelanin sites
8. Overlapping functions begin to process true intelligence and consciousness at this level
9. Brain adapts to wider nonlocal consciousness but does not fully express it
10. Cortex emerges, shared with more complex mammals for advanced processing capabilities.

#### Understanding Melanin's Role in Brain Evolution and Consciousness Development

**Brain Evolution: The Emergence of the Neocortex**

**Neocortex**
- New aspect of brain in higher evolution
- Quantum leap beyond limbic system and cortex
- Capable of subtle emotional modulation, temporal calculations, executive functions
- Reaches from concentrated "Black Dot" to dynamics of dark energy expanding space-time
- Covered with gray-black pigmented sheath of neuromelanin cells

**Brain Structure**
- Three and a half folds over spinal cord: brain stem, limbic system, neocortex
- Parallels three and a half coils of serpent in perennial traditions
- Union and awakening is marriage of science and spirit
- Neuromelanin involved in brain's evolutionary folding and perception of unfolding space
- Universal human experience, present in each individual regardless of ethnicity or background

**Neuromelanin**
- Deep structure phenomenon
- Involved in subliminal detection of Earth's geodynamic torque
- Reflection of wider process: folding and enfolding of space itself
- Found in internal organs, especially heart, lungs, kidneys, GI tract
- Transduces energy from one state to another (vibration to sound, heat, light)
- Interacts with electromagnetic field, becomes template for capacity to vibrate with fifth-dimensional forces
- Shape: tetrahedron or pyramid, associated with pyramid and "om" sound

**Central Nervous System (CNS)**
- Directly gives rise to brain stem and spinal cord
- Forms virtual template of potential and actualized states of consciousness
- Melanin guides development and unfoldment of CNS, PNS, ANS.

#### THE HIDDEN CURRENTS OF GAIA

**The Hidden Currents of Gaia**

**Interconnected Life on Earth:**
- Ancient belief: all life is sacred and interconnected
- Modern materialism has led to ecological issues
- Impact of solar system's passage through denser region of space affecting planets, including Earth

**Earth's Core and Surface Forces:**
- Titanic gravitational and electromagnetic forces within the core
- Interconnected with interstellar depths of the cosmos
- Influence on life currents and web of living beings on the surface

**Ecological Cycles:**
- Seasons, eons: rotations that change life, consciousness, civilizations
- All contain DNA: common substance for all life forms
- Interacting with heartbeat of Earth (Schumann resonance)

**Schumann Resonance:**
- Standing waves in the cavity between Earth's surface and ionosphere
- Low electromagnetic frequencies: 7.8 Hz, harmonics at 14, 20, 26, 33, 39, 45 Hz
- Entrainment with mammalian and human organisms, especially nervous system and heart aorta system
- Implications for health and consciousness

**Melanin:**
- Light-absorbing pigments found in biosphere, lithosphere, atmosphere, and local cosmos
- In critical areas of nigrostriatual column: neuromelanin
- Highly sensitive to light, movement, energy transformations, terrestrial magnetism

**Ancient Knowledge:**
- Egyptians codified natural laws in Shabaka stone from Twenty-fifth Dynasty
- Knew about transformative evolutionary forces within Earth's core.

#### THE ANATOMY OF THE EARTH AND THE HUMAN NERVOUS SYSTEM

**The Anatomy of the Earth and the Human Nervous System**

**Earth's Layers:**
- Outer crust: thin, brittle layer, about 40 km deep
- Upper mantle: solid rock, roughly 40-670 km below surface
- Lower mantle: solid rock, extending from 670 to around 2,890 km
- Liquid outer core: dense iron, about 2,260 km in depth
- Solid sphere of iron: approximately the size of the moon, at the core's center

**Earth's Core Rotation:**
- Spin generates geodynamic effects and geomagnetic lines/waves to surface
- Slight wobble (precession) caused by Earth's axis shifting due to core rotation

**Ancient Perception of Precession:**
- Known as the Great Year, approximately 26,000 years long
- Root perception in ancient cultures: Great Pyramid, Vedas, Mayans

**Megalithic Yard and Earth's Spin:**
- Measurement system used in megalithic structures (Britain, France)
- Based on 366 degrees to match Earth's rotations per year
- Precise linear measurement: 82.966656 cm

**Earth's Inner Core:**
- Density is at least thirteen times that of water
- Mass is over a million million million tons, 30% greater than moon's

**Generation of Geomagnetic Field:**
- Unknown mechanism, likely convection current in fluid outer core
- Electric currents and magnetic field arise from iron-rich conducting fluid

**Earth's Magnetic Field Protection:**
- Shields the Earth from solar winds and galactic particles
- Without it, Earth might lose atmosphere and become a dead planet like Mars

**Magnetic Reversals:**
- Fluctuating magnetic field has weakened over past 300 years
- Occurs approximately every 200,000 years with 300 years of shifting in between
- Multiple poles moving across the Earth during weakening periods.

#### CONSCIOUSNESS AND ENERGY IN THE SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM

**The Relationship Between Consciousness, Energy, and the Space-Time Continuum**

**Coiling Torque and Geomagnetic Field**:
- A kind of coiling torque is applied by the spinning inner core within the generated geomagnetic field
- Under certain conditions, this coil is detectable by human consciousness

**Gravity and Electromagnetism**:
- Gravity warps the fabric of space-time, and is experientially woven into the loom of human consciousness
- Neuromelanin in strategic regions of the brain and along the brain stem is rich in iron and subject to subtle magnetism influences

**Electromagnetic Fields and the Earth's Subtle Energy System**:
- The dimensional interface between gravitational and electromagnetic forces probably has something to do with the structure and shape of space
- Subtle lines of force extending into space beyond the Earth are believed to be a kind of living nervous system for the Earth, similar to the meridian energy or chi/ki lines in acupuncture
- Ancient civilizations aligned temples, churches, graveyards, and other structures with these perceived "spirit pathways"

**Human Consciousness and Stellar Alignments**:
- Human consciousness interacts with these subtle energetic phenomena within the space-time continuum
- Some esoteric systems claim these subtle lines of force extend into space beyond the Earth in a planetary grid system
- Ancient civilizations observed galactic alignments, measurements of the Great Year, and other "scientific" feats without the aid of telescopes thousands of years ago

**The Geodynamic Process and Spiritual Destiny**:
- The geodynamic process, which is both electromagnetic and gravitational in nature, is directly experienced in human consciousness
- This geodynamic curvature of space may be partially how this subtle dynamic is subtly but directly perceived and experienced during meditation

#### TORQUE, TWIST, AND THE RISE OF THE SERPENT

**Torque, Twist, and the Rise of the Serpent**

**Inner Core Rotation**:
- The Earth's inner core rotates eastward at a faster rate than the surface
- Calculations suggest a range of 1 to 3 degrees per year difference in rotation speed
- This means the inner core makes about two-thirds to more than one full rotation per second faster than the surface
- The inner core traces a circular path around the North Pole, migrating to different locations on the Earth's surface and mantle over time

**Core Angular Momentum and Twist**:
- The difference in rotation speed between the core and surface creates an **angular momentum**, or **twist**, transferred to the mantle and surface through various torques (electromagnetic, gravitational, topographic, viscous)
- This subtle spiraling motion is perceived by the sensitive nervous system
- This twist is likely associated with the geomagnetic lines on the Earth's surface, as well as more subtle "ley lines" and lines of force in the Earth's grid system

**Perception of Spirals and Coils**:
- These perceived lines of force are likely associated with the natural geomagnetic field generated by the Earth's core rotation
- They can be seen in various forms, from growing plants to landscape designs, geological formations, and the human spine
- The perception and intuition of spirals and coils forms the basis of many psychospiritual disciplines (e.g., Taoism, kundalini yoga)

**The Inner Core and Perception**:
- The operation of the hidden geodynamic root of Gaia and its influence on evolutionary forces is beyond current conception
- What can be conceived and studied is the "I" or citadel of perception and attention

#### PSYCHOLOGY, PSYCHIATRY, AND THE MANY SHADES OF THE “I”

**Dissociation in Psychology and Psychiatry**

**Understanding Dissociation:**
- Phenomenon where "I" and body are not always identical or aligned
- Experienced as a separation between direct experience of "I" and physical body
- Can result in altered perception of time and space
- Clinically referred to as dissociative experiences

**Types of Dissociation:**

**Mild Dissociation (Derealization):**
- Feeling mildly out of sorts during acutely stressful situations
- World around us feels unreal, blurry, and dreamlike for short periods
- Adaptation or defense mechanism against more fearful sense of dissolution

**Moderate Dissociation (Depersonalization):**
- Sustained separation from emotional and psychological surroundings
- Feeling outside the situation, like watching oneself in a movie
- Inner personhood begins to feel distorted and unreality prevails

**Severe Dissociation:**
- Complete or full dissociation of sensations, memories, and experiences from conscious experience
- Not all dissociation is bad as long as it doesn't interfere with daily life

**Causes of Dissociation:**
- Traumatic events: physical abuse, sexual abuse, repeated neglect, chaotic family environment, disconnected relationships
- Creates a warp in the subtle living energy field associated with the nervous system
- Intense double-bind relationships leading to dissociative experience and chronic relational tension

**Dissociation in Clinical Context:**
- Can be observed in psychiatrically labeled experiences such as derealization and depersonalization
- Useful in clinical hypnosis for pain relief through strategic dissociation
- Reunification or realignment of the experiencing "I" with the physical body after the situational trauma passes.

##### The Multidimensional Nature of Consciousness in Dissociative Identity Disorder

**Psychopathology: Dissociative Disorders**
* Individuals experience debilitating anxiety leading to prolonged dissociation (not under their control)
* Active unconscious functioning spills over into behavior outside conscious awareness and recall
* Example: Fugue states
  + Person may travel, carry out activities, have no memory of what transpired
  + Separate memories, sensations, feelings, attitudes, even brain wave patterns
* Clinical techniques used for reintegration of personality (hypnosis, EMDR)
  + Aid in intersystem communication between subselves or "alters"
  + Address trauma initiating splitting/repression

**Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)**
* Personality constellation with separate memories, experiences, associations, use of voice, even brain wave patterns within the same person
* Subpersonalities may not be aware of each other
* Some developed more than others or locked into separate developmental eras marked by trauma
* Each subpersonality encodes information and stores it separately, goes down different developmental tracts

**Fugue States**
* Conscious, socially engaged while in another place/narrative
* Amnesia for experience upon returning
* Relative to dissociated consciousness, daily life is amnesic
* Occurs when self-consciousness descends into episode from which other is then relative
* Experience of fugue state as dream: dissociated from daily life

**Primordial Dissociation**
* Birth trauma causes separation or dissociation from deeper reality
* Essential goal of wisdom traditions: remember/re-member deeper Self
* Human Self processes regions of dissociative experience from a higher, more enfolded dimension.

**The Upanishads**:
- Chan Docyas' teachings: "transcends all material relation and becoming, regains his own Self - the Absolute"
- Beyond mortality, fear, and physical existence
- The Absolute is Truth

**The Egyptian Book of the Dead (Papyrus of Ani)**:
- Translations include "Book of Coming Forth by Day and Going Forth by Night"
- Associates light with spirit in various spiritual traditions

**Kemetic Egyptian Tradition**:
- Bird-bodied ba associated with breath, spiritual flight, and transformation
- Primal images of transformation across shamanic traditions

**Misunderstanding of Ancient Texts**:
- Egyptologists viewed them as mere mythology or superstitious gibberish
- Due to implicit understanding of matter as localized and atomistic
- Racism towards the indigenous peoples' psychological paradigms

**Expanded Matrix of Connectivity**:
- Matter as transtemporal, transspatial, quantum mechanically interpenetrating
- Causally non-local dynamics of consciousness
- Ancient texts provide a lost psychotechnology using different epistemology and expanded conception of space, time, matter, and consciousness

**Hermetic Principles**:
- Mentalism: "all that exists is mental"
- Theoretical physics' confession: everything is a permutation of energy and light
- The Absolute as the fundamental reality, consciousness itself

**Light as a Form of Energy and Vibration**:
- Light is the medium of the sea of seen and unseen energy
- Light is the vibration of a fifth dimension
- We are enfolded in higher dimensions and vibrations

**Spiritual Statement by Christ**:
- "When the I is single, the body is full of light"
- Not only a spiritual statement, but a hidden methodology

#### THE DYNAMICS OF OBJECTIVE LIGHT

**The Dynamics of Objective Light**

**Light as Compressed Matter**:
- Matter is a form of compressed light
- Light is the underlying structure and process of our physical bodies
- Exists in various expressions, from quantum to molecular/mountain scale
- Has dual nature: wave and particle

**Matter Representations**:
- Mass-point or particle representation
- Continuum or wave through space
- Measure of strength or intensity in a pure field

**Superluminal Nature of Light**:
- Certain "particles" move faster than the speed of light
- Some phenomena can slow down to the speed of light
- Aspects of light can be superluminal, at normal speed, or below light speed

**Dimensional Representation of Light**:
- Rooted in ancient mystical traditions and contemporary science
- Unification of electromagnetism and gravity through a fifth dimension
- Kaluza-Klein theory: added 5th dimension to unify gravity and electromagnetism
- Incorporated into string theory as a 5th dimensional force

**Implications for Consciousness**:
- We experience light and electromagnetism in our world
- These forces meet at a dimensional juncture in human consciousness
- Beyond the 3/4 physical dimensions, we have intuition, illumination, and logical senses to perceive higher dimensions

#### THE DYNAMICS OF SUBJECTIVE LIGHT

**The Dynamics of Subjective Light**

**Light as the Ground of Reality**:
- Light has both objective and subjective nature
- Objective light manifests as various forms (sunlight, moonlight, electromagnetism, etc.)
- Subjective light is experienced in dreams, prayer/meditation, intuition, and inner self

**Unification of the Realms**:
- The different energies of the objective and subjective worlds become unified at higher levels of vibration
- This is the level of the nonlocal aspect of consciousness itself

**Laws and Dynamics of Objective Light**:
- Physics studies the objective realm of light and quantum phenomena
- These have specific laws and dynamics that can be observed or measured

**Laws and Dynamics of Subjective Light**:
- Psychosomatic methodologies reveal the subjective realm of light
- This includes vibratory phenomena, states of consciousness, and spiritual experiences
- The wavelengths of this subjective light encode vast amounts of information about the multidimensional and spiritual nature of light

**Consciousness in Quantum Mechanics**:
- Currents within quantum mechanics suggest the observer influences the behavior of particles
- Relativity implicitly recognizes the observer and factors it into the equation

**The Cosmic Perspective**:
- In the cosmos of the infinitely small, consciousness is irreducible
- In the realm of the stupendously large, the observer's presence is implicit
- The innumerable processes between these realms sense a tacit observer or awareness

**Conclusion**:
- It is only cultural bias that keeps us from acknowledging the "mental" nature of reality
- Quantum physics can be made rigorous with consciousness itself

#### THE PRINCIPLE OF IMMORTALITY

**The Principle of Immortality**

**We are a young species**:
- Yet we have evolved to realize that part of us is imbued in a timeless milieu

**Consciousness and the Dimensions of Existence**:
- The 3rd dimension of physical space and 4th dimension of time wrap us in the flesh of mortality
- Consciousness, as the observer, is not limited to these dimensions
- Space and time are inextricably linked in the dimension of space-time
- Relativity reveals that space-time can be rotated into other dimensions

**The Principle of Immortality**:
- Light is best understood as both an energetic force and a 5th-dimensional vibration
- Light uses space and time to manifest itself, not limited by them
- Our subjective experiences and spiritual nature are manifestations of our vibratory expression in the 5th dimension

**Consciousness as the Ground**:
- Consciousness itself is the ground or field of enfolding and interconnected links in the 5th dimension of light
- Tunnels and runnels of light connect vast stretches of space-time
- All things in the universe are connected by way of information and consciousness

**The Principle of Immortality as Eternal Dwellers**:
- The ancestors dwell eternally in the realm of light, beyond the 3-dimensional physical world
- Luminous beings can emerge from within or outside ourselves, transcending our mortal selves
- This dimension moves in and out of our 3-dimensional reality and time, experienced as blissful or awe-inspiring

**The Electromagnetic Connection**:
- The electromagnetic capacities and sympathies of melanin and neuromelanin are intimately related to this vibrational field
- We directly experience the electromagnetic force in this 5th dimension, feeling gravity as a distortion of space-time.

## Part TWO: Embodiment through the Anatomy of the Sleeping Serpent

**Embodiment through the Anatomy of the Sleeping Serpent**

**Paramahansa Yogananda**:
- Distinctions by race or nation are meaningless in the realm of truth
- The only qualification is spiritual fitness to receive

**SPECT Scans**:
- Suggested another possibility:
  - The orientation area was working unusually but not improperly
  - Evidence of the brain's capacity to make spiritual experience real

**Neurological Process**:
- Believed to have evolved to allow humans to transcend material existence
- Connect with a deeper, more spiritual part of ourselves perceived as an absolute, universal reality that connects us to all that is
- Located in the posterior superior parietal lobe, a small lump of gray matter nestled in the top rear section of the brain

**Andrew Newberg, Eugene D'Aquilo, Vince Rause**:

#### THE BODILY AXIS OF THE SPINE

**The Bodily Axis of the Spine**

**Brain and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)**:
- The brain, with its four ventricles and flowing CSF, is the most complex interface with physical reality
- Hidden within the brain may lie our evolutionary path beyond the current unfoldment
- This evolutionary energy is the life current harnessed by yoga through various techniques

**The Spine (Vertebral Column)**:
- The spine is a living symphony of bone that has evolved from fish to reptiles, birds, and mammals
- It is the axis mundi of man and the world
- Composed of calcium salts deposited in protein fibers, providing flexibility and strength
- Protects the spinal cord and nerve roots
- Provides a schemata for attachments like ligaments, tendons, and muscles
- Supports the head, shoulders, chest, midsection, and organs
- Provides balance, distributes weight, and modulates gravity
- Provides for flexibility to expand and grow
- Houses red blood cells and stores vital minerals

**Spinal Cord Layers**:
- **Dura Mater**: The outer gray layer, like the brain's dura mater, is permeated with blood
- **Subarachnoid Space**: The innermost space filled with CSF
- **Pia Mater**: A highly vascular membrane that provides nourishment to neural structures

**Cervical, Thoracic, Lumbar, Sacrum, and Coccyx Regions**:
- Each region has a separate number of vertebrae (7, 12, 5 or 6, 5 fused, 3 fused)
- The sacral region is crucial in psychospiritual techniques for stimulating the genitourinary complex

**Intervertebral Discs**:
- Separate each vertebra to absorb shock and protect nerves

**Spinal Nerves**:
- 31 pairs of spinal nerves (8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, 1 coccygeal)
- The brain has 12 cranial nerves (5 motor, 3 sensory, 4 both)

#### BRAIN STEM NEUROMELANIN

**Brain Stem Neuromelanin Development**

**Embryonic Development:**
- Brain arises from neurotube and neurocrest in early stages
- Guided by light-sensitive current due to melanin properties
- Spinal cord and higher brain structures develop

**Neuromelanin:**
- Emerges later in brain development
- Conducts information in self-aware organism
- Attracts light, crude outer sheath of bioluminescence

**Third Ventricle (Brahma-Rendra):**
- Classical location: third ventricle or above brain stem
- Vibration and resonance create virtual organ in inner connections of cavities
- Confusion due to different experiences among practitioners
- Entire region rich in neuromelanin, including the thalamus, hypothalamus, and plexus of third choroid ventricles

**Twelve Neuromelanin Foci:**

**Brain Stem Region:**
- Implicates vestibular system with nerves and labyrinth as well as higher midbrain structures
- Detection of subtle movement within the body and on Earth is crucial.

#### LABYRINTH OF THE DEEP BRAIN CORE

**Brain Structure: The Inner Labyrinth**
* Description of brain core as a series of interconnected chambers or cavities filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
* Four main chambers: lateral ventricles, third ventricle, and fourth ventricle
* CSF production in lateral, third, and fourth ventricles by choroids plexus
* Flow of CSF from lateral to third and then to fourth ventricicle through cerebral aqueduct
* Fourth ventricle connects with central canal of upper spinal cord through Luschka and Magendie openings
* CSF absorbed into bloodstream in superior sagittal sinus
* Two significant glands located within the core: pineal and pituitary

**Pineal Gland**
* Light-sensitive organ, also known as the "Sun dwelling in darkness"
* Located between the two hemispheres, attached to posterior end of root of third ventricle
* Size of a pea, cone shaped, gray to red-gray color
* Converts central nervous system signals into endocrine activity
* Secretes visionary or hallucinogenic hormones like DMT and melatonin
* Regulates sleep cycle through melatonin secretion
* Yogic disciplines stimulate growth of new neural cells in other regions of the brain, creating a new level of evolutionary unfoldment.

**Pituitary Gland**
* Also called the "master gland"
* Located at base of brain in small bony cavity (sella turcica)
* Divided into anterior and posterior lobes, with a third intermediate lobe in lower life forms
* Regulates various organ systems, sexuality, growth hormones, endorphins, prolactin, TSH or thyroid stimulating hormone, among others.
* Partially regulated by hypothalamus.

### 4. THE EYE, EVOLUTION, AND THE PINEAL GLAND

**The Eye, Evolution, and the Pineal Gland**

**Fascination with Light**:
- Humans have been fascinated by light since ancient times
- The single "I" and the "all-seeing eye" are dominant forces in religion and spirituality
- Esoteric references to light appear in ancient literature and art

**The Eye and Pineal Gland**:
- The eye is a keen scientific and spiritual instrument for deciphering the meaning of stars
- The pineal gland, shaped like a cone, rests in the upper brain near the midsection
- It has neural connections with the retina that account for its photosensitivity
- Over evolutionary development, the pineal gland has descended deeper into the skull and brain cavity

**The Pineal Gland and Spirituality**:
- The pineal gland is a transducer of light and a biological clock that regulates the system
- Light from the retina is relayed to the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus, which connects to the pineal gland
- The pineal gland is associated with the capacity to "see within" spiritually
- Pineal gland calcification may be linked to a descent into materialism and materialist philosophy

**The Present Materialistic World**:
- Our age is the most materialistic in history, rejecting traditional spiritual intuition
- The pineal gland, constantly moving in the waves of cerebral spinal fluid, picks up subtle vibrations and energies

### 5. THE INNER EAR MELANIN, VIBRATION, SOUND AND PERCEPTION, AND THE NOSE

**The Inner Ear, Melanin, Vibration, Sound, and Perception**

**The Role of the Ear**
- Conduits for sound from the wider environment into the brain
- Inner ear consists of fine hairs and structures that pick up vibrations and translate them into hearing

**Anatomy of the Inner Ear**
- Three structures: hammer, anvil, stirrup
- Transduction of energy from vibration to sound
- Melanin involved in this process

**Melanin in the Inner Ear**
- Located primarily in inner ear structures at junctions influencing sound and equilibrium (vestibulocochlear system)
- Discovered as far back as 1851
- Derived from early neural crest cells during embryological development
- Situated in utricle, saccule, endolymphatic duct and sac, modiolus, and endolymphatic sac
- Connects directly to semicircular canals for balance

**Vibration and Sound**
- The world is vibration and sound
- Melanin involved in transducing energy from vibration to sound
- Clinical applications: sonograms, audiology techniques
- Metaphysical and spiritual implications: use of mantra, tonoscope, and pyramid shapes (Sri Yantra)

**Sound Manipulation**
- Sonic weapons using sound and vibration
- Every shape has a corresponding sound in the projective geometry of space-time.

#### THE NOSE

**The Nose: The Underrated Sensory System**

**Development of Smell:**
- Early developing sensory system for mammals, birds, reptiles, and aquatic creatures
- Humans have a less developed but highly cognitive ability to use it

**Structure:**
- Nasal septum, sinus areas, turbinates
- Bioelectrical transduction of information through melanin-implicated structures within the head and body

**Melanin and Melanocytes in the Nose:**
- Associated with tumors but also play a subtle bioelectrical role
- Olfactory bulb and pyriform cortex are centers of smell, part of primitive limbic system

**Role of Smell:**
- Adaptive for survival: detection of food, sex, and danger
- Bioelectrical activity transmitted to central nervous system through olfactory nerves

**Smell and Emotions:**
- Involved in perception of fear, gustatory sensations, and sexual stimulation
- Communicates with other systems through a living bioconductivity based on melanin and neuromelanin within the body's structures.

## PART THREE: The Inner Preparation

Yoga's first prerequisites:  
- No causing harm to living beings. 
- Speaking truth. 
- Non-stealing. 
- Restraint (continence). 
- Cultivate compassion and strength. 
- Be merciful and honest. 
- Moderation in eating, purity of heart.

Yoga's second requirements:
- Self-limitations.
- Cheerfulness.
- Religious faith.
- Charity.
- Contemplation.
- Sacred scripture listening. 
- Modesty. 
- Clean mind.
- Mantra recitation.
- Rule observance. 


**The key takeaway is:**  True liberation from suffering requires recognizing the unity of Self, not just following rituals or worship. This is a core teaching found in both Yoga texts (Svatmarama's Hatha Yoga Pradipika) and the Upanishads.

### 6. THE PROCESS OF PROJECTION

**The Process of Projection**

**Introduction**:
- The mind's transition from one idea to another is like a "native condition" of the Self
- Projection has a dual nature, both objective and subjective
- Projection manifests in the physical world and in direct experience

**Projection as Light**:
- Projection has an external, physical manifestation like light
- Projection also has an internal, subjective manifestation
- Projection has both particle and wave properties

**Psychological Projection**:
- There are many forms of psychological projection
- Psychological projection is a common everyday experience
- It can be explored through the allegory of Plato's "Cave"
- Recognizes that this four-dimensional world is a projection from a deeper, enfolded reality

**Objective Projection**:
- The objective nature of projection will be examined first

#### THE OBJECTIVE NATURE OF PROJECTION

**The Objective Nature of Projection**

**Unification of Space-Time Geometry**:
- Discovery of 4th-dimensional space-time continuum was a transformative moment in science
- Marked the transcendence of Euclidean geometry and emergence of non-Euclidean geometries and topology
- **Euclidean geometry** mastered forms in three dimensions, rooted in ancient Egypt
- **Space-time geometry**: transformations occur in higher dimensions, with a geometric conception of unification
- **Lorenz transformations**: shift within a field that conserves energy
- **Super symmetry**: all forces interact and exchange energy while maintaining underlying relationships

**Higher Dimensional Unification**:
- Theoreticians propose 9, 11, or 22 dimensions in the universe
- Kaluza-Klein's 5th-dimensional unification of electromagnetism and gravity is mathematically elegant
- **Vibration** notion found in both contemporary theories and ancient traditions
- GUTs propose bringing in the dimension of consciousness itself

**Conformational Invariance**:
- Present in physical theories, but a principle of nature not confined to the physical world
- Retained through dream states, deep meditation, death, and travel through higher dimensions

#### PROJECTION IN MEDICINE

**Projection in Medicine**

**Referred Pain**:
- Physical symptoms felt in a different area than where they originated

**Neurological Projection**:
- Stimulation of sensory and motor neurons in the brain's precentral and postcentral gyrus
- Results in a "homunculus" - an outline of the physical body in the sensory and motor aspects of the brain
- Surgical stimulation can result in a projection of feeling, sensation, and experience to another part of the body

**Deafferentation**:
- Selective restraint of stimulation in the higher cortical areas
- Can lead to temporary dissolution of capacity for ego sensory and temporal orientation
- Resulting in a disorientation of psychological boundaries, sense of self, and projection of "I" to different regions of space and time
- Ultimately leading to dissolution of experiential categories of space and time

#### PSYCHIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROjECTION

**Psychic and Psychological Projection**

**Projective Assessment**:
- Basis of psychological testing (Rorschach, Holtzmann, TAT, DAP)
- Measures dynamic emotional material outside conscious awareness

**Projection Mechanism**:
- Mapping the unconscious
- Displacement and projection in:
  - Psychological experiences
  - Racism, anti-Semitism, etc.

**Powerful Forms of Projection**:
- Central to many disturbing social disorders
- Examples: racism, anti-Semitism, negative stereotypes

**Psychopathology of Projection**:
- Disowning one's own experience
- Normal vs. extreme forms of displacement and projection
  - Dissociation, depersonalization, derealization
  - Multiple personalities, fugue states

**Cryptoamnesia Examples**:
- Origins of "Platonic" solids
- Belief that Hebrew slaves built the pyramids

#### PSYCHIC AND SPIRITUAL PROJECTION

**Psychic and Spiritual Projection**

**Experiences Beyond Contemporary Understanding**:
- Some forms of projection are real and enduring but defy contemporary psychiatric and psychological understanding
- Experiences involving Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) reveal human potentials that are not pathological
    - Electrical stimulation and vibration floods into the temporal lobe, opening up the mind to other dimensions
    - Sense of self or "I" sense moving through a curved or rotating hyperdimensional space, exiting the physical body
- Similar to extreme experiences associated with dissociation, depersonalization, derealization, hallucinatory phenomena, and experiences induced by powerful hallucinogenic medications during spiritual disciplines (e.g., shamanic practices)

**Psychic Projection Experiences**:
- **Bilocation and remote viewing**: Forms of psychic projection verified in trained subjects
- Accurate reporting of distant events/objects cannot be reduced to brain stimulation alone
- Related but different from Out-of-Body Experience (OBE) phenomena

**Shamanic Techniques**:
- Shamans can consciously open a "kind of Einstein-Rosen Bridge" through higher dimensional curved space-time, reaching another plane or location
- Electromagnetic and gravitational coupling in the Earth's core rotational dynamics may provide a matrix for this travel

**Symbolic Projection**:
- The self, memory, and subjective "I" experience are not only in the neurons of the brain but in the space/energy field between synaptic junctures
- Energy is inherently trans-temporal and trans-spatial, or nonlocal
- Meditation aims to realize that beneath language, imagery, thought, and conception, there is a primordial Clear Light of radiant consciousness

#### CLASSICAL METHODS OF MIND-BODY SEPARATION

**Classical Methods of Mind-Body Separation**

**Separating the "I" from Physical Body:**
- Human evolution has led to conscious methods that separate psychological attention from physical body
- Not identifying or limiting "I" with physical body or brain
- Esoteric traditions facilitated this separation through rituals and experiences like OBE, dissociative episodes, communion with the dead

**Intentional Inducing Separation:**
- Some cultures used extreme methods: burying devotees with snakes, hallucinogenic drugs, or terror
- More gentle methods include stimulation of vestibular system or electrical/decreased blood flow to brain areas

**Techniques for Strategic Relaxation and Projection:**
1. Emotionally prepare:
   - Desire and commitment to experience
   - Examine doubts, fears, cultural values
2. Physically comfortable place:
   - Comfortable seat or recline
   - Low lighting, quiet, warm environment
   - Loose clothing
3. Agree to return to problems after the procedure is over
4. Progressive relaxation of body:
   - Relaxing each part with deep exhalations
5. Breathing technique:
   - Diaphragmatic breathing with extended exhalation phase
6. Visualization methods:
   * Method A: Focus on fear release, protection, and floating sensation
   * Method B: Use number visualization to relax into astral body consciousness.

- Observe hypnagogic imagery as "war against sleep"
- Transform into image of bird (ba) taking flight
- Deepen state of fluid relaxation
- Focus on space in front, pull consciousness towards it
- Experience fear, derealization, disorientation, and depersonalization
- Cultivate clear intention to leave body
- Project self out of physical body in small steps
- Rotate body slowly within static physical form

**Interpretations:**
- Soul principal projected from dense body into realm of energy and vibration
- Sensations of movement are an illusion, space and time adjust to soul
- Body enfolded in consciousness, not all of consciousness is enfolded in the body.

**Historical Context:**
- Preparation for ecstatic "exit" from body seen in Lascaux cave drawings (15,000 BCE) and Egyptian Osiris texts (before 3500 BCE)
- Spiritual seekers experienced fifth dimension of light itself beyond three dimensions of space and fourth dimension of time.

#### THE PYRAMID, THE TETRAHEDRON, AND SPIRITUAL FLIGHT

**The Pyramid, Tetrahedron, and Spiritual Flight**

**Platonic Solids**:
- The pyramid or triangular shape is one of the five Platonic solids
- It fills out all three physical dimensions
- Crucial to the manifestation of the Sri Yantra

**Sri Yantra**:
- A physical manifestation of the sound "om"
- Represents the "zero-point energy field" or vacuum underlying time and space
- Enfolds and contains the seven classical chakras and nine entrances/exits of the body
- When all exits are closed, the visual manifestation of "om" becomes manifest

**Tetrahedron**:
- The tetrahedral shape arises from the Sri Yantra
- Symbolic of the male and female principles in union
- Traditionally the higher symbol of the merkabah, a symbolic chariot of interdimensional travel

**Cube**:
- Another fundamental three-dimensional shape
- Constructing and deconstructing it in meditation can create a perceptual shift

**Embeddedness of Dimensions**:
- The cube is embedded in lower dimensional cubes, expanding into four dimensions
- Relevant to understanding the structures and processes of the cosmos and the human nervous system

**Spiritual Projection**:
- Involution: Descent into the three-dimensional spatial world and fourth-dimensional space-time
- Evolution: Emergence up and out of these dimensions
- Transformation from three to four dimensions to an n-dimensional universe

#### A LEGACY ON EARTH

**Ancient Egyptian Legacy on Earth**

**Background:**
- Ancestors believed to have established a system on Earth millennia ago through pyramids and temples
- Pyramids and obelisks: solar religion, vibrational network for human consciousness ascent
- Lost pathway and science hinted at in ruins

**Description of the System:**
- Gigantic instrument of communication and ascension
- Tones important for inducing energy flow in beings
- Egyptian obelisks set correct frequency for interstellar travel
- Part of a single great machine, integral instruments in vibrational network
- Language of the machine was the language of nature

**Evidence:**
- Schwaller de Lubicz: demonstrated mathematical and geometric sequences in temple complexes at Luxor
- Pyramids at Giza plateau aligned with Orion's belt stars
- Exacting alignments within pyramids for initiation rites

**The Universe as Elegant Design:**
- Space is curved, folding, and expansive
- Evolution: expansive force in human context
- Neuromelanin increase in brain and central nervous system linked to evolution and interaction with dark energy of the cosmos

**Questions for Further Reflection:**
- What does it mean that we are part of this vast design, this evolving universe?
- How can we decipher the dynamics of space, time, and gravitationally enfolded light as adults to enter the common language and travel as free spirits in the realm of light?
- What does it mean to leave the Earth of our birth and enter the wider life of the cosmos?
- Can manipulating shapes (in meditation or conscious dreaming) interact with this primordial reality?

### 7. PRACTICE, DISCIPLINE, AND GOALS

**The Spiritual Life: Practice, Discipline, and Goals**

**Importance of Practical Discipline**:
- Establishes disciplines of mind, body, and attention
- Root of the mind is attention, a practical principle
- Necessary for exploring or encountering phenomena from unconscious/superconscious
- Helps overcome ingrained fears and reactions, go against resistance

**Discipline in Ureaus Practice**:
- Important to harness emotional and psychological sense of purpose and direction
- Control mammalian heritage (not just sexuality)
- Bodily energies are natural resources to be harnessed and directed
- Negative attitudes towards sexuality and bodily functions are disturbing
- Group/ritualistic practices, like yoni and lingam worship, are part of the roots of sacred energetic practices

**Unseen Reality and Practice**:
- Certain times unseen reality can arise, causing unsettling feelings
- Practice is necessary to discipline and clear body and mind
- Ethics emerge as a necessity to avoid dangers and traps
- Traditional do's and don'ts of ethical practice make logical sense

#### THE QUIET INNER ATTUNEMENT

**Quiet Inner Attunement:**
- Necessary to quiet excessive mental noise for deeper voices to arise
- Occurs on psychic, psycho logical and neurophysiological levels
- Quieting response increases access to midbrain limbic system (amygdala)
- Allows awareness of unconscious forces and collective racial memory
- Awareness of imagery and information from Earth's energy lines (dragon and ley lines)
- Discovery of acupuncture meridians as areas of low electrical resistance
- Subjective nature of light observable through inner meditation
- Attunement between solar expansion grid, geomagnetic grid, and physical body
- Modern science collaborates with ancient discoveries through physiological instruments
- Awareness and entry into realm of transcendental energies
- Balance between daily needs and eternal processes achieved through quieting attunement disciplines.

**Quieting Response:**
- Reduces mental noise for deeper voices to be heard
- Occurs on psychic, psycho logical, and neurophysiological levels
- Increases access to midbrain limbic system (amygdala)
- Allows awareness of unconscious forces and collective racial memory
- Subjective nature of light observable through inner meditation
- Tracing of subtle energetic lines in the body
- Modern science collaborates with ancient discoveries through physiological instruments

**Acupuncture Meridians:**
- Discovered as areas of low electrical resistance in the body

- Not measured externally by physical instruments, but observable subjectively.

**Transcendental Energies:**
- Realm of energies that surround, infuse the Earth
- Achieved through inner quieting attunement disciplines
- Balance between daily needs and eternal processes.

#### DANGERS AND DELUSIONS OF THE PATH

**Dangers and Delusions of the Path**

**Recognizing Disturbing Dynamics**:
- Historically, "cults of the shadows" have been seductive to unprepared practitioners
- Charismatic leaders can awaken energies in followers, leading to delusion and organized violence
- Example: Hitler as a charismatic cult leader, inspiring mass suicide/murder

**Mesmerizing Cult Leaders**:
- Use religious hypnotic aura to stimulate energy in others
- Surrender personal responsibility, leading to collective action
- Deluded followers believe in a "higher power" or messianic figure

**Awakening Energies**:
- Dangers and delusions forestalled by mental clarity and physical health
- Learn healthy habits: diet, moderation, sexual energy, breath control
- Distinguish between perceptions and personal delusions
- Develop direct line between unconscious, conscious mind, and superconscious trajectory

### 8. A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SERPENT POWERS

**Serpent Powers: A Brief History**

**Connection to Animals and Mythology**:
- Serpent power was central to Earth's power centers throughout history
- Recognition of connection with animals and mythical figures
- Symbolized by the serpent Ureaus or kundalini, representing primordial sacred force

**India and Kundalini Worship**:
- Pre-Aryan India: Worshipped as the naga or nagi, genii of places, connected to magic, yoga, and occult sciences
- Statues of yogis with matted dreadlocks and erect phalluses found in pre-Aryan cities
- Connection between penile/clitoral erection, erotic sensation, and sense of flight during meditation

**Cultivation of Serpent Power**:
- Pashupati Order: Extreme social behaviors to transcend dualistic consciousness
- Kalamukhas, Kapalikas, and Aghoris: Adopted unconventional practices for spiritual growth
- Yogic path: Wore monk's robes, practiced breath control, studied hidden powers or siddhis

**Tibetan Connections**:
- Tantric texts replete with sexual imagery and unification of polarities
- Bardo Thodol (Tibetan Book of the Dead) and other tantric texts continue this knowledge

**Cultivation of Sexual Energy**:
- Avoidance of sexuality to conserve energies for higher sublimation: Urdhvareta
- Intense sexuality to feed kundalini with copious amounts of ojas (energies/essence)
- Collective group sexual union in chakra-puja and worship of female form in temples

**Biological Reality**:
- Kundalini and sexual fluids are dynamically related to each other
- Awakening of shakti first creates an acute need to refocus sexual energy.

#### "Ancient Spiritual Practices and Kundalini Energy: Egypt and India"

**Sexual Energies and Spiritual Evolution**

**Relationship between Brain and Sexual Regenerative Systems:**
- Sexual energies, as well as other bodily systems' generative forces, are enlisted in the kundalini's rising process.
- Intimate relationship between brain and sexual regenerative systems during spiritual evolution.

**Ancient Mystery Schools: Egypt and India**

**Kemetic Mystery Schools:**
- Three levels of initiation for initiates to seventh level of soul.
- Serpent powers referenced in various texts, including Papyrus of Ani.
- Wadjit and Nekhebit, double goddesses representing intertwined Ureaus currents.

**Kundalini Representation:**
- Kemetic Demotic script symbol for sound vibration "om" closely resembles Indian yogic symbol.
- Extensive cultural exchange between Dravidian India and Egypt.

**Uraeus Serpent and Sphinx:**
- Older than known history, built before 10,500 BCE.
- Built by followers of Horus or Ausar to gain entrance to timeless solar ambience through raising djedhi column (spinal line).

**Force Centers along the Nile:**
- Each location associated with specific star clusters and constellations.
- Djedhi masters raised living energy within the djedhi column.

**Earlier Civilization:**
- Serpents of wisdom descended on Earth, dispersing wisdom from an earlier civilization in Africa and southern India.
- Zep Tepi, the "splendid time of the first time," marked as origin of ancient Egyptian civilization.

#### THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DYNAMICS OF MEDITATIVE PRACTICE

**The Psychological Dynamics of Meditative Practice**

**Early Understanding of Mind:**
- No binding concept of mind in early traditions
- Direct experience of deep intuition and insight was first
- The experience of pure consciousness was revelation
- Consciousness was believed to be non-local, unbounded, and infinite

**Discovery of Attention:**
- Attention discovered as a means to harness and bind the mind
- Meditation can be understood as the light of attention turned back on itself
- Paths begin with concentration then deepen into mind dissolution

**Categories of Meditation:**
- Open, outward flowing meditation: observing the world
  - Individual self disappears while consciousness remains
- Concentration and absorption in an object
  - Both have same ultimate trajectory but different initial directions

**Meditation vs. Prayer:**
- Not prayer or a petition to a divinity
- Discipline of interior knowledge, merger, and perfect identification with the essence of the spiritual absolute

**Beginning Meditation:**
- Attempting meditation can be difficult due to distractions and inner stimuli
- Focusing on breath, posture, and bodily disciplines helps
- Fear and psychological defenses may manifest as fears, fantasies, or strange phenomena
- Stay with the process and it will accelerate over time

**Meditation in the Dark:**
- Meditating in darkness can help the process move more quickly
- Psychological defenses will eventually thin out
- Personal terrors and stimuli may emerge during deep meditation
- Stay focused and bear with the experience.

##### Exploring Consciousness and Energy through Meditation

**The Progression of Attention and Consciousness in Meditation:**

**Letting Go of Unwanted Thoughts:**
- Do not struggle with thoughts; let them pass and die away
- Steadiness counts, adding to the strength of practice
- Faith and occasional clarity/bliss aid the process
- Over hours and years, attention falls in love with its own steadiness
- Unwanted dialogue is bleached out, deep seeded thoughts cease to fascinate or shock

**Experience of Tranquility:**
- Pleasurable experience associated with tranquility
- Consciousness moves from intellectual process to intuitive experiences of unity
- Rhythmic breathing and extended breath retention steady the process
- Attention can hold fast in a storm of distractions, intuit its own arising
- Flashes of insight and beauty pull at the soul, reflecting the mysterious trajectory

**Energy Progression:**
- Behind babble of words, memories, and images, emerges a tangible sense of energy and light that flows through all objects
- It becomes a background radiation as consciousness merges with it
- No sharp distinction between stages of concentration on object, contemplation, and fusion/identification with the object

**Deeper Practice:**
- Deconstruction or progressive disengagement within internalized mental culture
- Language and thought processes integrate and then separate again in meditation
- Breath awareness is crucial for this stage, extending exhalation and breath retention help expand consciousness
- The breath interpenetrates previously separated states of awareness, leading to lucid dreaming and consciousness travel between waking, dreaming, and deep sleep states

**Body Meditation:**
- Quiet and witness the meaning and function of organ systems in meditation
- Unconscious reveals dynamics of conflicts, emotional loadings, and functions, some associated with familial and intimate learning and genetic connections
- Superconscious slowly descends into consciousness, revealing organs as expressions of higher functions within the realm of light and their symbolic meaning

**Energy and Matter:**
- If everything is an expression of energy, matter is the sleep of light
- Living body occurs in a wider theater of light, seen and unseen
- Dissolution of organs and energy field replacement hint at future bodies of symbolic functions and energy exchanges in higher evolution.

##### Exploring Meditation Techniques for Inner Growth

**The Power of Mantra and Meditation**

**The Clear Light**:
- Must go past the illusion of death, dissolition, and emptiness into the boundless energy and light
- The object of attention can be anything - sound, image, sensation/feeling
- Certain objects (e.g., mantra, image, sensation) are more potent than others in holding the mind's focus

**Mantra**:
- Has three functions:
  - Focuses consciousness to dissolve it into the mantra
  - Helps steady the mind for ideation and comprehension
  - Binds and controls lower forces
- Mantras can be embedded in familiar songs, melodies, or rhythms to deepen their impact
- Mantras are used both internally and externally (e.g., written on coffins) to guide the soul through the afterlife

**Open Attention Pathway**:
- Focuses on the seamless space and wordless awareness behind phenomena
- Practitioners aim to be constantly open and aware, leading to a "river of insight" and bliss
- Meditation on feelings, sensations, and emotions can help explore subtle regions of consciousness

**Breath Meditation**:
- Slowing the breath helps slow the mind, leading to dissolution of language, thought, and consciousness
- The breath is subordinate to the "laya" or dissolution of the "I" sense, which depends on the "nada" or sound in the body
- Higher levels of meditation bring luminosity, ecstasy, and insight

**Entrainment with Earth's Frequencies**:
- Slow, rhythmic breathing can entrain the heart and brain to the Earth's Schumann resonance
- This lucid state has evolutionary significance

**Dissolution of the "I"**:
- When the meditative process is successful, the knower becomes completely identified with the known, dissolving the "I"

#### THE COLLECTIVE VISION OF THE HUMAN HEART

**The Collective Vision of the Human Heart**

**Sense of Unity**:
- We have always sensed the deeper unity of everything around and within us
- Collectively, we have sensed the flows of energy from the Earth, within ourselves, and through everything that surrounds us
- We've sensed the existence of subtle beings in various forms of nature (e.g., sky beings, light beings, beings in trees, waters, waves)

**Five Elements**:
- In our collective history, we shared a common perception of five basic elements that made up the material world
- These were really five states of matter: earth, water, fire, air, and space itself
- All these elements were found within our own bodies and throughout the world around us

**Evolution of Perception**:
- As civilizations rose and fell, we became more sophisticated in our perceptions
- In the common era, we do not see five elements as much as various "states of matter"
- However, we've held to our intuition that embedded within these various forces of nature are different spirits and forms of animation in the world
- These are embedded aspects of luminous forces and beings that infuse but are not limited to our three dimensions of space and time

**Multidimensional Universe**:
- Our present age has realized, through both spiritual reflection and high empirical science, that we are deeply embedded in a multidimensional universe
- The goal, purpose, and trajectory of practice for every transcendental path is to transcend the dimensions we find ourselves in and return to our primordial source
- Every human embodiment is an evolution toward the avatar and the angel
- The universe is vast, interwoven, multidimensional, and home; every soul is a destiny and a teacher to races and species yet to be scattered throughout the stellar abyss.

## PART FOUR: The Luminous Work

"Man is a living laboratory where nature works out its purpose for him.  Or man himself may be the working lab, collaborating to create a Superman – God in his own essence. The true self transcends all material limitations and becomes absolute truth, free from fear and mortality." 


This version emphasizes:

* **Directness:** Removes extra words and phrases.
* **Key Concepts:** Highlights core ideas of Aurobindo's passage (living lab metaphor) and Bhagavad Gita's message about yoga.
* **Conciseness:** Makes the passage more impactful with fewer words.

### 9: ETHICS, ENERGY, AND THE BODILY DISCIPLINES

Ethics, energy, and bodily disciplines intersect in profound ways.

#### THE GOALS

**The Goals of Spiritual Development: A Focus on Four Interrelated Disciplines**

**Goal 1:** Breath Control as a Discipline
- Helps focus vital bodily forces (somatic and subtle)
- Absorption and direction of energy
- Incorporates sexuality and diet
- Necessary for healthy conduction and cooperation with rising energies

**Goal 2:** Postures
- Importance in focusing and guiding energy movement
- Functionality discussed

**Goal 3:** Flame of Attention
- Rooted in mind and psychophysical substrate
- Meditative discipline turns attention back on itself
- Merging with source

**Goal 4:** Coordinating Movements (breath, body, biochemistry)
- Conducting life current upward into the brain
- Methodology has various names: yoga, sema tawi, etc.
- Necessary for practice but not sufficient for awakening
- Inner organic movement must be discovered and led by intention, commitment, and repetition.

**Techniques Outlined:**
1. Breath control (focus/direction)
2. Postures (guidance of energy)
3. Mudras and manipulations (breath, body, biochemistry coordination)

**Preparation for Absorption and Flight**
- Techniques serve as foundation for practice
- Not sufficient for awakening the sleeping light within
- Inner movement must be discovered and led upward by focused intention.

**Traditions and Texts:**
- Many schools with various techniques and methods
- Some overlap in techniques (e.g., Egyptian Yoga Postures, The Serpent Power)
- Each emphasizes certain methods based on cultural context and teacher intuition
- Specific, exacting, and detailed techniques based on common anatomy, psychophysiology, and shared explored territory.

**Personal Intuition:**
- Master fundamental techniques elaborated here
- Be open to your own intuition
- Turn inward and follow the subtle call of your own lineage back to its source.

#### THE BODILY DISCIPLINES: HEALTH AND BREATH

**Bodily Disciplines for Health and Breath:**

**Importance of Basic Disciplines:**
- A healthy spine is crucial in kundalini yoga
- Essential for a supple, flexible, and strong back
- Improves spinal fluid circulation
- Quiets the brain and sets stage for meditation

**Spinal Flex Kriya:**
1. **Find comfortable sitting position:**
   - Cross-legged on floor or mat (Siddhasana)
   - Focus eyes at forehead, top of head, or tip of nose
2. **Flex spine forward and backward:**
   - Hold ankles with hands
   - Inhale: flex spine forward
   - Exhale: flex spine backward
   - Repeat for several minutes
3. **Side twists:**
   - Sit on heels, place hands on lower thighs
   - Inhale and twist to one side
   - Exhale and twist to opposite side
   - Repeat for several minutes
4. **Hand mudra:**
   - Cup hands together at heart level
   - Move elbows up and down during inhalation and exhalation
   - Switch sides of inhalation and exhalation
   - Repeat for several minutes
5. **Upper spine flexion:**

6. **Shoulder movement:**
   - Move shoulders up during inhalation and down during exhalation
7. **Head rotation:**
   - Slowly rotate head in a circle along neck line

**Benefits:**
- Increases spinal fluid circulation
- Quiets brain for meditation
- Releases energy (pranathana) without causing harm to nature or body.

#### WHY BREATH CONTROL?

**The Significance of Breath Control**
- **First and last act**: Taking a breath when entering the world, exhaling before departure
- Identification of breath with spirit across various languages and cultures
  - "Primal anxiety" linked to birth trauma and taking first breath
  - Holding breath or having it taken away referencing the power of breath
- Ancient beliefs associating ba (vital breath) with life force
  - Ba leaves when vital breath exits, causing death
  - Prana in India, linked to vital principle; controlling breath aids consciousness
  - Breath not identical to prana but intimately associated
  - Swara yogis control vital energies through the breath
- Importance of mastering control of these energies: Pranayama (harnessing and controlling breath's energies)
- Flow of energy/living force through major and minor passages in the body.

#### THE SCIENCE OF BREATH

**The Science of Breath**

**Modern Scientific Perspective**:
- Focuses on how oxygen enters the body, is absorbed, and carbon dioxide is exhaled
- Recent clinical research on neurophysiological dynamics of brain, biochemistry, and breathing in psychopathological states like hyperventilation

**Traditional Yogic Perspective**:
- Ancient yogis controlled breath to gain intimate control over psychophysiology and neurophysiological phenomena
- Breath retention stimulates metabolic processes, basis of pranayama

**Pranayama Techniques**:
- Traditional sources contain exaggerated claims about techniques' benefits
- Deeper practice involves using breath to harness thought and life energy flow
- Breath, thought, and emotionality are interwoven

**Human Nervous System**:
- Central (brain, spinal cord) and Peripheral (somatic, autonomic) nervous systems
- Autonomic system: sympathetic (stimulates heart rate, blood vessel constriction) and parasympathetic (slows heart rate, dilates vessels) divisions
- Sympathetic and parasympathetic innervate all organ systems

**Breathing and the Nervous System**:
- Inhalation: Heart rate increases slightly, blood vessels constrict slightly
- Exhalation: Heart rate slows slightly, blood vessels dilate slightly
- Continual subtle vibration and pulsation around the body associated with breath

**Cranial Nerves**:
- 1st (olfactory) nerve innervates midbrain limbic system for primitive emotionality
- 10th (vagus) nerve stimulates diaphragmatic breathing, calming effects on heart rate, anxiety decrease, increased saliva production, Gl tract stimulation

**Breathing Techniques**:
- Diaphragmatic breathing: Slows heart rate, decreases anxiety, increases sense of calm
- Alternate nostril breathing: Fundamental practice to gain mastery over yogic breathing.

#### APPLICATION OF SUSHUMNA

**Sushumna and Breathing Techniques:**

**Application of Sushumna:**
- Focus eyes at top lip and bottom nose or tip
- Create trancelike condition
- Activate central channel in spinal cord (Sushumna nadi)
- Negate left and right channels
- Access internal central channel
- Energy begins to rise through one of the subtle canals
- Practice earlier exercises for awareness

**Kumbhaka:**
- Retain breath within or outside body
- Stimulates parasympathetic nervous system
- Slows heart rate, increases saliva production, etc.
- Extend capacity slowly to avoid negative effects

**Rechka:**
- Controlled exhalation of breath
- Stimulates parasympathetic nervous system
- Increases body heat, gastrointestinal stimulation, etc.

**Puraka:**
- Controlled inhalation of breath
- Heart rate increases, sympathetic activity increases
- Brain engagement in rhythmic activity
- Meditative disciplines that slow heart and brain waves

**Ujjayi Breathing:**
- Deep breath with retention
- Creates noise
- Removes phlegm, enhances digestive power
- Practice walking or sitting

**Bastrika Breathing:**
- Rapid breathing to clear lungs of devitalized air
- Increases prana (life energy)
- Gently close anal sphincter with mulabandha
- Diaphragm moves back and forth equally with inhalation and exhalation
- Build up speed over time, no heroics or rushing
- Stimulates Urethra and helps pierce the three knots: Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra granthis.

**Kabalabati:**
- Same as bastrika breathing but with quick forceful exhalations instead of breath retention.

#### THE BASIC POSTURES: ASANAS

**Basic Postures: Asanas**

**The Importance of Basic Postures**:
- Guide subtle energies through the body
- Provide stability for meditative practice
- Increase sense of stability, physical comfort, and ease
- Facilitate blood circulation and endocrine system activity
- Allow for energy storage and accumulation
- Free attention from bodily tension and focus on consciousness dynamics

**The Origins of Asanas**:
- Many modern asanas have little connection to ancient yoga practices
- Originated from British colonial policies, European gymnastic/health movements, photography trends, and Indian yogic teachers

**Selecting the Right Asana**:
- Find a sitting posture that stabilizes the lower body, puts gentle pressure on the anal lock, and allows for easy lung expansion
- Experiment with different poses to find what works best
- Consider injuries or health concerns
- The goal is to gently focus attention and awareness, and facilitate energy/consciousness flow

**Easy Pose (Sukhasana)**:
- One of the simplest and most comfortable postures
- Involves sitting comfortably on a supportive chair with knees bent and feet on the floor

**More Advanced Asanas**:
- Siddhasana and Swastikasana require more effort but are highly beneficial
- Siddhasana is useful for meditative practices involving bioenergetic circulation

**Mudras**:
- Hand gestures used to facilitate energy flow and concentration

**The Role of a Personal Teacher**:
- A personal teacher can guide the student in the beginning
- In rare cases, a subtle/inner plane teacher can provide guidance

**Conclusion**:
- Postures help energy flow through and circulate within the system
- Many poses are inspired by animal movements and natural forms

#### THE THREE LOCKS, OR BANDHAS

**Three Locks or Bandhas**

**Importance:**
- Mastering three locks ensures skillful flow of primal shakti through body
- Located at base of spine (mulabandha), lower middle stomach area, and neck under chin
- Employ breath and physical locks in coordination

**First Lock: Muladhara or Root Lock**
- Associated with anus and toilet training
- Essentially early childhood sphincter control training
- Mastery required for autonomy and separation
- Fear, violence, terror linked to loss of control
- Higher technical mastery: Ashvini mudra, Vajroli mudra
- Activates parasympathetic nerves, lowers blood pressure, respiration, heart rate
- Stimulates pudenda nerve branches to sexual organs for sensory and motor functions
- Balances autonomic nervous system
- Prevents uncomfortable downward energy flow

**Second Lock: Uddiyana (Solar Plexus)**
- Located at pit of stomach and solar plexus area
- Pull abdominal muscles back towards spine with breath exhaled out
- Gentle lifting sensation of internal organs up into back of spine
- Stimulates "brain-in-the-stomach" and discharges energy
- Tones and balances autonomic nervous system
- Massages kidneys and stimulates adrenal glands.

**Common Practices:**
- Apply gentle pressure at base area, usually the heel of foot
- Contract and lift perineum region
- Inhale, retain breath, apply root lock; or exhale then close root lock
- Repeat internal hydraulics sequences for conductivity of life current.

#### THE ROLE OF MUDRAS

**Mudras and Spiritual Development**
* Mudras: physical postures and gestures that guide subtle energies through the body
* Used for spiritual development in various traditions, including yoga and tantra
* Not explicitly mentioned in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras or other classical texts

**Classical Mudras**
* Principal mudras: Mahamudra, Mahabandha mudra, Mahavedha mudra, mulabandha, uddiyana bandha, jalandhara bandha, Viparitaka Karani, Vajroli, Shakti Chalana
* Support spiritual development by guiding energy through the body's subtle channels
* Some mudras focus on hands or eyes, others involve bodily postures

**Viparitaka Karani (Head Stand) and Vajroli**
* Help reverse and reabsorb life-energy back into the body for spiritual growth
* Viparitaka Karani: physical reversal of energy flow through Head Stand pose
* Vajroli: manipulation of sexo-yogic sphincter after orgasm

**Less Controversial Mudras**
* Taoist and tantric traditions offer less difficult techniques for spiritual development
* Avoid practices like Amaroli and Sahajoli, which can be difficult or disturbing

**Hand Mudras in Tantric Buddhism**
* Vishnu mudra: unknown purpose
* Jnana mudra: facilitates focus and concentration during meditation (see Figure 9.9)

**Inner Mudras**
* Yoni mudra: closes nine gates or openings of the body, guiding attention inward for psychological absorption on sound or images
* Khechari mudra: facilitates energy flow and focus, inducing a tranquil, transcendent state (see Figure 9.11)

**Caution**
* Some advanced mudras can be difficult or dangerous without proper guidance
* Be cautious when practicing advanced techniques like cutting the frenum lignum to elongate the tongue
* Seek direct guidance from a personal teacher for best results.

##### Inner Mudras for Energy Flow & Spiritual Growth

**Mudras and Their Impact on Consciousness and Energy Flow**

**Slowing Respiration**:
- Slowing respiration is an effective way to induce higher states of consciousness
- This can lead to focus shifting to the top of the head or beyond

**Breathing Techniques**:
- **Diaphragmatic Breathing**: Focus on breathing from the diaphragm, not just the chest
- **Alternate Nostril Breathing**: Inhale through one nostril, exhale through the other to balance energy flow
- **Sushumna Application**: Concentrate on the midline of the body and spine to stimulate pineal activity

**Inner Mudras**:
- **Shambhavi Mudra**: Focus internal attention on chakras or spine while externally gazing at an object, leading to trance state and perception of underlying current/light
- **Khechari Mudra**: Fix gaze at midbrow point or top of head, stimulating optic nerve and pineal activity
- **Mahamudra (Great Seal)**: Combines practices like Siddhasana pose, pressing anus on left heel, stretching right leg, and focusing gaze to stimulate the Urethra and rise of kundalini energy
- **Shakti Chalana Mudra**: Awakens and guides kundalini up the spine using breath retention and bandha techniques

**Mahavedha (not well explored here)**: Requires significant upper body strength, involves striking the buttocks against the ground to stimulate energy flow through Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna.

### 10. THE DYNAMICS OF BREATH CONTROL AND THE DISCIPLINE OF BODILY ABSORPTION

**Breath Control and Body Absorption**
- Connection between breath control, mind, vitality, and energy conductivity through body
- Importance of ethical practices for evolutionary adaptiveness
- Variety of postures in different approaches to practice
- Necessity of a personal teacher

**Energy Pathways and Primal Shakti/Kundalini Rising**
- Energy stirrings along the spine
- Absorption of luminous energies by consciousness
- Melanin and neuromelanin's role in process

**Chapter 10 Focus: Energy Conductivity and the Central Canal (Sushumna Nadi)**
- Exploring control and trajectory of energy currents through specific lines or conduits in the body
- Parallels between human body's energy lines and Earth's energy conduits
- Three primary locks/bandhas for controlling vital energy through central canal: necessary for focused conductivity
- Health risks without them

**Central Canal Development**
- Beginning in mother's womb
- Central aspect of physical development
- Becomes crucial for spiritual development

**Dynamics of Life Current and Attention**
- Rise of this force into the brain towards uppermost regions
- Final circuit: involution of consciousness into matter to eventual evolution back to source (light)

#### THE SIGNS AND SYMBOLS OF ENERGY FLOW THROUGH THE BODY

**Signs and Symbols of Energy Flow Through the Body**

**Primal Life Energy (Shakti) Expression:**
- Can manifest as inner sounds moving through body
- Sensations, currents felt in dense physical body
- Training necessary to distinguish from medical/psychiatric symptoms
- Misdiagnosis possible by unaware professionals

**Awakening and Rise of Ureaus (Maha Shakti):**
- Associated with specific hormonal and endocrine functions
- Manifestations: kriyas, spontaneous movements, subtle sounds
- Symbolized culturally through various representations: medical caduceus, ancient Egyptian ankh, shamanic headdresses
- Connected to melanin in inner organs and neuromelanin in brain

**Gopi Krishna's Experience:**
- Describes subtle, organic, nervelike substance
- Merging of cerebrospinal fluid with sexual organs
- White-silver serpentine motion upward to brain
- Intensity of concentration stimulates activity above palate and below crown.

**Subtle Element that Imparts Vitality:**
- Constant process in nervous system
- Imports organic element from all organs and tissues
- Extremely subtle, carried by nerves in minute measure.

#### THE ROLE OF DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATHING AND THE FIRST AND TENTH CRANIAL NERVES

**Diaphragmatic Breathing and Cranial Nerves**

**Role of Diaphragmatic Breathing**:
- Intimately associated with the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system
- Helps turn attention back inward through relaxation, tension reduction, and eventually attention itself
- Parasympathetic response decreases bodily/mental tensions, freeing attention to turn inward

**Technique for Creating Parasympathetic Response**:
1. Diaphragmatic breathing for 3-4 minutes
2. Alternate nostril breathing for 3-4 minutes
3. Focus attention at the top of the lip and bottom of the nose, or tip of the nose
4. This activates the central canal and deactivates "secondary currents" on right/left sides
5. Quiets "serpents" (energies) that move into central canal, awakening the "ba, or spiritual bird"

**Importance of Focus Points**:
- Top of lip, bottom of nose, or tip of nose are major energy termination points (acupuncture, yogic theory)
- Awaken and flow energy from organ systems into central canal for medical practice and meditation.

#### THE TONGUE ON THE UPPER PALATE

**Procedure: Khechari Mudra and Shambhavi Mudra**

**Khechari Mudra:**
- Pressure applied to upper palate with tongue, creating gentle pressure
- Eyes focused at top of head or midpoint between eyes
- Unites major yin and yang channels, creating microcosmic orbit
- Stimulates pituitary and pineal glands
- Revealing when concentrated on by an accomplished teacher

**Shambhavi Mudra:**
- Initiates energies along spine
- Focused attention on base of spine
- Energy nodules along major currents of subtle energy body stimulated
- Talu, an area associated with uvula, indirectly stimulated in this procedure

**Additional Practice:**
- Focus on physical space slightly above head
- Reverberation of phenomena associated with awakened pineal gland drawn upward in conical fashion
- Sensations include "drilling," pulsing sensations, and sense of "piercing" at times.

#### RETURN TO THE PSYCHODYNAMICS OF ATTENTION

**Fundamental Paths of Attention**
- **One-pointed approach**: Meditative absorption, focusing attention on a single focal point
    - Bringing attention inward to dissolve observer into all phenomena (samyama)
    - Identification with primordial light that gives rise to all phenomena
- **Outward flow**: Opening attention to whatever arises in awareness without differentiation
    - Dissolution of the observer, merger with all phenomena

**Light and Darkness in Meditation**
- Focus on light: Identification with primordial light that gives rise to all phenomena
    - Subsumes categorizations of space, time, form, and ideation
- Focus on darkness: Meditating in the absence of visual light
    - Increases sensitivity to other senses and helps dissolve internal/external boundary
    - Experiencing blissful dissolution with a vast expansion of personal boundary
    - Biochemical and neuromodulating activity supports this process

**Challenges in Meditation**
- Wavering mind: Fantasies, worries, distracting images, bodily sensations
- Irrational fears and perceived threats to psychological survival
- Fear of bodily dissolution as parts of the body dissolve in attention
    - Associated with death, annihilation, and descent into nonexistence

**Deepening Meditation Practices**
- Focusing on a particular part of the body or image (Sri Yantra)
- Using mantras like "om" to enhance concentration and attention
- Incorporating sensation of pleasure to deepen bodily absorption
- Remembering the "bliss sheath" sensation from deep sleep or orgasm
    - Awakening and blending these experiences to deepen meditation

**Advanced Meditation Practices**
- Lucid dreaming or yoga nidra: Entering dreaming state from waking state without loss of consciousness
- Passing from dreaming into dreamless sleep, retaining a thin whisper of consciousness
    - Great light awakens beyond

**Mental Exercise and Neurogenesis**
- Focused attention is a form of mental exercise, strengthening the mind
- New neurons are continually added to adult human cerebral cortex (neurogenesis)
    - Implications are vast if consciousness and intentionality stimulate this process.

### 11. THE FAMILY OF KUNDALINI RISINGS

**Kundalini Rising Pathways**

**Introduction**:
- Kundalini energy takes various pathways during awakening process
- Ancient texts from Egypt and India describe different routes
- Importance of proper preparation and understanding potential risks

**Pathways Description**:
1. **Classical Traditions**: Six primary routes or principal nadis in spinal line
2. **Shape and Form**: Kundalini informs the energy; shape is a conduit or pathway
3. **Primary Maha Shakti**: Initially stirred, followed by arousal, release, and full rising
4. **Movements/Kriyas**: Gentle rocking back and forth, side to side, circular rotating movement
5. **Partial, Intermediate, or Full Rising**
   - Deflected risings: Ureaus stuck in cul-de-sac, creating unpleasant effects
   - Quick ascension with challenging results
6. **Clinical Detail**: Risings vary from individual to individual; dangerous during initial stirring and arousal stages
7. **Religious Experiences**: Potential for religious fundamentalism and manipulation by charismatic leaders

**Preparation and Understanding**:
- Proper posture, breathing techniques, spinal flex kriya, and mastery of bandhas
- Personal and family unconscious images influence the process
- Importance of a steady practice to open central channel.

#### The Journey of Kundalini Awakening: Stages and Challenges

**Kundalini Rising: Stages and Complications**

**Necessity of Formal Practice**
- Importance of learning basic locks (mulabandha, uddhiyana, jalandhara)
- Discipline the rising or protect system from unfortunate events

**Kundalini Uncoiling: First Level**
- Full release of kundalini shakti
- Stimulates muladhara chakra and activates associated energies
- Can be triggered by deep meditation, powerful emotional focus, intense mental development, devotion or shaktipat
- Energy enters one of six primary nadis (Sushumna, Saraswati, Vajra, Lakshmi, Chitrini, Brahma-Rendra)

**Partial Rising: Second Level**
- Kundalini breaks through linga at heart center
- Attempts to move up through Sushumna nadi
- Can reach heart or subtle brain centers but gets stuck at bandha linga
- Characteristic serpentine motion during this time
- Complications include deflected risings (Saraswati, Vajra nadis)

**Faux Full Rising: Intermediate Level**
- Energy rises up through Sushumna nadi to ajna chakra point
- Stabilizes at this plateau and requires special techniques for further ascent
- Intense activity with various experiences, such as visions and sounds
- Personal teacher necessary during this time

**Complicated Risings: Upper Process Point**
- Energy rises through Sushumna nadi but stays below makra point
- Dangerous if it enters upper Sankhini nadi
- Can lead to dynamic worldly powers but not a full realization

**Complete Rising: Ultimate Goal**
- Kundalini breaks through various barriers at heart level, throat level, and brow point
- Reaches bindu point for ultimate culmination
- Repairs and detoxifies body while rejuvenating it
- Spontaneous mudras and postures may be stimulated during ascent.

- A person can be peaceful and enduring like a lotus in one place, and all royal splendor or emptiness in another.
- Time finds fulfillment in the wisdom contained within the heart of an individual.
- The subject of this teaching is the realization of the highest humanity.

**Sri Sankaracharya's Teaching**:
- He develops the analytic investigation of vitalization through stages, passing on to the disciple the wisdom that naturally calms and restrains their thoughts in the realms of some superior being.
- It is allowed for a person to release their burdens and place their stakes on the future.

**The Teaching of Thee Hard Decision**:
- In the Phoenomenon of Man, it is taught that this is a tolerated process for fulfilling and placing one's stakes in the future.

#### THE WAY OF WORSHIP AND DISSOLUTION

**Spiritual Leaders and Shaktipat**
* Historical figures initiating spiritual evolution: charismatic leaders during crises
* Advancement of individual's spiritual evolution through realized masters
* Transfer of spiritual energy (shaktipat) through touch, look, sound, or specific areas of the body
* Examples: Christ, Swami Muktananda
* Recognized as psychospiritual magnetism, not self-delusion or hypnosis

**Shaktipat Masters and Their Role**
* Awakening energy in practitioner at base of spine
* Posthumous experiences near master's tomb
* Safe method for modern mind according to Sri Aurobindo
* Alternative: less destabilizing, avoid turbulent energies

- Conscious universe, psychospiritual matter
- Methodology for awakening: major and minor orbits

**Micro orbit:**
- Energy circulation along spinal line
  - Inhalation: front body to feet
  - Exhalation: back body to crown
- Intimately associated with human consciousness
- Darkly pigmented neural tissue, bioelectrical capacities

**Macro orbit:**
- Energy extends beyond local body
- Visualized from specific star or constellation above
- Bring down front body during inhalation
- Up back body into head on exhalation

**Quantum Resonance:**
- Opening the "crystal palace"
- Focus on internal region while visualizing star constellations
- Quantum resonance or embrace of nonlocal energy field?
- Connection through common interconnected energy and space.

#### ACUPUNCTURE, Kl, AND CHI

**Acupuncture, Ki/Chi, and Meridians**

**Acupuncture System in China:**
- Parallel to macro and micro orbits
- Energy flow through select channels called meridians or mo
- Fifty-nine meridians, 760 points
- Twelve main meridians, eight extraordinary meridians

**Extraordinary Meridians:**
1. Ren mo (Conception Vessel): Yin meridian with twenty-four acupuncture points
   - Begins at anus and travels up to lower lip area
   - Generates chi, or energy
2. Du Mo (Governor Vessel): Yang meridian with twenty-eight acupuncture points
   - Starts at coccyx and follows spinal line to the eyebrows
   - Importance in balancing yin and yang energies

**Meridians' Connection:**
- Two lines run into and from an unbroken ellipse in chi or ki energy
- Flow is from coccyx through spinal line ellipse, ending at conception vessel (CVi)
- CVi is meeting point of both vessels and general lo point

**Importance of Mulabandha:**
- Stimulates base or anus and certain organs (small intestines, heart, lungs, colon, bladder, kidney circulation)
- Part of "three heaters" in acupuncture theory:
  1. Shangchiao (upper heater) - respiratory function governor
  2. Chungchiao (middle heater) - digestive function governor
  3. Hsiachiao (lower heater) - sexual and elimination functions
- Corresponds to heart, manipura, and muladhara chakras

**Du Meridian and Ren Meridian:**
- Meet at top of head inside skull when tongue is pressed to upper palate in Khechari mudra (Nasikagradrishti)
- Ajna chakra above eyebrow center is connected to origin of this vessel, GV sub l at tip of coccyx.

**Mulabandha's Role:**
- Powerful contribution to tunnel-like experience in spirit travel and NDEs.

#### THE DISCIPLINES OF ACTIVATION

**The Disciplines of Activation**

**Mythic and Mystical Traditions**:
- Rich in physically engaging methods for awakening energy
- Primal Shakti initiations of the Kemetic Egyptians influenced Greek mythology, including Pythagoras
- Egyptian initiations were both quiet (Great Pyramid) and active (Elysium fields)
- Techniques were methods of activation, including:
    - **Awakening the Ureaus** after a spiritual death and rebirth experience
    - Witnessing the success of the initiate's light body

**Methods of Activation**:
- Focus on the crown or top of the head, coordinated with pranayama and eye gaze
- Use of **mudras** as described before
- Utilization of **sexual energy** for conductivity through the spinal axis
    - Bacchanals and orgiastic rites in Elysium fields and India
- Use of **prana or pranic energy** to move down the spinal line and stimulate the sleeping serpent
    - Shakti Chalana: Stimulating the sleeping serpent at the base of the spine and leading it back upward through Sushumna nadi and into the crown
- Intense focus on the top of the mouth, bottom of the nose, or tip of the nose, with eyes closed and focused inwardly on the heart or spinal line
    - Can appear quieting but can also be activating responses

#### THE PATHWAYS OF HYPERAROUSAL

**Hyperarousal Techniques:** The Kung peoples of South Africa employ hyperactivation procedures for spiritual awakening using rhythmic dance, incantation, and movement of feet and lower back to stimulate Ureaus or kundalini energy.
* Rhythmic dance and incantation: Overwhelms midbrain limbic system, particularly amygdala, dissolving capacity for repression and filtering out disorganizing aspects of the world.
* Intense communal dancing and chanting: Frontal-limbic system used to enter a transcendental realm where temporal and spatial categorization is overwhelmed.
* Vodoun cults' serpent power experience: Initiate sits on live serpent during ritual dance, breath movement, incantation, and lower back flexion for altered state of consciousness and spiritual guidance by Orishas.

**Hyperarousal Technique Examples:**
- Kung peoples: Hyperactivation procedure using rhythmic dance, incantation, feet and lower back movement to stimulate Ureaus or kundalini energy.
- Vodoun cults: Live serpent sitting during intense ritual dancing, breathing, incantation, and lower back flexion for altered state of consciousness and spiritual guidance by Orishas.

**Historical Context:** Haitian Revolution began in a Vodoun rite leading to the relinquishing of French control over Haiti and sale of Louisiana territory to the United States.
- Connection between Vodoun traditions and Pentacostalism: Intimate connection with original West African rites; North American Pentacostals use hyperarousal techniques without calling it kundalini, instead using terms like Holy Ghost or Spirit Possession.

#### THE METHODS OF HYPERQUIETING

**Hyperquieting Methods**

**Ascetic Traditions**:
- Teach denial or severe restriction of bodily appetites and desires
- Can lead to inner, biochemical stimulation when done correctly
- Potential for extreme practices leading to self-denial and sensory withdrawal

**Monastic and Hermitage Lineages**:
- Rich with disciplines of sensory withdrawal (pratyahara)
- Posterior parietal lobes are denervated, leading to dissolving of space and self
- Transcendent experience arises when these areas are affected

**Hyperquieting Techniques**:
- Use of mantra and focused attention to inhibit categorization of space and time
- Meditative focus on sound or rhythm can amplify the experience of sound itself
- Light meditation can lead to dissolving of self-sense, external body, and localization in space
- Rhythmic breathing slowed to achieve sympathetic harmony with Earth's heartbeat (Schuman resonance)
- Expansive "opening experience" when sustained concentration is achieved.

#### THE SCIENCE OF KRIYA YOGA

**Kriya Yoga: Science of Indian Meditation**
* Integrates breath control and energy circulation around spine
* Lineage traces back to ancient Indian masters: Paramahansa Yogananda, Swami Sri Yukteswar, Lahiri Mahasaya, Babaji
* Originated from the science lost in history, rediscovered by Babaji
* Method involves pranayama (suspended and energized breath), focus on spine, detachment from body
* Energy spiraled around six energy centers or chakras along spine
* Torque: coiling dynamic linked to Earth's rotational dynamics
* Practice deepened by sensing Earth's energy and visualizing its movement up the spinal line
* Discipline executed multiple times a day, believed to quicken spiritual evolution
* Single coil around spine equals one year of regular life
* Soul's evolution may take a million years to reach cosmic consciousness
* Ancient seers knew about science and consciousness, possibly from a vaster solar civilization
* Twelve inner plexuses along the spine represent duality with twelve constellations orbiting solar sun and crown chakra.
* Center of our world is the center of our galaxy, not local sun.

#### THE METHOD OF MEDITATION AND ABSORPTION

**The Method of Meditation and Absorption**

**Sri Yantra Meditation**:
- The Sri Yantra is a complex figure emanating from a single point
- It represents the nine gates of the body and the enfolding space of manifestation
- Progressive meditation starts at the center or outer edges, moving inward and outward
- Focus on involution (inward) and evolution (outward) until complete absorption
- Combine with breath control and sensory withdrawal to achieve a radical meditative experience
- Transcends experience itself
- Pratyahara and self-absorption occur naturally during the process

**Five Elemental Solids Meditation**:
- The "force" ascends through each energy vortex on the spinal line, associated with one of five elemental solids
- Each solid shape is associated with a primal vibration or sound
- Achieve a steady posture and practice diaphragmatic breathing, alternate nostril breathing, and focus at the top lip/bottom nose
- Meditate on the sounds "lam", "vam", "ram", "yam", "ham" (or "hum") in sequence
- Associate each sound with a specific elemental solid shape (cube, icosahedron, tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron)
- Focus on the vibration of "aum" or "om" associated with either the dodecahedron or geodesic shape
- Gain intuition of all shapes underlying the three-dimensional solid world

#### BEYOND WHEN KUNDALINI IS AWAKENED

**Awakening Kundalini: Guiding the Energy's Flow**
* Call upon embodied teacher or subtle plane teachers for guidance and upward summons of kundalini energy
* Techniques used to remove blockages in pathway: postures, mudras, breathing techniques, seed sounds, diet shifts, internal meditation focus areas
* Invoke deities or supraluminous intelligences from ancestral Orishas to presiding deities within chakras
* Difficult knots to pierce: root (Ureaus entry), heart region, and junction above eyebrow point
* Critical that Ureaus rises through one of the channels into the brain for completion of circuit
* Brain, brain core, and cerebral cortex stimulated during process
* Three main bandhas to master: Mahabandha with exhalation and breath retention outside body
* Khechari mudra during meditation or before sleep entry
* Meditation practices during dreaming state help integrate fragments of self severed at birth
* Clear Light experience: profound, all-pervasive, intelligent light that arises from focusing attention at crown during meditation
* Brain's emerging dark neuromelanin structures attracted to and by light
* Various meditative techniques help move attention into this dawning or descending vast light
* Mind in this condition is clear of all arising objects; direct perception of radically intense, all-pervasive, intelligent light
* Intimate interface between neuromelanin, neural processes, and liberating emergent structures provides theater for phenomena
* Clear Light experience parallels intense sexual orgasm but without acoustic discharge
* Focus is in heart region or both simultaneously; intense emotional arousal of benevolent, devotional nature
* Preparation for piercing higher, deeper, more subtle brain centers through contact with one's own spiritual lineage during dreaming state.

##### Ascending Consciousness Through the Spinal Line and Ureaus.

**The Ascent of Consciousness: A Blissful and Painful Journey**

- Use of Yoni mudra for absorption in interior sounds
- Breath control leading to quiet dissolution and sense of dissolving into the inner sound or nada
- Bliss sensation merging with an ocean of light - the yoga of celestial sound current

**Understanding the Lower Planes**
- Importance of self-reflection and understanding own tendencies
- Danger of ignoring or repressing emotions, which become interwoven with spiritual vision
- Risk of projecting unwanted desires onto others and justifying pain, mass violence, and death

**The Ureaus Unfolding**
- Stimulating midbrain limbic system with powerful primitive mammalian and early Homo sapiens experiences
- Emotional waves flooding the system, revealing needs, fantasies, and complexes
- Importance of recognizing own core issues and avoiding errors in spiritual ascent

**Repeated Undulation and Restoration Phase**
- Piercing through blockages for upward movement
- Blending with vital bodily movements and energies during meditation
- Vital sexual and bodily energies enlisted in restoration stage
- Focus of eyes and attention on top of head or several inches above it
- Crucial to have a teacher during this phase
- Dawning of the great mystery beyond science, where each soul comes home to its own lineage and moves from life within matter to life within light.

##### Ascension of Consciousness Through Planes of Mind

**Shifts in Perceived Body Shape and Vibration during Meditation:**
* Body's shape and vibration changes as meditation progresses
* Experience of sound or vibration in various traditions

- Human beings are luminous beings exiled to this dimension

#### NOUMENOLOGY OF THE SUPERCONSCIOUS

**The Superconscious: Beyond the Dynamic Unconscious**

**Differences Between Dynamic Unconscious and Superconscious**
- Appearance vs. Reality: Similar from the outside, starkly different from the inside
- Limited unconscious: dynamic, subrational or pre-rational knowledge
- Superconscious: supra-mental, luminous direct intuition of reality

**Superconscious in Various Traditions**
- India: Atman and Purusa
- Greece: Nous
- Early Christian church fathers: Pneuma
- Egypt: Primeval Waters of Nun, Amenta, Abode of the Eternal Soul
- Vedas: Consciousness beyond analytic intellect
- West Africa: Luminous suprarational consciousness

**The Body in Different Perspectives**
- Unconscious: Dynamicism of conflicts, emotional loadings, organic functions
- Superconscious: Expressions of functions within the realm of light and energy

**The Nature of the Superconscious**
- No "I" or personal experiences
- Insight and knowledge surround and submerge the experiencing principle
- Transforming process leading to sustained inspiration in various forms (physics, poetry, music, mathematics)
- Fusion with source, revelation, and understanding rationality as the last to be born

**Development of Consciousness**
- Normative mind and consciousness
- Higher mind and illuminated consciousness
- Overmind consciousness
- Supramental consciousness

**The Egyptian Worldview**
- Birth and death as initiatory transitions in the process of eternal life and revelation.

#### TRANSDIMENSIONAL SOUL TRAVEL

**Transdimensional Soul Travel**

- Conduced in dark caves and underground grottos, with star charts on walls/ceilings
- Belief in "astral immortality" and soul's travels through celestial spheres after death
- Similar to Kemetic Egyptian practices in Great Pyramid and African sands

**Science of Consciousness**:
- Ancients knew 26,000-year cycle of precession of equinoxes
- Believed dark sun at center of galaxy sent pulsations affecting human consciousness
- Celestial technology of the soul, still present in fragments (e.g., Dogon people)

**Spiritual Evolution and Cycles**:
- Normal human requires 1 million years to perfect brain and soul
- Every 26,000 years there is a full precession cycle, part of 104,000-year great cycle
- Spiraling through Milky Way galaxy quickens spirit's evolution

**Shapes and Spirit Travel**:
- Knowledge of shapes is basis for exploring consciousness in sleep
- Practice changing shapes in meditation helpful
- Triune brain's folding and neuromelanin layers relate to subtle body coiling

**Navigating the Subtle Body**:
- Locate resonance between Earth's core rotation and internal energy body
- Awaken life current and move it up spinal line or brain stem nigrosular line
- Subtle electromagnetic and geogravitationally generated Earth grid unfolds ley lines

**Mind and Traveling Dimensions**:
- Mind has no form, but takes the form of everything around and within it
- When mind engages dimensions beyond physical, it learns to travel them

**Meditative Procedure: Spirit Travel**:
- Two methods presented in the text.

##### Exploring Astral Travel Techniques and Star Consciousness in Dogon Tradition

**Procedures for Spirit Travel:**
* Diaphragmatic breathing, alternate nostril breathing, application of Sushumna
* Spinal flex series at brow point, crown or nose
* Use three internal locks and pranayama with Shakti Chalana or another proven mudra
* Focus at the crown and go through each chakra from base to crown with "om" and breath
* Visualize a triangle with each successive chakra being subsumed into the one above it
* Above the crown, visualize either all triangles emerged into Sri Yantra or a large triangle
* Place yourself inside the triangle and focus on the gridlike pattern or long curving tunnel of consciousness principal

**Methods for Spirit Travel:**
1. Focus on activating the three common dimensions: length, depth, and width
2. Remember that identity is not limited to these dimensions
3. Conceive of gravity as a sixth dimension where space-time is warped
4. Harness attention through trance, ritual or meditation
5. Awaken the spiraling pattern of the twelve neuromelanin foci in the brain stem
6. Identify and resonate with stars, especially Sirius and Digitaria (po tolo)
7. Travel by manipulating and enfolding within the five fundamental shapes: sphere, cube, pyramid, tetrahedron, and torus
8. Recognize the symbolic nature of the physical body as a "prison" and draw in star energies
9. Switch between stars like swinging on ropes to move through different locations
10. Use Khechari mudra during meditation and conscious dream sleep.

##### "Ancient Cosmic Connection: Neurocosmology in Egyptian Mythology and Pyramids"

**The Dogon's Knowledge of the Cosmos**
* The Dogon have been incorporating knowledge of celestial phenomena into their myths and rituals since the 13th century
* They believe in a conical shape for ceremonial and habitat structures to capture the coiling phenomenon that stretches from Earth's center to the cosmos
* Kemetic Egyptians referred to this as "po tolo" or "the sun behind the sun," represented by the hawk god Horus
* Identification with po tolo reveals that the world is turning on a spiral
* Similarity between spiraling orbits of Sirius, Digitaria, and the neuromelanin foci in the brain stem
* Zulu shaman Vusamazulu Credo Mutwa described a "secret chain" between inner worlds and outer stars

**Kemetic Egyptians and Spirit Travel**
* Kemetic Egyptians experimented with spirit travel through initiation at temples and pyramids on the Giza plateau
* Great Pyramid has precise ventilation shafts tracking orbital life of specific stars
* Innermost human soul correlated with the orbiting stars
* Neurophysiological substrate for these claims may exist in neuromelanin-rich absorption spectrum areas in the brain core

**Neuromelanin Foci and Stellar Connections**
* Twelve neuromelanin foci in deep brain, Amenta nerve tract, and orbit of Sirius reflect larger phenomenon
* Millions of potential configurations for neuromelanin foci throughout the brain
* Inner gestalt patterns align with shifting matrix of stars as they develop in the womb
* Access to solar ambience through subtle or light body

**Neurodynamics and Conscious Evolution**
* Neurogenesis continues in numerous regions of the brain, not just dentate gyrus
* New cells can be selected and stimulated through psychospiritual development
* Brain can be reprogrammed by conscious intentionality
* Experiences expand subtle ideation and perception beyond language
* Higher levels of intuitive mind and overmind open perception of space between three-dimensional reality and fifth dimension.

##### Cosmic Consciousness: Neurocosmology and Ancient Wisdom

**Neurocosmology and Star Alignments**
* Avatar descends from higher realms, liberates us from matter and gravity
* Initiations in Kemetic Egypt linked to specific star groupings and temple/pyramid sites
* Attempt to awaken initiate's neurocosmology with brain activity
* Unique soul gestalt of star alignments reflects inner neural density
* Lost science of the stars: unique to each soul, not special
* Earth's core rotational dynamics create matrix for electro-magnetic and gravitational energies
* Light is a fifth-dimensional force, gravity direct experience of space-time curve
* Awakened energy body travels curved highway between dimensions
* Soul must participate in something greater to travel the pathways
* Crumpling or coiling of space between remote objects/regions allows travel to distant spaces and dimensions

**Ancient Knowledge of Stars and Galactic Expanses**
* Ancients gathered knowledge through meditation, shamanic journeys, underworld travels
* Verified by modern authorities despite being seen as arcane
* Found in temples and astronomical observatory ruins (e.g., Napta Playa)
* Lost methodology partially based on neurocosmology: "sun behind the sun" resonates with "body behind the body"

**Consciousness Beyond the Body and Mind**
* Consciousness may not be limited to interior self
* May be exterior as well, bathed in nonlocal consciousness
* All forms of matter may manifest consciousness
* Quantum vacuum and dark matter potentially conscious
* Ancient ruins and traditions represent advanced star knowledge
* Implications stretch comprehension, unfathomable.

#### METHODOLOGY: ELEVEN DIRECTIONS AND THE WILL TO GOD

**Methodology: Eleven Directions and the Will to God**

**Preparation**:
- Lie down or recline at a moderate angle in a comfortable, semidark, quiet room
- Repeat clear affirmations and willingness to trust and travel
- Relax physical body until sensory and somatic boundaries are blurred

**Directions of Travel**:
1. **Northward**
2. **Southward**
3. **Eastward**
4. **Westward**
5. **Upward**
6. **Downward**
7. **Inward**
8. **Outward**
9. **Past**
10. **Future**
11. **Present**

**Technique**:
- Relax physical body deeply and blur boundaries with external environment
- Generate sense of internal rotation within the "I" experience
- Visualize Earth's core rotating, stabilizing objects or forms in a general plane of experience
- Repeat affirmations and judge own validity of experiences.

**Additional Considerations**:
- Conceive gravity as warping space-time and enfolding dimensions
- Fly through spaces upon completion for further exploration
- Repeat affirmations, such as "I am a child of God" or "Let me flow through the dimensions."

#### BODILY TRANSFORMATION AND HEALING

**Bodily Transformation and Healing**

**Spiritual Attainment**:
- Spirit resides in physical body, accessing higher realms through spiritual practices
- Subtle brain centers are opened, celestial pathways fuse with emergent neural circuitry
- Bodily life is a "dense dream of forms, storms, and liquids"
- Organs and bodily systems appear as symbols of the sublime spiritual process

**Neurogenesis and Healing Evolution**:
- Neurogenesis directed by consciousness for healing evolution of the community
- Warm dark living matter in brain's interior, surface, and "Cave of Brahma"
- Dynamically evolving brain reflects vast unfolding cosmos

**Homo Noeticus and Spiritual Development**:
- Brain template becomes attuned to luminous formative structures of the cosmos
- Evolution leads to "Homo noeticus" stage of human development
- Transition to beings of light in the distant future

**Spiritual Healing and Transferred Consciousness**:
- Spiritual healing at a distance becomes continual
- Soul retrieval becomes an exacting science, rather than sporadic and dangerous
- Transferred consciousness (phowa) is fully realized

**Transcendence and Communion with Beings of Light**:
- Luminosity replaces ideation, potential subsumes manifestations of energy
- Absolute freedom through transcendence of material existence
- Return to the Duat in the "winding waters of the Milky Way"
- Communion with angelic forms

#### LUMINOSITY VERSUS IDEATION

**Luminosity Versus Ideation**

**Changes in Vision and Perception:**
- Vision becomes more spherical
- Seeing in many directions simultaneously
- Inside and outside of things
- Beyond Descartes' res cognitas and res extensa
- Lifted veil between earthly life and spiritual life (apocalypse)

**Thought and Ideation:**
- Thoughts become supple, blend seamlessly in experience
- Transmission of knowledge from more evolved beings
- Nonlocal reality of consciousness
- Evolution draws us into cosmic consciousness
- Beyond conceptualization of God

**Individual Evolution:**
- Recognizing unique life as part of evolution of cosmic soul
- Helpers of humanity and souls wandering on after-death planes
- Tillers of the soil for species beyond earthly conceptualization of God
- Becoming teachers and mentors to new civilizations

**Human Soul's Role:**
- Avatar in cosmic drama of spiritual evolution
- Spirit guide to fledgling souls and civilizations.

#### COMMUNION

**The Divine Estate and Universal Communion**

**Transcendence of Conceptualization**:
- In the Divine estate, there is constant communion with the great Beings of the cosmos
- Individual capacity for subject or object, duality, limited concepts dissolve towards luminosity
- Conceptualization itself dissolves and becomes subsumed by luminosity

**Beings from Higher Realms**:
- Beings appear to descend into our dimension from higher enfolded realities
- One becomes "at-one-ment" with the great Beings of the universe

**The Christ's Teachings on the Cosmos**:
- The cosmos were generated for 12 angels to rule over chaos and the underworld
- Each human soul, when fully realized, becomes the avatar of a new world
- The great soul awakens and transcends the curious episode in matter
- Return/descent into the universe of space, time, matter, and embodiment is an adventure in light and compassion.

**The Root Work**:
- This is the root work, the ground soil, the great trunk of a spiraling tree
- Spiritual disciplines and traditions are like fallen leaves from this root work
