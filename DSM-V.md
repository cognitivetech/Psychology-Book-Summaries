* DSM has been criticized for not yielding fully validated diagnoses
* Science of mental disorders continues to evolve with research advances in cognitive neuroscience, brain imaging, epidemiology, genetics
* Balancing speculative results and evolution of DSM is crucial
* DSM-5 designed to better serve clinicians, patients, families, researchers
* Clinical expertise needed for diagnosis; diagnostic criteria identify symptoms, behaviors, etc. that require differentiation from normal life variation
* Many mental disorders have fluid boundaries between categories and share symptoms, risk factors, and neural substrates
* Involvement of various healthcare professionals and patient organizations in DSM-5 development and testing.

###### A Brief History

**DSM History and Revision Process**

**Background:**
- APA published first DSM in 1844 as a mental patient classification system
- DSM evolved through four major editions, with the latest being DSM-5 (2013)
- Designed to improve communication among mental health professionals and inform treatment decisions

**DSM-5 Revision Process:**
- APA evaluated strengths and weaknesses of DSM in 1999
- Coordinated with WHO, World Psychiatric Association, and NIMH for research agenda monograph (2002)
- Cooperative agreement from 2003 to 2008 funded conferences to prepare for revisions in both DSM-5 and ICD-11
- David J. Kupfer and Darrel A Regier appointed as Chair and Vice-Chair of the DSM-5 Task Force (2006)
- Members were vetted for conflicts of interest, with full disclosure on a Web site
- The task force and work groups developed new diagnostic criteria, posted drafts online for public comment, and conducted field trials before finalizing revisions.

###### Proposals for Revisions

**Proposals for DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria Revisions:**
- Developed by work groups based on rationale, scope of change, clinical impact, research evidence, clarity, and utility
- Encompass changes to diagnostic criteria, addition/deletion of disorders/subtypes/specifiers
- Identified strengths and weaknesses in current criteria and nosology
- Novel scientific findings over past two decades considered for potential changes through literature reviews and secondary data analyses
- Four guiding principles: feasibility for clinical practice, research evidence, continuity with previous editions, no a priori constraints on change between DSM-IV and DSM-5.
- Work groups identified key issues within diagnostic areas, examined methodological concerns, and considered revision of "not otherwise specified" disorders
- Proposals in Section II informed by advantages/disadvantages for public health and clinical utility, strength of evidence, magnitude of change
- New diagnoses, disorder subtypes, and specifiers subject to additional stipulations like demonstration of reliability and diagnostic validity
- Disorders with low clinical utility and weak validity considered for deletion
- Conditions for Further Study in Section III contingent on empirical evidence, diagnostic reliability or validity, presence of clear clinical need, potential benefit in advancing research.

###### DSM-5 Field Trials

**DSM-5 Field Trials**
* Designed to demonstrate reliability of DSM-5 diagnoses in various settings
* Two distinctive designs used: large medical-academic sites and routine clinical practices
* Medical-academic trials tested reliability, feasibility, and clinical utility of select revisions
* 11 North American sites participated, assessing a variety of patient populations
* Stratified samples identified for specific disorders and all other diagnoses
* Clinicians blinded to previous diagnoses conducted interviews and determined DSM-5 diagnoses
* Precision of reliability estimates assessed using intraclass kappa and correlation coefficients
* Prevalence rates of both DSM-IV and DSM-5 conditions calculated
* Routine clinical practice trials provided exposure to proposed DSM-5 diagnoses and measures for a wide range of clinicians.

###### Public and Professional Review

**Public and Professional Review of DSM-5**

**APA Launches Web Site (2010)**:
- All draft diagnostic criteria and proposed changes were posted for 2-month comment period
- Feedback totaled over 8,000 submissions, systematically reviewed by work groups
- Revisions to initial drafts made after first posting in 2011

**Second Posting (2011)**:

**Assembly and Board Approval (2012)**:
- Preliminary review by executive committees
- Assembly recommended publication in November 2012
- APA Board of Trustees approved publication in December 2012

###### Organizational Structure

**DSM-5 Overview:**
* Operationalized sets of diagnostic criteria serve as core for DSM-5
* Criteria have undergone scientific review but organization not significant until now
* Challenges: high comorbidity rates, excessive use of NOS criteria, and integration with scientific findings
* Initial plan to enhance clinical utility and facilitate scientific investigation through organizational restructuring
* Critical to maintain respect for state of science and avoid overly rapid change
* Reform approached as conservative, evolutionary process guided by emerging evidence
* Section II: official diagnostic criteria with potential modifications based on future research
* Section III: conditions for further study where scientific evidence is lacking or insufficient for widespread clinical use.

**DSM-5 Objectives:**
* Enhance clinical utility and facilitate scientific investigation through organizational restructuring
* Respect state of science and avoid overly rapid change
* Stimulate new clinical perspectives, encourage research on cross-cutting factors.

**Challenges:**
* High rates of comorbidity within and across DSM chapters
* Excessive use and need for NOS criteria
* Difficulty integrating DSM disorders with results from scientific studies.

**Proposed Solutions:**
* Reorganizing existing disorders to stimulate new clinical perspectives, encourage research on cross-cutting factors
* Create common language for communication between clinicians about diagnosis of disorders (Section II)
* Encourage ongoing review process and modification based on future research.

**Section III:**
* Includes diagnostic criteria that lack scientific evidence for widespread clinical use
* Highlights evolution and direction of scientific advances in these areas to stimulate further research.

**Personality Disorders:**
* Included in both Sections II and III
* Section II: update of existing text from DSM-IV-TR
* Section III: proposed research model for personality disorder diagnosis and conceptualization developed by the DSM-5 Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group.

###### Harmonization With ICD-11

**Harmonization of ICD-11 and DSM-5**

**Goals for Harmonization:**
- Overcome hindrances caused by multiple mental disorder classifications:
  * Collection and use of national health statistics
  * Designing clinical trials
  * Consideration of global applicability by international regulatory agencies
  - Reproduction of scientific results across national boundaries

**Shared Organizational Structure:**
- DSM-5 organization and proposed ICD-11 linear structure endorsed by NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project
- Helped integrate work groups and focus on scientific issues
- Initial overall structures of both projects consistent

**Disagreements:**
- Principaled differences on classification of psychopathology and specific criteria for disorders
- Most disparities reflect historical byproducts of independent committee processes
- Future discoveries may change placement or contours of individual disorders

**Placement of Disorders:**
- Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) placed with neurodevelopmental disorders based on patterns of symptoms, comorbidity, and shared risk factors
- Issues settled by preponderance of evidence
- Simple and linear organization may not fully capture complexity and heterogeneity of mental disorders

**ICD Classification Systems:**
- Official coding system in the US at DSM-5 release: International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)
- ICD-10-CM scheduled for implementation in the US in October 2014
- Decided to focus harmonization efforts on ICD-11 instead of ICD-10 due to impending release and anticipated DSM-5 organizational structure
- Both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes indicated for each disorder in the manual.

###### Dimensional Approach to Diagnosis

**Dimensional Approach to Diagnosis**

**Structural Problems with DSM-5**:
- Narrow diagnostic categories in the previous DSM system have emerged as issues in clinical practice and research
- Evidence comes from studies on comorbidity, need for NOS diagnoses (Not Otherwise Specified), and genetic/environmental risk factors
- Categorical structure of DSM did not capture:
  - Sharing of symptoms and risk factors across disorders
  - Widespread heterogeneity within disorders
  - Significant symptom overlap between multiple disorders

**Recommendations for New DSM-5 Diagnostic Approach**:
- **Cluster disorders based on shared neural substrates, family traits, genetic risk factors, specific environmental risks, biomarkers, temperamental antecedents, abnormalities of emotional or cognitive processing, symptom similarity, course of illness, high comorbidity, and shared treatment response**
- **Document this through a series of papers published in Psychological Medicine**
- Enable future research to enhance understanding of disease origins and pathophysiological commonalities between disorders
- Adapt DSM-5 to be a "living document" that can incorporate new discoveries in neurobiology, genetics, and epidemiology

**Organizational Structure of DSM-5**:
- Cluster disorders into **internalizing** (anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms) and **externalizing** (impulsive, disruptive conduct, substance use) groups based on:
  - Sharing of genetic and environmental risk factors
  - Systematic comorbidities seen in clinical and community samples
- Placement of these groups next to each other should aid in developing new diagnostic approaches, including **dimensional** approaches
- Keep current categorical approach as a "bridge" while encouraging research across current diagnostic categories

###### Developmental and Lifespan Considerations

**DSM-5 Organization Based on Developmental and Lifespan Considerations:**

**Approach**:
- Organized to reflect developmental processes
- Beginning: Neurodevelopmental disorders (early life)
- Middle: Bipolar, depressive, anxiety disorders (adolescence & young adulthood)
- End: Neurocognitive disorders and other diagnoses (adulthood and later life)

**Benefits**:
- Facilitates use of lifespan information for decision making
- Encourages further study on underlying pathophysiological processes
- Arranges disorder clusters to mirror clinical reality
- Helps non-mental health specialists identify potential diagnoses

**Proposed Organization of Chapters in DSM-5**:
1. Neurodevelopmental disorders
2. Internalizing disorders (emotional and somatic)
3. Externalizing disorders
4. Neurocognitive disorders
5. Other disorders

**Goals**:
- Provide better diagnostic concepts for research
- Serve as a useful guide to clinicians in explaining multiple or altered diagnoses over lifespan.

###### Cultural Issues

**Cultural Considerations and Mental Disorders**

**Background:**
- Mental disorders are defined by cultural norms and values
- Culture shapes experience and expression of symptoms
- Diagnostic assessment must consider individual's experiences from sociocultural perspective

**Concepts in DSM-5:**
1. **Cultural Syndrome:** group of invariant symptoms found in a specific culture, may or may not be recognized as an illness
2. **Cultural Idiom of Distress:** linguistic term used to describe shared concepts of pathology and ways of expressing distress within a cultural group
3. **Cultural Explanation:** label or attribution for the etiology or cause of symptoms, illness, or distress in a specific culture

**Gender Differences:**
- Biological sex vs. gender differences: nomenclature uses gender differences when both biological sex and self-representation are involved; some differences based on only biological sex
- Gender influences illness expression, help seeking, clinical presentations, expectations of treatment, illness adaptation, and treatment response
- Attention to gender in DSM-5 through diagnostic criteria, gender-related specifiers, and issues relevant to diagnosis.

**Impact of Culture:**
- Variation between normality and pathology across cultures for specific behaviors
- Different thresholds of tolerance for symptoms or behaviors across cultures
- Judgment of abnormal behavior depends on cultural norms
- Cultural meanings, habits, traditions can contribute to stigma or support in social response to mental illness
- Culture affects clinical encounter accuracy and acceptance of diagnosis, treatment decisions, prognostic considerations, and clinical outcomes.

###### Use of Other Specified and Unspecified Disorders

**Changes to Diagnostic System in DSM-5**

**Other Specified Disorder**:
- Replaces NOS designation
- Allows clinician to communicate specific reason presentation does not meet criteria for any specific category within a diagnostic class
- Record name of category, followed by specific reason (e.g., "other specified depressive disorder, depressive episode with insufficient symptoms")
- If clinician chooses not to specify, "unspecified disorder" is diagnosed

**Unspecified Disorder**:
- Given when clinician cannot further specify and describe clinical presentation

**Multiaxial System in DSM-5**:
- Nonaxial documentation of diagnosis (formerly Axes I, II, III)
- Separate notation for important psychosocial and contextual factors (formerly Axis IV)
- Combined Axis III with Axes I and II

**Psychosocial and Environmental Problems**:
- DSM-IV's Axis IV covered problems affecting diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of mental disorders
- DSM-5 uses a selected set of the ICD-9-CM V codes and new Z codes contained in ICD-10-CM
- WHODAS (version 2.0) and a modification for children/adolescents included for further study

**Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF)**:
- Included in DSM-IV to represent overall "functioning on a hypothetical continuum of mental health-illness"
- Lack of clarity and questionable psychometrics led to its removal from DSM-5

###### Onlin e Enhancements

**DSM-5 Print Edition Limitations and Online Enhancements**
* Challenging to determine most clinically relevant content for print version
* Limited inclusion of clinical rating scales and measures in the print edition
* Additional assessment measures used during field trials available online (www.psychiatry.org/dsm5)
* Cultural Formulation Interview, Cultural Formulation Interview-Informant Version, and core Cultural Formulation Interview supplementary modules also accessible at www.psychiatry.org/dsm5
* DSM-5 available as an online subscription at PsychiatryOnline.org and e-book
* Online component includes diagnostic criteria text enhancements and assessment tools
* Complete set of supportive references and additional helpful information accessible online
* Organizational structure, use of dimensional measures, and compatibility with ICD codes allow for future scientific discoveries and clinical utility improvements.

### Use of the Manual

**DSM-5 Practical Guide**

**Introduction**:
- History and development of DSM-5 revision
- Primary purpose: assist clinicians in mental disorder diagnosis for treatment plans

**Approach to Clinical Case Formulation**:
- Careful clinical history, social, psychological, biological factors
- Checking diagnostic criteria but considering severity and contribution
- Recognizing when predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, protective factors have resulted in psychopathology

**Definition of a Mental Disorder (excluding "Medication-Induced Movement Disorders" and "Other Conditions")**:
- Syndrome with clinically significant disturbance in cognition, emotion regulation, behavior
- Reflects dysfunction in psychological, biological, or developmental processes
- Associated with distress or disability impacting social, occupational activities
- Not equivalent to treatment need, which involves symptom severity, salience, and other factors
- Clinical utility: determining prognosis, treatment plans, potential outcomes

**Validating Diagnostic Criteria**:
- Antecedent validators: genetic markers, family traits, environment exposure
- Concurrent validators: neural substrates, biomarkers, emotional processing, symptom similarity
- Predictive validators: clinical course and treatment response

**Current Diagnostic Criteria Limitations**:
- May not identify homogeneous patient groups with all validators
- Most important standard: clinical utility for assessing clinical course, treatment response

**Definition of Mental Disorder (Legal Purposes)**:
- Additional information required beyond DSM-5 criteria for legal judgments on criminal responsibility, disability compensation, competency. See "Cautionary Statement for Forensic Use of DSM-5".

###### Criterion for Ciinical Significance

**Mental Disorder vs. Disability**

**WHO Classification System**:
- **International Classification of Diseases (ICD)**: Covers all diseases and disorders
- **International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)**: Provides a separate classification of global disability

**Measurement of Disability for Mental Disorders**:
- **WHODAS (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule)**: A standardized measure of disability based on ICF
- Limitations in using WHODAS:
  - No clear biological markers or clinically useful measures of severity for many mental disorders
  - Gap between normal and pathological symptom expressions in diagnostic criteria

**Establishing Disorder Thresholds**:
- **Generic diagnostic criterion**: Requiring "clinically significant distress or impairment"
  - Worded as "the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning"
  - Helps determine a patient's need for treatment
- Use of information from family members and third parties, if necessary, to assess the individual's performance

###### Elements of a Diagnosis

**Diagnostic Criteria and Descriptors**
- Diagnostic criteria serve as guidelines for making diagnoses based on clinical judgment
- Text descriptions provide support, including introductory sections, differential diagnoses, and more detailed explanations of diagnostic features
- When full criteria are not met, consider "other specified" or "unspecified" designation
- Severity, course specifiers apply when full criteria are met
- Clinical interview, text descriptions, and judgment used to make final diagnosis
- Multiple diagnoses allowed for presentations meeting criteria for more than one DSM-5 disorder

**Subtypes and Specifiers**
- Subtypes: mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive phenomenological subgroupings within a diagnosis, indicated by "Specify whether" in the criteria set
- Specifiers: not mutually exclusive or jointly exhaustive, multiple specifiers can be given, indicated by "Specify" or "Specify if" in the criteria set
- Subtypes and specifiers provide more homogeneous subgroupings for disorder management
- Cannot be coded within ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM systems in most cases
- Indicated by including the subtype or specifier after the name of the disorder
- Severity, course, and descriptive features specifiers may be listed after diagnosis, indicated by "Specify current severity" or "Specify..." in criteria set

**Other Conditions Relevant to Mental Health Clinicians**
- Section II includes conditions not mental disorders that may be encountered by mental health clinicians
- Separate chapter for medication-induced disorders and other adverse effects of medication, including akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, dystonia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and antidepressant discontinuation syndrome
- Other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention include relational problems, abuse/neglect, treatment adherence issues, obesity, antisocial behavior, and malingering.

###### Principal Diagnosis

**Principal Diagnosis vs Reason for Visit**
- **Inpatient Setting**: The principal diagnosis is the condition established as chiefly responsible for admission.
- **Outpatient Setting**: The reason for visit is the condition chiefly responsible for medical services received during the visit.
- When both a mental disorder and another medical condition are present, list the etiological medical condition first if it's the principal diagnosis or reason for visit per coding rules.
- Use "provisional" when there's strong suspicion but not enough information to make a firm diagnosis.

**Coding Procedures**
- Each disorder has an identifying code (ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM) used for data collection and billing purposes.
- Follow specific recording protocols established by WHO, CMS, and NCHS to ensure consistent international recording of health conditions.
- Clinicians use these codes for CMS and private insurance service claims in the US (official adoption of ICD-10-CM is scheduled for 2014).

**Assessment and Monitoring Tools**
- Various components of DSM-5 aim to facilitate patient assessment and inform diagnosis and treatment.
- Assessment tools, cultural formulation interview, and conditions for further study in Section III are not yet clinically validated but can aid in comprehensive evaluation and monitoring symptoms/diagnosis.

### Cautionary Statement for Forensic Use of DSM-5

**DSM-5 Use in Forensic Settings: Cautionary Statement**

**Importance of DSM-5 for Legal Decision Making**:
- DSM-5 is used as a reference by courts and attorneys to assess forensic consequences of mental disorders
- Diagnoses and diagnostic information can enhance the value and reliability of legal determinations (e.g., involuntary civil commitment)
- DSM-5 may facilitate legal decision makers' understanding of relevant characteristics of mental disorders
- Literature related to diagnoses serves as a check on ungrounded speculation about mental disorders and individual functioning
- Diagnostic information about longitudinal course can improve decision making regarding past or future mental functioning

**Limitations of DSM-5 in Forensic Settings**:
- Clinical diagnosis does not necessarily imply legal criteria for the presence of a mental disorder or specific legal standards (e.g., competence, criminal responsibility, disability)
- Additional information beyond the clinical diagnosis is often required to assess these legal issues
- Impairments, abilities, and disabilities vary widely within each diagnostic category
- **Non-clinical** decision makers should not use DSM-5 diagnoses to assess for the presence of a mental disorder
- Diagnosis does not carry any necessary implications regarding etiology or degree of control over behaviors associated with the disorder, even when diminished control is a feature of the disorder

## Section II. Diagnostic Criteria and Codes

**Overview**:
- Includes diagnostic criteria approved for clinical use and ICD-9-CM codes (in parentheses)
- Descriptive text to aid in diagnostic decision making
- Recording procedures provided to guide code selection

**Mental Disorders**:
- Diagnostic criteria followed by descriptive text
- Separate recording procedures for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM as needed

**Additional Clinical Conditions**:
- Medication-induced movement disorders and other medication adverse effects
  - Indicate reasons for a clinical visit, like environmental factors or relational problems
- Adapted from ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, not officially approved as DSM-5 diagnoses
- Can provide context for clinical formulation and treatment plan

**Components of Clinical Diagnosis**:
- **Diagnostic Criteria and Descriptive Text**: Key elements in the diagnostic process
- **Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Adverse Effects of Medication**: Additional conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention
- **Descriptions of Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention**: Indicate other reasons for a clinical visit, like environmental factors or relational problems.

### Neurodevelopmental Disorders

**Neurodevelopmental Disorders:**
* Group of conditions with onset during developmental period
* Manifest early in life, often before entering grade school
* Characterized by developmental deficits impairing personal, social, academic or occupational functioning
* Range from specific learning disorders to global intellectual impairments
* Frequently co-occur with other neurodevelopmental and mental disorders
* Diagnostic criteria may include symptoms of excess as well as deficits and delays in achieving milestones

**Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder):**
* Deficits in general mental abilities, such as reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience
* Impairments of adaptive functioning, including communication, social participation, academic or occupational functioning, and personal independence
* May result from acquired injuries during developmental period, leading to neurocognitive disorders

**Communication Disorders:**
* Language disorder: deficits in the development and use of language
* Speech sound disorder: problems with speech production and perception
* Social (pragmatic) communication disorder: difficulties using social communication skills
* Childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering): disturbances of normal fluency and motor production of speech
* Begin early in life, may produce lifelong functional impairments

**Autism Spectrum Disorder:**
* Persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts
* Deficits in social reciprocity, nonverbal communicative behaviors, and skills in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships
* Requires presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities
* Diagnostic criteria may be met based on historical information, although current presentation must cause significant impairment

**Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD):**
* Impairing levels of inattention, disorganization, and hyperactivity-impulsivity
* Inconsistent with age or developmental level
* May persist into adulthood, causing impairments in social, academic, and occupational functioning

**Neurodevelopmental Motor Disorders:**
* Developmental coordination disorder: deficits in acquisition and execution of motor skills
* Stereotypic movement disorder: repetitive, seemingly driven motor behaviors interfering with activities
* Tic disorders: presence of motor or vocal tics that cause functional impairments
* Tourette's disorder: multiple motor and vocal tics for at least one year with waxing-waning symptom course

**Specific Learning Disorder:**
* Diagnosed during formal schooling years
* Persistent and impairing difficulties in learning foundational academic skills (reading, writing, math)
* Performance is well below average for age or acceptable only with extraordinary effort
* Can produce lifelong impairments in occupational performance
* Use of specifiers to describe clinical presentation and etiological factors.

#### Intellectual Disabilities 
##### Intellectual Disabilities (Intellectual Developmental Disorders)
- Definition: A disorder with onset during developmental period affecting intellectual and adaptive functioning
- Criteria for Diagnosis
  - **A. Deficits in intellectual functions**: Reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, learning from experience (confirmed by clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence testing)
  - **B. Deficits in adaptive functioning**: Failure to meet developmental and socio-cultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility; limiting functioning in areas of communication, social participation, independent living across multiple environments
  - **C. Onset during the developmental period**
- Terminology: Intellectual disability is equivalent term for ICD-11 diagnosis of intellectual developmental disorders; also known as mental retardation or intellectual developmental disorder (IDD)
  *Note*: The diagnostic term intellectual disability is used throughout this manual, but both terms are used to clarify relationships with other classification systems. In the US, Public Law 111-256 replaced "mental retardation" with "intellectual disability." Research journals also use intellectual disability.
- Coding System: ICD-9-CM code for IDD is **319**, assigned regardless of severity specifier; ICD-10-CM codes depend on the severity specifier (see below)
- Severity Specifiers:
  - Mild
  - Moderate
  - Severe
  - Profound

**Severity Definitions**: Adaptive functioning determines level of supports required; IQ measures less valid in lower end of IQ range.

###### TABLE 1

**Table 1: Severity Levels for Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder)**

**Severity level** **Conceptual domain** **Social domain** **Practical domain**

**Mild**
- Preschool children: function age-appropriately, immature in social personal care
- Difficulties perceiving peers' social cues, judgment
- Support needed for daily living tasks and academic skills

**Moderate**
- Marked differences from peers in conceptual skills, relationships, participation in household tasks
- Limited understanding of abstract thinking, executive function
- Extended period of teaching required for skill development

**Severe**
- Lack of understanding of written language or symbolic processes
- Limited spoken language vocabulary and grammar
- Dependent on others for daily physical care and health/safety needs

**Profound**
- Limited conceptual skills, use of objects in goal-directed fashion
- Spoken language is single words or phrases
- Relationships with family members and familiar others are a source of pleasure
- Dependent on others for all aspects of daily physical care.

###### Diagnostic Features

**Criteria for Intellectual Disability (ID)**

**Essential Features:**
- Deficits in general mental abilities (Criterion A)
  * Reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment
  - Verbal comprehension, working memory, perceptual reasoning, quantitative reasoning, abstract thought, cognitive efficacy
  * Individually administered and psychometrically valid tests used for diagnosis
- Impairment in everyday adaptive functioning (Criterion B)
  * Personal independence and social responsibility
  * Adaptive reasoning: conceptual, social, practical domains
    **Conceptual**
      * Memory, language, reading, writing, math reasoning, knowledge acquisition
    **Social**
      * Awareness of others' thoughts/feelings, empathy, interpersonal communication skills
    **Practical**
      * Learning and self-management across life settings (personal care, job responsibilities, money management, etc.)
  * Assessed using clinical evaluation and individualized measures
- Onset during developmental period (Criterion C)

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- Intellectual functions measured with culturally appropriate tests
  * Scores approximately two standard deviations below population mean
  * Clinical judgment required to interpret test results
- Adaptive functioning impaired in at least one domain, requiring ongoing support

**Associated Features:**
- Social judgment, assessment of risk, self-management difficulties or motivation issues
- Lack of communication skills leading to disruptive behaviors
- Gullibility and naivety in social situations
- Increased risk for accidental injury, suicidal thoughts/attempts, and victimization.

###### Prevalence

**Prevalence of Intellectual Disability**
- Approximately 1% general population prevalence
- Varies by age: severe intellectual disability is approximately 6 per 1,000
- Developmental period onset for most cases
- Delayed milestones in early childhood for more severe cases
- All criteria must be fulfilled by history or current presentation

**Characteristics of Intellectual Disability**
- Nonprogressive, but some genetic disorders may have periods of worsening or progressive deterioration
- Lifelong disorder, although severity levels can change over time
- Course influenced by underlying medical or genetic conditions and co-occurring conditions (e.g., hearing or visual impairments, epilepsy)
- Early interventions can improve adaptive functioning throughout childhood and adulthood
- Diagnosis may not be appropriate if significant improvement with supports and ongoing interventions

**Risk and Prognostic Factors for Intellectual Disability**
- **Genetic and physiological causes**: prenatal (genetic syndromes, inborn errors of metabolism, brain malformations), perinatal (neonatal encephalopathy), postnatal (hypoxic ischemic injury, traumatic brain injury, infections, demyelinating disorders, seizure disorders, severe and chronic social deprivation, toxic metabolic syndromes and intoxications)
- **Cultural sensitivity**: intellectual disability occurs in all races and cultures; assessment must account for ethnic, cultural, linguistic background, experiences, and adaptive functioning within the community and cultural setting
- **Gender differences**: males more likely to be diagnosed with both mild (1.6:1 average ratio) and severe (1.2:1 average ratio) forms of intellectual disability; gender ratios vary widely in reported studies

**Components of Intellectual Disability Evaluation**
- Assessment of intellectual capacity and adaptive functioning
- Identification of genetic and non-genetic etiologies
- Evaluation for associated medical conditions (e.g., cerebral palsy, seizure disorder)
- Evaluation for co-occurring mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders
- Basic prenatal and perinatal medical history
- Three-generational family pedigree
- Physical examination
- Genetic evaluation (e.g., karyotype or chromosomal microarray analysis, testing for specific genetic syndromes)
- Metabolic screening and neuroimaging assessment.

###### Differential Diagnosis

**Intellectual Disability Diagnosis**
- Criteria A, B, and C met for diagnosis
- Should not be assumed based on genetic or medical condition
- Distinct from neurocognitive disorders
- Major neurocognitive disorder may co-occur with intellectual disability
  * Note as concurrent diagnoses if both full criteria are met
- Communication disorders and specific learning disorder may co-occur with intellectual disability
  * Make both diagnoses if full criteria are met for each
- Autism spectrum disorder common among individuals with intellectual disability
  * Assess intellectual ability despite communication/behavioral deficits
  * Appropriate assessment necessary due to potential instability of IQ scores, especially in early childhood

**Co-occurring Conditions in Intellectual Disability**
- High frequency of co-occurring mental and neurodevelopmental conditions
  * Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder
  * Depressive disorders (mild to severe)
  * Anxiety disorders
  * Autism spectrum disorder
  * Stereotypic movement disorder with or without self-injurious behavior
  * Impulse control disorders
  - Major neurocognitive disorder may occur
- Prognosis and outcome of co-occurring diagnoses influenced by intellectual disability presence
- Assessment procedures require modifications due to associated disorders
  * Knowledgeable informants essential for identifying symptoms, assessing adaptive functioning in various community settings.

##### Global Developmental Delay 315.8

**Global Developmental Delay (315.8+, F88)**
- For individuals under age 5 when clinical severity level cannot be reliably assessed during early childhood
- Diagnosed in individuals who fail to meet expected developmental milestones in several areas of intellectual functioning
- Applies to children unable to undergo systematic assessments, including those too young for standardized testing
- Requires reassessment after a period of time

##### Unspecified Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder (319)
- For individuals over age 5 when assessment of intellectual disability degree is difficult due to associated sensory or physical impairments or severe problem behaviors or co-occurring mental disorders
- Should only be used in exceptional circumstances and requires reassessment after a period of time.

#### Communication Disorders

**Disorders of Communication**
- Includes deficits in language, speech, and communication

**Speech**:
- Expressive production of sounds
- Individual's articulation, fluency, voice, and resonance quality

**Language**:
- Form, function, and use of a conventional system of symbols (spoken words, sign language, written words, pictures)
- Rule-governed manner for communication

**Communication**:
- Verbal or nonverbal behavior (intentional or unintentional) that influences the behavior, ideas, or attitudes of another individual

**Assessing Speech, Language and Communication Abilities**:
- Must take into account the individual's cultural and language context, particularly for individuals growing up in bilingual environments
- Standardized measures of language development and nonverbal intellectual capacity must be relevant to the cultural and linguistic group
- Tests developed and standardized for one group may not provide appropriate norms for a different group

**Diagnostic Categories**:
- **Language Disorder**
- **Speech Sound Disorder**
- **Childhood-onset Fluency Disorder (stuttering)**
- **Social (pragmatic) Communication Disorder**
- **Other Specified and Unspecified Communication Disorders**

##### Language Disorder (315.39)

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- Persistent difficulties in language acquisition across modalities due to deficits in comprehension or production
- Reduced vocabulary, limited sentence structure, and impairments in discourse
- Functional limitations in effective communication, social participation, academic achievement, occupational performance
- Onset of symptoms in early developmental period
- Not attributable to hearing, sensory, motor dysfunctions, or intellectual disability

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Difficulties with vocabulary, sentence structure, and discourse in spoken and written communication
- Impairments evident in expressive (production) and receptive (comprehension) abilities
- Problems with word retrieval, understanding synonyms, and following instructions
- Limited capacity for narrative and explanatory language
- Substantially below expected age level and interferes with functioning

**Associated Features**:
- Positive family history of language disorders
- Preference for communicating only with familiar individuals
- Co-occurrence with speech sound disorders

**Development and Course**:
- Emerges during early developmental period, with individual differences in vocabulary acquisition and word combinations
- Stable by age 4, predictive of later outcomes, persists into adulthood with changing profile

**Risk Factors**:
- Children with receptive language impairments have poorer prognosis than expressive ones
- Highly heritable, genetic and physiological factors contribute.

**Normal Variations vs. Language Disorder:**
- Difficulty distinguishing before age 4
- Consider regional, social, or cultural variations (dialects)

**Hearing Impairment:**
- Exclude primary cause of language difficulties
- Language deficits may be associated with other sensory deficits or speech-motor issues
- Separate diagnosis if language impairments exceed those usually associated with hearing problems

**Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder):**
- Language delay can be a presenting feature of intellectual disability
- Diagnosis not given unless language deficits are clearly in excess of intellectual limitations

**Neurological Disorders:**
- Language disorder may accompany neurological disorders, such as epilepsy (acquired aphasia or Landau-Kleffner syndrome)
- Language regression: loss of speech and language before age 3 could indicate autism spectrum disorder with developmental regression or specific neurological condition like Landau-Kleffner syndrome. Among children older than 3 years, it may be a symptom of seizures and requires diagnostic assessment to exclude epilepsy (routine electroencephalogram).

**Comorbidity**
- **Language Disorder**: associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders: specific learning disability (literacy and numeracy), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, developmental coordination disorder
- Also linked to **social (pragmatic) communication disorder**
- Positive family history of speech or language disorders often present.

##### Speech Sound Disorder (SSD) (315.39)

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- Persistent difficulty with speech sound production that interferes with speech intelligibility or prevents verbal communication of messages
- Causes limitations in effective communication that interfere with social participation, academic achievement, or occupational performance
- Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period
- Not attributable to congenital or acquired conditions (e.g., cerebral palsy, cleft palate, hearing loss)

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Impairment in speech sound production, not what would be expected based on age and developmental stage
- Not the result of physical, structural, neurological, or medical conditions
- Heterogeneous underlying mechanisms: phonological disorder or articulation disorder
- Typically developing children should have overall speech intelligibility by 4 years old

**Associated Features**:
- Language disorder, particularly expressive deficits, may co-occur with SSD
- Positive family history of speech or language disorders
- Delayed acquisition and coordination of skills involving articulators (e.g., chewing, blowing nose)
- Verbal dyspraxia
- Speech may be impaired in certain genetic conditions

**Developmental Processes**:
- Learning to produce speech sounds clearly and accurately is a developmental skill
- Articulation of speech sounds follows a developmental pattern, with age norms reflected in standardized tests
- Immaturity of phonological simplification processes past expected age for clear speech production

**Differentiation from Other Disorders**:
- Regional, social, or cultural variations of speech should be considered before making the diagnosis
- Hearing impairment, other sensory deficits, or neurological signs may indicate other disorders (e.g., dysarthria, selective mutism)
- Dysarthria differentiated from SSD by distinctive voice features and neurological signs, although difficult to differentiate in young children
- Selective mutism may be associated with speech disorder but characterized by lack of speech in specific contexts

**Prognosis**:
- Most children with speech sound disorder respond well to treatment, improving over time
- When a language disorder is also present, the prognosis is poorer and may be associated with specific learning disorders

##### Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering) (315.35)

**Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)**

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Disturbance in normal fluency and time patterning of speech for age
- Characterized by:
  - Sound and syllable repetitions
  - Sound prolongations of consonants and vowels
  - Broken words (pausing within a word)
  - Audible or silent blocking (filled or unfilled pauses in speech)
  - Circumlocutions (word substitutions to avoid problematic words)
  - Words produced with excess physical tension
  - Monosyllabic whole-word repetitions
- Interferes with communication, social participation, and academic/occupational performance
- Not attributable to speech motor or sensory deficits, neurological insults, or other mental disorders

**Associated Features**:
- Anxiety about speaking and limitations in effective communication
- Fearful anticipation of the problem
- Attempts to avoid dysfluencies through linguistic mechanisms or avoiding certain speech situations
- Stress and anxiety can exacerbate dysfluency
- May be accompanied by motor movements (e.g., eye blinks, tics, tremors)

**Onset and Course**:
- Onset typically by age 6 for 80%-90% of affected individuals, ranging from 2 to 7 years
- Can be insidious or more sudden
- Dysfluencies start gradually, then become more frequent and interfering
- Longitudinal research shows 65%-85% recover by age 8, with severity predicting persistence

**Risk Factors**:
- Genetic predisposition, physiological factors
- Risk of stuttering in first-degree relatives is more than three times the general population

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Distinguish from normal dysfluencies in children, medication side effects, adult-onset dysfluencies, and Tourette's disorder

##### Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder 315.39

**Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder (F80.89)**

A. **Symptoms**:
- Deficits in using communication for social purposes, such as greeting and sharing information, appropriately for the context
- Impairment of ability to change communication to match context or listener needs
- Difficulties following rules for conversation and storytelling (e.g., taking turns, rephrasing, using verbal/nonverbal signals)
- Problems understanding nonliteral, ambiguous language (idioms, humor, metaphors, context)

B. **Functional Limitations**:
- Effective communication
- Social participation
- Social relationships
- Academic achievement
- Occupational performance

C. **Onset and Exclusions**:
- Onset in early developmental period but not fully manifested until social demands exceed capacities
- Not attributable to another medical or neurological condition, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, global developmental delay, or other mental disorders

**Associated Features**:
- Language impairment (history of language delays and structural language problems)
- Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), behavioral problems, specific learning disorders

D. **Development and Course**:
- Rare in children under 4 years due to speech and language development prerequisites
- Milder forms may appear in early adolescence
- Outcome is variable, with some improving over time while others persist into adulthood

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Autism spectrum disorder (restricted/repetitive patterns of behavior)
- Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (impairs social communication and functions)
- Social anxiety disorder or social phobia (anxiety, fear, or distress about social interactions)
- Intellectual disability or global developmental delay (if symptoms exceed intellectual limitations)

##### Unspecified Communication Disorder (307.9)
- For presentations with symptoms characteristic of communication disorders causing distress/impairment without meeting full criteria for a specific diagnosis.

#### Autism Spectrum Disorder

##### Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (299)

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction**, manifested by:
  - Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity
  - Deficits in nonverbal communicative behavior for social interaction
  - Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships
- **Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities**, manifested by at least two of:
  - Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech
  - Insistence on sameness and inflexible adherence to routines
  - Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus
  - Hyper-or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects

**Diagnostic Considerations**:
- Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period
- Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
- These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability or global developmental delay

**Specifiers**:
- **With or without accompanying intellectual impairment**
- **With or without accompanying language impairment**
- Associated with a known medical or genetic condition or environmental factor
- Associated with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder
- With catatonia (if applicable)

**Recording Procedures**:
- Record autism spectrum disorder associated with (name of condition, disorder, or factor), if applicable
- Rate severity based on social communication impairments and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior
- Describe specifiers (e.g., "requiring very substantial support for deficits in social communication")

**Severity Specifiers**:
- Severity should not be used to determine eligibility or provision of services
- Separate estimates of verbal and nonverbal skills are necessary
- Receptive language may lag behind expressive language development
- Conditions like attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, developmental coordination disorder, anxiety disorders, etc., should be noted if applicable.

###### TABLE 2

**Severity Levels for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**

**Level 3: "Requiring Very Substantial Support"**
- Severe deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills
- Cause severe impairments in functioning
- Extremely limited initiation of social interactions
- Minimal response to social overtures from others
- For example, a person with few words or simple sentences who rarely initiates interaction and responds only to very direct approaches

**Level 2: "Requiring Substantial Support"**
- Marked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills
- Social impairments apparent even with supports in place
- Limited initiation of social interactions
- Reduced or abnormal responses to social overtures from others
- For example, a person who speaks simple sentences, engages in limited interaction, and has odd nonverbal communication

**Level 1: "Requiring Support"**
- Difficulty initiating social interactions
- Clear examples of atypical or unsuccessful responses to social overtures from others
- May appear to have decreased interest in social interactions
- For example, a person who can speak but fails to engage in effective conversation and has odd ways of making friends

**Restricted, Repetitive Behaviors:**
- Inflex flexibility of behavior
- Extreme difficulty coping with change
- Other restricted/repetitive behaviors markedly interfere with functioning in all spheres
- Great distress/difficulty changing focus or action
- For example, a person who experiences significant interference due to inflexibility of behavior or problems with organization and planning.

###### Diagnostic Criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder

**Essential Features of Autism Spectrum Disorder:**
* Persistent impairment in reciprocal social communication and interaction (Criterion A)
	+ Deficits in verbal and nonverbal communication for social interaction
	+ Impaired joint attention
	+ Absent or reduced eye contact, gestures, facial expressions, body orientation, or speech intonation
* Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities (Criterion B)
	+ Simple motor stereotypies and repetitive use of objects
	+ Repetitive speech (echolalia, delayed parroting, fixed phrases)
	+ Excessive adherence to routines and rigid thinking
	+ Highly restricted, fixated interests
* Symptoms present from early childhood and limit everyday functioning (Criteria C and D)
* Manifestations vary depending on severity, developmental level, and age.

**Diagnostic Approach:**
* Valid diagnoses based on multiple sources: clinician observations, caregiver history, self-report
* Diagnosis may be subtle or relatively obvious in individual modes of communication
* Impairments are pervasive and sustained across various situations
* Diagnostic criteria met even if symptoms no longer present (Criterion D)
* Social communication deficits exceed difficulties based on developmental level (Criterion E).

**Additional Features:**
* Intellectual or language impairment may be present but unevenly distributed
* Motor deficits, self-injury, disruptive behaviors common in children and adolescents
* Anxiety and depression are more prevalent than other disorders.

###### Autism Spectrum Disorder: Prevalence, Symptoms, and Prognosis

**Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**

**Prevalence**:
- Reported frequencies for ASD have approached 1% of the population in both U.S. and non-U.S. countries
- Similar estimates in child and adult samples
- Unclear if higher rates reflect:
  - Expansion of diagnostic criteria (DSM-IV)
  - Increased awareness
  - Differences in study methodology
  - True increase in ASD frequency

**Development and Course**:
- **Age of Onset**: Symptoms typically recognized during the second year of life (12-24 months)
- May also be seen earlier or later depending on severity of developmental delays
- Behavioral features first become evident in early childhood
- Some children experience developmental plateaus or regression, with gradual/rapid loss of social behaviors and language skills between 12-24 months
- Losses beyond social communication are rare and require extensive medical investigation

**First Symptoms**:
- Delayed language development
- Lack of social interest or unusual social interactions (e.g., pulling individuals by the hand without looking at them)
- Odd play patterns (carrying toys around but never playing with them)
- Unusual communication patterns (knowing alphabet but not responding to own name)

**Pattern of Onset**:
- Age and pattern of onset should be noted for ASD diagnosis
- Early developmental delays or losses of social and language skills may indicate ASD
- Gradual/rapid deterioration in social behaviors or language skills is a "red flag" for ASD
- Losses of skills beyond social communication (e.g., self-care, toileting) or after the second birthday are more unusual and require extensive investigation

**Autism Spectrum Disorder is Not Degenerative**:
- Typically, ASD does not worsen over time
- Developmental gains are typical in later childhood, especially in areas of increased interest and skills
- A small proportion may deteriorate behaviorally during adolescence, while most improve

**Functioning in Adulthood**:
- Fewer than one in three adults with ASD live and work independently
- Even those with lower levels of impairment may remain socially naive, vulnerable to anxiety/depression, and have difficulties organizing practical demands without aid
- Many adults report using compensation strategies and coping mechanisms to mask their difficulties

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**:
- Presence or absence of associated intellectual disability and language impairment (e.g., functional language by age 5) is the best established prognostic factor
- Epilepsy as a comorbid diagnosis is associated with greater intellectual disability and lower verbal ability
- Environmental factors, such as advanced parental age, low birth weight, or fetal exposure to valproate, may contribute to risk of ASD
- Genetic/physiological factors, including heritability estimates (37%-90%) and known genetic mutations (de novo copy number variants, de novo mutations in specific genes), play a role
- **Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues**: Cultural differences do not excuse marked impairments in social interaction, nonverbal communication, and relationships in individuals with ASD
- **Gender Differences**: Autism spectrum disorder is diagnosed 4 times more often in males than females
- Females may be more likely to have accompanying intellectual disability, suggesting that girls without language delays or functional impairments may go unrecognized

**Functional Consequences of ASD**:
- Lack of social and communication abilities can hamper learning, especially through social interaction or in settings with peers
- Insistence on routines and aversion to change, as well as sensory sensitivities, can interfere with daily life (e.g., eating, sleeping, routine care)
- Extreme difficulties in planning, organization, and coping with change negatively impact academic achievement
- During adulthood, these individuals may have difficulties establishing independence due to continued rigidity and difficulty with novelty
- Even without intellectual disability, many adults with ASD have poor adult psychosocial functioning (e.g., independent living, gainful employment)

###### Differential Diagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder vs Related Conditions

**Differential Diagnosis for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**

**Rett Syndrome:**
- Social interaction may be disrupted during regressive phase (1-4 years)
- Improvement of social communication skills post-regression
- Only consider ASD when all diagnostic criteria are met

**Selective Mutism:**
- Normal early development
- Exhibits appropriate communication skills in certain contexts
- Social reciprocity not impaired
- Language disorders and pragmatic communication disorder (if applicable) should be considered instead

**Language Disorders:**
- Problems with communication
- No abnormal nonverbal behavior or restricted, repetitive patterns

**Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder:**
- Impairment in social communication and interactions
- No restricted or repetitive behavior
- Diagnosis of ASD supersedes this when criteria are met

**Intellectual Disability:**
- Difficult to differentiate from ASD in young children
- Repetitive behavior occurs in some individuals with intellectual disability
- Diagnose ASD if there is significant impairment relative to nonverbal skills

**Stereotypic Movement Disorder:**
- Motor stereotypies a diagnostic characteristic of ASD
- Additional diagnosis not given when better explained by ASD

**Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD):**
- Abnormalities in attention and hyperactivity common in ASD
- Diagnose ADHD when attentional difficulties or hyperactivity exceed typical levels for mental age

**Schizophrenia:**
- Schizophrenia develops after a normal period, unlike ASD
- Hallucinations and delusions not features of ASD
- Clinicians must consider potential confusion regarding key symptoms

**Comorbidities:**
- Intellectual impairment and structural language disorder common in ASD
- When criteria for multiple disorders are met, both should be diagnosed

**Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with Comorbid Conditions:**
- May present challenges for differential diagnosis, especially when nonverbal or have language deficits
- Observe signs such as changes in sleep, eating, and challenging behavior to evaluate anxiety or depression
- Specific learning difficulties common; developmental coordination disorder and medical conditions associated with ASD should be noted.

#### Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

##### Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
* **A persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity**: Interferes with functioning or development, as characterized by:
  * **Inattention**: Six or more symptoms persist for at least 6 months to a degree inconsistent with developmental level and negatively impacts social and academic/occupational activities. Symptoms are not solely manifestations of oppositional behavior, defiance, hostility, or failure to understand tasks or instructions. For older adolescents and adults (age 17 and above), at least five symptoms required.
    * **Inattention Symptoms**:
      - Often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes
      - Often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities
      - Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly
      - Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities
      - Is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli (for older adolescents and adults, may include unrelated thoughts)
      * For older adolescents and adults: at least five symptoms are required
  * **Hyperactivity-Impulsivity**: Six or more symptoms persist for at least 6 months to a degree inconsistent with developmental level and negatively impacts social and academic/occupational activities. Symptoms are not solely manifestations of oppositional behavior, defiance, hostility, or failure to understand tasks or instructions. For older adolescents and adults (age 17 and above), at least five symptoms required.
    * **Hyperactivity-Impulsivity Symptoms**:
      - Often fidgets with or taps hands/feet or squirms in seat
      - Often leaves seat in situations where remaining seated is expected
      - Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is inappropriate (Note: In adults, may be limited to feeling restless)
      * For older adolescents and adults: may be experienced by others as being restless or difficult to keep up with
      - Often unable to play or engage in leisure activities quietly
      - Is often "on the go," acting as if "driven by a motor" (e.g., unable to be still for extended time)
      * Often talks excessively
      - Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed, cannot wait for turn in conversation
      - Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations, games, or activities; may start using other people's things without asking or receiving permission)
  * **B. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present prior to age 12 years.**
  * **C. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are present in two or more settings (e.g., at home, school, or work; with friends or relatives; in other activities).**
  * **D. There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of, social, academic, or occupational functioning.**
  * **E. The symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., mood disorder, anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder, personality disorder, substance intoxication or withdrawal).**
* **Specify whether:**
  * Combined presentation: If both Criterion A1 (inattention) and Criterion A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) are met for the past 6 months.
  * Predominantly inattentive presentation: If Criterion A1 (inattention) is met but Criterion A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) is not met for the past 6 months.
  * Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation: If Criterion A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) is met and Criterion A1 (inattention) is not met for the past 6 months.
* **Specify if:** in partial remission: When full criteria were previously met, fewer than the full criteria have been met for the past 6 months, and the symptoms still result in impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning.
* **Specify current severity:** Mild: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are present, and symptoms result in no more than minor impairments in social or occupational functioning. Moderate: Symptoms or functional impairment between "mild" and "severe" are present. Severe: Many symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis, or several symptoms that are particularly severe, are present, or the symptoms result in marked impairment in social or occupational functioning.

###### Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Diagnostic Features and Associated Characteristics

**Diagnostic Features of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**

**Essential Feature:**
- Persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity interfering with functioning or development

**Inattention:**
- Wandering off task, lack of persistence, difficulty sustaining focus, disorganized
- Not due to defiance or lack of comprehension

**Hyperactivity:**
- Excessive motor activity or fidgetiness when inappropriate
- Extreme restlessness or wearing others out (adults)
- Impulsivity: hasty actions without forethought, high potential for harm
  - Social intrusiveness (interrupting others excessively)
  - Making important decisions without consideration of long-term consequences

**Additional Features:**
- Manifestations present in more than one setting (home and school, work)
- Symptoms vary depending on context within a given setting
- Associated features: mild delays in language or motor development, low frustration tolerance, irritability, mood lability, academic/work performance impairment

**Impact of ADHD:**
- Increased risk of suicide attempts by early adulthood (in cases with comorbid disorders)

**Supporting Diagnosis:**
- No specific biological marker for ADHD
- Possible cognitive problems: attention, executive function, memory (but not diagnostic)
- Delayed posterior to anterior cortical maturation and reduced total brain volume on magnetic resonance imaging in rare cases.

###### Understanding the Progression of ADHD Symptoms Across Age Groups

**Prevalence of ADHD**
- About 5% of children and 2.5% of adults affected
- More common in boys than girls by a ratio of 1.6:1
- Diagnosis often made during elementary school years

**Manifestations of ADHD with Development**
- **Toddler stage**: Difficult to distinguish from normative behaviors, excessive motor activity observed
- **Preschool age**: Main manifestation is hyperactivity
- **Elementary school years**: Inattention becomes more prominent and impairing
- **Adolescence**: Hyperactive symptoms less common, replaced by fidgetiness, restlessness, impulsivity
- **Adulthood**: Persistent inattention, restlessness, impulsivity; some individuals remain relatively impaired.

**Stability of ADHD with Development**
- Relatively stable through early adolescence
- Some individuals have worsened course with development of antisocial behaviors
- Symptoms may lessen or change form but usually persist in some capacity.

###### Risk and Prognostic Factors

**ADHD: Risk Factors and Consequences**
* **Temperamental**:
  * Reduced behavioral inhibition, effortful control, or constraint
  * Negative emotionality
  * Elevated novelty seeking
  * Pre-dispose some children but not specific to the disorder

* **Environmental**
  * Very low birth weight (less than 1,500 grams): two-to three-fold risk
  * Smoking during pregnancy: association with ADHD, common genetic risk
  * History of child abuse, neglect, multiple foster placements, neurotoxin exposure, infections, or alcohol exposure in utero
  * Exposure to environmental toxicants may be associated with subsequent ADHD but not causal

* **Genetic and Physiological**
  * Elevated in first-degree biological relatives of individuals with ADHD
  * Substantial heritability
  * No specific genes necessary or sufficient causal factors
  * Visual, hearing impairments, metabolic abnormalities, sleep disorders, nutritional deficiencies, and epilepsy may influence symptoms

* **Course Modifiers**
  * Family interaction patterns unlikely to cause ADHD but may influence its course or contribute to secondary development of conduct problems
  * Cultural differences in diagnostic practices and attitudes towards child behaviors

* **Clinical Identification Rates**: lower for African American and Latino populations compared to Caucasian populations
* **Gender-Related Diagnostic Differences**
  * More frequent in males than females, with a ratio of approximately 2:1 in children and 1.6:1 in adults
  * Females present primarily with inattentive features

**Functional Consequences of ADHD**
* **Academic Performance**: reduced school performance and academic attainment
* **Social Functioning**: social rejection, interpersonal conflict, peer disruption
* **Occupational Performance**: poorer occupational performance, attendance, and higher probability of unemployment
* **Behavioral Problems**: conduct disorder in adolescence, antisocial personality disorder in adulthood
* **Health Risks**: increased likelihood of substance use disorders, traffic accidents, violations, obesity, and injuries
* **Family Relationships**: discord and negative interactions
* **Peer Relationships**: rejection, neglect, or teasing
* **Intellectual Abilities**: reduced intellectual scores, variability in academic performance.

###### Differential Diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)

**Differential Diagnosis for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**

**Oppositional Defiant Disorder vs. ADHD:**
- Individuals with Oppositional Defiant Disorder may resist work or school tasks due to negativity, hostility, and defiance.
- Symptoms differentiated from ADHD by aversion to mentally demanding tasks and forgetting instructions.
- Some individuals with ADHD may develop secondary oppositional attitudes towards such tasks but do not have the full symptom cluster of Oppositional Defiant Disorder.

**Intermittent Explosive Disorder vs. ADHD:**
- High levels of impulsive behavior shared between Intermittent Explosive Disorder and ADHD.
- Individuals with Intermittent Explosive Disorder show serious aggression towards others, which is not characteristic of ADHD.
- In addition, Intermittent Explosive Disorder is rare in childhood compared to ADHD.

**Other Neurodevelopmental Disorders:**
- Increased motor activity in ADHD must be distinguished from repetitive motor behavior in Stereotypic Movement Disorder or some cases of Autism Spectrum Disorder.
- Fidgetiness and restlessness in ADHD are generalized, unlike the fixed and repetitive movements in Stereotypic Movement Disorder.
- Tics in Tourette's Disorder may be mistaken for fidgetiness but require prolonged observation to differentiate from ADHD symptoms.

**Specific Learning Disorder vs. ADHD:**
- Children with Specific Learning Disorder may appear inattentive due to frustration, lack of interest, or limited ability.
- Inattention in Specific Learning Disorder is not impairing outside academic work compared to ADHD's impact on various aspects of life.

**Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder) vs. ADHD:**
- Symptoms of ADHD may be more evident in intellectual settings for individuals with Intellectual Disability.
- Diagnosis requires excessive inattention or hyperactivity beyond mental age.

**Autism Spectrum Disorder vs. ADHD:**
- Both conditions exhibit inattention, social dysfunction, and difficult behavior.
- Differentiated by social dysfunction and peer rejection in Autism Spectrum Disorder versus impulsivity in ADHD.
- Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder may display tantrums due to an inability to tolerate change, while those with ADHD have impulsive behavior.

**Reactive Attachment Disorder vs. ADHD:**
- Social disinhibition and lack of enduring relationships in Reactive Attachment Disorder.
- No evidence of full ADHD symptom cluster or other features like self-injury, extreme ambivalence, or fear of abandonment.

**Anxiety Disorders vs. ADHD:**
- Both conditions exhibit inattention but for different reasons: anxiety disorders have worry and rumination, while ADHD results from external stimuli attractions or preoccupation with enjoyable activities.
- Restlessness may occur in anxiety disorders but is not associated with elevated mood or grandiosity in ADHD.

**Depressive Disorders vs. ADHD:**
- Inattention in Mood Disorders becomes prominent during a depressive episode, unlike the consistent symptoms of ADHD.

**Bipolar Disorder vs. ADHD:**
- Individuals with Bipolar Disorder may exhibit increased activity, poor concentration, and impulsivity but only episodically.
- Clear evidence of ADHD before substance misuse or significant mood changes is essential for differential diagnosis.

**Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder vs. ADHD:**
- Pervasive irritability and intolerance of frustration in Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder but without impulsiveness and disorganized attention.
- Most children and adolescents with the disorder have symptoms that meet criteria for both conditions, requiring careful observation for distinction.

**Substance Use Disorders vs. ADHD:**
- Differentiating ADHD from substance use disorders may be problematic if onset occurs after substance misuse or frequent use.
- Clear evidence of ADHD before substance misuse or a detailed history is essential for differential diagnosis.

**Personality Disorders vs. ADHD:**
- Difficult to distinguish ADHD from borderline, narcissistic, and other personality disorders due to shared features like disorganization, social intrusiveness, emotional dysregulation, and cognitive dysregulation.
- No fear of abandonment, self-injury, extreme ambivalence or other specific features of Personality Disorders in ADHD.

**Psychotic Disorders vs. ADHD:**
- No diagnosis of ADHD if symptoms occur exclusively during psychotic disorder episodes.

**Medication-Induced Symptoms vs. ADHD:**
- Symptoms attributable to medication use diagnosed as Other Specified or Unspecified Other (or Known) Substance-Related Disorders instead of ADHD.

**Neurocognitive Disorders vs. ADHD:**
- Early major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) and mild neurocognitive disorder not associated with ADHD but may present similar clinical features due to late onset.

**Comorbidities:**
- Comorbid disorders are frequent in individuals with ADHD symptoms, including:
  - Oppositional Defiant Disorder
  - Conduct Disorder
  - Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder
  - Specific Learning Disorder
  - Anxiety Disorders
  - Major Depressive Disorder
  - Intermittent Explosive Disorder
  - Substance Use Disorders
  - Antisocial and Other Personality Disorders
  - Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
  - Tic Disorders
  - Autism Spectrum Disorder

##### Other Specified Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (314.01) 
- Used for presentations with ADHD symptoms causing distress or impairment without meeting full criteria
- Includes a specific reason why it doesn't meet ADHD or neurodevelopmental disorder criteria, e.g., "with insufficient inattention symptoms"

##### Unspecified ADHD (314.01)
- Used for presentations with ADHD symptoms causing distress or impairment without meeting full criteria
- No specific reason given for not meeting ADHD or neurodevelopmental disorder criteria, includes cases with insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

#### Specific Learning Disorder
##### Specific Learning Disorder (SLD)

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- Difficulties learning and using academic skills, as indicated by:
  1. Inaccurate or slow word reading
  2. Difficulty understanding the meaning of what is read
  3. Difficulties with spelling
  4. Difficulties with written expression
  5. Difficulties mastering number sense, facts, or calculation
  6. Difficulties with mathematical reasoning
- These symptoms have persisted for at least 6 months, despite interventions
- The affected academic skills are substantially and quantifiably below those expected for the individual's chronological age
- Cause significant interference with academic or occupational performance, or with activities of daily living
- For individuals age 17 years and older, a documented history of impairing learning difficulties may be substituted for standardized assessment
- The learning difficulties begin during school-age years but may not become fully manifest until the demands for those affected academic skills exceed the individual's limited capacities
- Not better accounted for by intellectual disabilities, uncorrected visual or auditory acuity, other mental or neurological disorders, psychosocial adversity, lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction, or inadequate educational instruction

**Coding Notes**:
- Specify all impaired academic domains and subskills (e.g., 315.00 for reading)
- When more than one domain is impaired, each one should be coded individually according to the above specifiers
- Record current severity: Mild, Moderate, or Severe

###### Diagnostic Criteria for Specific Learning Disorder

**Diagnostic Features of Specific Learning Disorder (SLD)**

**Background:**
- Neurodevelopmental disorder with a biological origin affecting cognitive abilities
- Persistent difficulties learning key academic skills during formal schooling years

**Criteria A1-A6:**
- Difficulties in reading, writing, arithmetic, and understanding language
  - Reading: single words, fluency, comprehension
  - Writing: expression, spelling
  - Arithmetic: calculation, reasoning
- These difficulties are not due to a lack of opportunities or inadequate instruction
- Learning difficulties impede progress in other academic subjects

**Criterion B:**
- Performance in affected academic skills is significantly below average for age
- Evidence from academic history, school reports, and tests
- Low achievement scores on standardized assessments (at least 1.5 SD below population mean)

**Criterion C:**
- Learning difficulties apparent early in school years, but may not manifest fully until later

**Criteria D:**
- Not attributable to intellectual disabilities, global developmental delay, hearing or vision disorders, neurological or motor disorders
- Affects individuals with normal levels of intellectual functioning (IQ > 70)

**Comprehensive Assessment:**
- Diagnosis based on synthesis of medical, developmental, educational, family history, impact on academic/occupational functioning, and previous assessments
- No single data source is sufficient for diagnosis
- Reassessment rare unless indicated by changes in learning difficulties or requested for specific purposes.

**Associated Features:**
- Delays in attention, language, or motor skills in early years (not invariably)
- Uneven profile of abilities: above average in some areas but poor reading and writing
- Poor performance on psychological tests of cognitive processing
- Increased risk for suicidal ideation and attempts in children, adolescents, and adults.

**Additional Notes:**
- No known biological markers, cognitive testing, neuroimaging, or genetic testing useful for diagnosis at this time.

###### Manifestations and Symptoms
**Prevalence of Specific Learning Disorder:**
- Prevalence: 5%-15% among school-age children, 4% in adults
- Onset: During elementary school years, but precursors may occur earlier
- Course: Lifelong with variable clinical expression and interacting factors
- Persistent symptoms: Problems with reading fluency and comprehensation, spelling, written expression, numeracy skills

**Manifestations:**
- Preschool age: Lack of interest in language games, trouble learning nursery rhymes, mispronunciation, difficulty recognizing letters or numbers
- Kindergarten age: Trouble breaking down words into syllables, recognizing phonemes, connecting letters with sounds
- Elementary school age: Marked difficulty learning letter-sound correspondence, slow and inaccurate reading aloud, trouble understanding magnitude of numbers
- Middle grades: Mispronunciation, confusion between similar sounding words, trouble remembering dates or names, poor comprehension
- Adolescents and adults: Slow and effortful reading, problems with inferences from written text, avoidance of activities requiring academic skills.

**Additional Manifestations:**
- Circumscribed learning difficulties: Inability to master basic sense of number, lack of proficiency in word identification or spelling
- Anxiety disorders: Common across the lifespan, sometimes accompanied by severe anxiety or panic attacks.

**Onset and Recognition:**
- Onset: Elementary school years, but precursors may occur earlier
- Precursors: Language delays or deficits, difficulties in rhyming or counting, fine motor skills for writing
- Recognition: Reluctance to engage in learning, oppositional behavior.

**Course:**
- Lifelong with variable clinical expression depending on environmental factors, learning abilities, comorbidity, and support systems/intervention.

###### Risk Factors and Differential Diagnosis
**Specific Learning Disorder (SLD)**

**Risk Factors:**
- **Environmental**: premature birth or very low birth weight, prenatal exposure to nicotine
- **Genetic and psychological**: aggregates in families, particularly for reading, math, spelling; high heritability (up to 80%); covariation between different manifestations of learning difficulties
- **Comorbidities**: ADHD predicts worse mental health outcomes; markers like inattention and speech/language delays may indicate later SLD in reading or mathematics

**Culture-Related Diagnosis:**
- Occurs across cultures but can vary in manifestation based on symbol systems and educational practices
- Assessment should consider language proficiency and cultural context for English language learners (ELLs)
- Risk factors: family history of SLD or language delay, learning difficulties in English, failure to catch up with peers

**Functional Consequences:**
- Lower academic attainment, higher dropout rates, lower income levels, increased psychological distress and mental health issues, unemployment/underemployment
- School dropout and depressive symptoms increase risk for poor mental health outcomes; social/emotional support predicts better outcomes

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Distinguished from normal variations in academic achievement due to external factors
- Intellectual disability: cannot be diagnosed if IQ score is below 70 and learning difficulties are in excess of those associated with the intellectual disability
- Neurological disorders, sensory impairments: distinguished by abnormal neurological examination findings
- Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): problems may not necessarily reflect specific difficulties in learning academic skills; co-occurrence is more frequent than chance
- Psychotic disorders: decline from a former state

**Comorbidities:**
- Commonly co-occurs with neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD and communication disorders
- Doesn't exclude the diagnosis of specific learning disorder but may make testing and differential diagnosis more difficult. Clinical judgment is required to attribute impairments to learning difficulties. If another diagnosis could account for key academic skill difficulties, SLD should not be diagnosed.

#### Motor Disorders
##### Developmental Coordination Disorder (315.4)

**Criteria A**:
- Acquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills significantly below expected level for age and opportunities
- Manifested as clumsiness, slowness, inaccuracy in motor tasks (e.g., catching objects, using cutlery, handwriting)

**Criteria B**:
- Motor skills deficit interferes with activities of daily living, academic/school productivity, leisure, and play
- Examples: self-care, eating meals, engaging in physical games, using tools at school, participating in team activities
- Handwriting impairment can affect legibility and speed, affecting academic achievement

**Criteria C**:
- Onset of symptoms in early developmental period (typically not diagnosed before age 5)
- Distinguished from: visual impairments, neurological conditions (e.g., cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy)

**Diagnostic Approach**:
- History, physical examination, school/workplace report, individual assessment using standardized tests
- Variation in motor skill acquisition with age
- Diagnosis made if impairment significantly interferes with daily activities
- Exclude other causes (visual function examination, neurological exam)

**Additional Information**:
- No subtypes, but individuals may be predominantly gross or fine motor impaired
- Other terms: childhood dyspraxia, specific developmental disorder of motor function, clumsy child syndrome.

###### Associated Features

**Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD)**

**Prevalence**:
- Affects 5-6% of children ages 5-11 years
- More common in males than females, with a ratio between 2:1 and 7:1

**Course and Prognosis**:
- Variable but stable at least to 1 year follow-up
- Problems with coordinated movements continue through adolescence in 50%-70% of children
- Onset in early childhood, with delayed motor milestones or first recognized when attempting tasks like eating or playing ball games
- In middle childhood: difficulties with puzzles, ball play, and handwriting
- In early adulthood: difficulty learning new complex/automatic motor skills like driving and using tools
- Impairment in ability to make rapid motoric adjustments as complexity increases

**Risk Factors**:
- Pre-natal alcohol exposure and preterm/low-birth-weight infants
- Underlying neurodevelopmental processes, particularly visual-motor skills and spatial mentalizing
- Cerebellar dysfunction proposed but neural basis unclear
- Co-occurrence with ADHD, specific learning disabilities, autism spectrum disorder may affect presentation, course, and outcome
- Environmental factors: culture, race, socioeconomic status

**Functional Consequences**:
- Impaired functional performance in activities of daily living (Criterion B)
- Increased impairment with co-occurring conditions
- Reduced participation in team play and sports
- Poor self-esteem and sense of worth
- Emotional or behavior problems
- Impaired academic achievement
- Poor physical fitness
- Reduced physical activity and obesity

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Medical conditions: visual function impairment, neurological disorders (e.g., cerebral palsy, neuromuscular disorders)
- Intellectual disability: if motor difficulties exceed what can be accounted for, DCD can be diagnosed
- Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): careful observation across contexts required to distinguish lack of competence from distractibility and impulsiveness
- Autism spectrum disorder: individuals may be uninterested in complex coordination tasks, affecting test performance but not core motor competence
- Joint hypermobility syndrome: individuals with hyperextensible joints may present symptoms similar to DCD

**Comorbidities**:
- Speech and language disorders
- Specific learning disorders (reading and writing)
- ADHD (most frequent coexisting condition, with about 50% co-occurrence)
- Autism spectrum disorder
- Disruptive and emotional behavior problems
- Joint hypermobility syndrome

##### Stereotypic Movement Disorder (307.3)

**Stereotypic Movement Disorder (F98.4)**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **A. Repetitive, seemingly driven, and apparently purposeless motor behavior:** hand shaking or waving, body rocking, head banging, self-biting, hitting own body
- **B. Interferes with social, academic, or other activities; may result in self-injury:** onset in early developmental period
- **C. Not attributable to physiological effects of a substance or neurological condition, and not better explained by another neurodevelopmental or mental disorder**

**Specifiers**:
- With self-injurious behavior (or behavior that would result in injury)
  - Mild: Symptoms easily suppressed by sensory stimulus or distraction
  - Moderate: Symptoms require explicit protective measures and behavioral modification
  - Severe: Continuous monitoring and protective measures required to prevent serious injury
- Associated with a known medical or genetic condition, neurological disorder, or environmental factor (e.g., Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, intellectual disability, intrauterine alcohol exposure)

**Coding Note**:
- Use additional code to identify the associated medical or genetic condition, neurodevelopmental disorder

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Repetitive, seemingly driven, and apparently purposeless motor behavior (Criterion A)
  - Often rhythmical movements of head, hands, or body without obvious adaptive function
  - Movements may not respond to efforts to stop them
- Self-injurious behaviors range in severity from mild to severe
  - Frequency varies from many occurrences per day to several weeks between episodes
- Movements vary in context (e.g., when engaged in other activities, excited, stressed, fatigued, or bored)
- Criterion A movements are "apparently" purposeless, but may serve functions like reducing anxiety
- Criterion B: Interferes with social, academic, or other activities; may result in self-injury or injury prevention measures
- Onset is in the early developmental period (Criterion C)
- Not attributable to physiological effects of a substance or neurological condition and not better explained by another neurodevelopmental or mental disorder (Criterion D)

###### Stereotypic Movements and Self-Injury in Intellectual Disability

**Prevalence of Stereotypic Movements:**
- Common in young typically developing children: simple movements (e.g., rocking)
- Complex stereotypies less common, affecting approximately 3%-4% of individuals with intellectual disability
- Higher risk for those with severe intellectual disability
- Between 10% and 15% of individuals living in residential facilities may exhibit stereotypic movement disorder with self-injury
- Onset often before age three, simple movements common in infancy

**Risk Factors:**
- Environmental: social isolation, environmental stress, fear can trigger stereotypic behavior
- Genetic and physiological: lower cognitive functioning linked to greater risk for stereotypies, higher risk in moderate-to-severe intellectual disability
- Neurogenetic syndromes (e.g., Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Rett syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome) may result in self-injury from hand-to-mouth stereotypies
- Painful medical conditions can also contribute to stereotypic behaviors

**Diagnostic Issues:**
- Occurs in all races and cultures
- Delayed diagnosis possible due to cultural attitudes towards unusual behaviors.

###### Differentiating Stereotypic Movements in Childhood: Diagnosis and Comorbidities

**Stereotypic Movement Disorder:**

**Normal Development vs Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):**
- Simple stereotypies common in infancy and early childhood
- Complex stereotypies less frequent, can be suppressed by distraction or sensory stimulation
- Typically does not affect daily routine or cause distress

**vs ASD:**
- Stereotypic movements may indicate ASD presentation
- Deficits of social communication and reciprocity absent in stereotypic movement disorder
- Diagnosis only when self-injury or severe enough to become treatment focus

**Tic Disorders:**
- Earlier age onset (before 3 years) than tics
- Consistent, fixed patterns compared to variable presentation of tics
- Stereotypies involve whole body while tics primarily affect eyes, face, head, shoulders
- More fixed, rhythmic, prolonged than brief and rapid tics
- Both reduced by distraction

**Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders (OCD):**
- Distinguished from OCD by absence of obsessions
- Repetitive behaviors seemingly driven but apparently purposeless in stereotypic movement disorder
- Body-focused repetitive behaviors like trichotillomania or excoriation disorder not patterned or rhythmical, onset typically around puberty or later

**Neurological Conditions:**
- Exclude habits, mannerisms, paroxysmal dyskinesias, and benign hereditary chorea
- Perform neurological history and examination to assess features suggestive of other disorders (myoclonus, dystonia, tics, etc.)
- Distinguish involuntary movements associated with conditions by signs and symptoms (repetitive movements in tardive dyskinesia not self-injurious)

**Comorbidity:**
- May occur as primary diagnosis or secondary to another medical condition
- Common manifestation of neurogenetic disorders like Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Rett syndrome, fragile X syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Smith-Magenis syndrome
- When co-occurring with another medical condition, both should be coded.

#### Tic Disorders
**Tic Disorders**

**Types of Tic Disorders:**
- **Tourette's Disorder (307.23, F95.2)**
  * Both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics have been present at some time during the illness
  * The tics may wax and wane in frequency but have persisted for more than 1 year since first tic onset
  * Onset is before age 18 years
  * Not attributable to physiological effects of a substance or medical condition
- **Persistent (Chronic) Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder (307.22, F95.1)**
  * Single or multiple motor or vocal tics have been present during the illness
  * The tics may wax and wane in frequency but have persisted for more than 1 year since first tic onset
  * Onset is before age 18 years
  * Not attributable to physiological effects of a substance or medical condition
- **Provisional Tic Disorder**
  * Single or multiple motor and/or vocal tics
  * The tics have been present for less than 1 year since first tic onset
  * Onset is before age 18 years
  * Not attributable to physiological effects of a substance or medical condition
  * Criteria have never been met for Tourette's disorder or persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder
- **Other Specified and Unspecified Tic Disorders**
  * Diagnostic features vary based on specific type of tic disorder

**Tic Symptoms:**
- Sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movements or vocalizations
- Involuntary but can be voluntarily suppressed for varying lengths of time
- Simple tics: short duration (milliseconds), eye blinking, shoulder shrugging, etc.
- Complex tics: longer duration (seconds), combination of simple tics, purposeful or imitative movements, etc.

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
1. Presence of motor and/or vocal tics
2. Duration of symptoms (1 year for Tourette's, persistent, chronic; no duration specified for other types)
3. Age at onset (before age 18)
4. Absence of known cause (substance or medical condition)
5. Hierarchical diagnosis: once a higher-level diagnosis is made, lower-level diagnoses cannot be given
6. Tics wax and wane in severity; tic-free periods do not negate persistent symptoms.

**Prevalence**:
- Tics are common in childhood but transient in most cases
- Estimated prevalence of Tourette's disorder: 3-8 per 1,000 school-age children
- Males more commonly affected than females (2:1 to 4:1 ratio)
- Frequency of identified cases lower among African Americans and Hispanic Americans

**Development and Course**:
- Onset typically between ages 4 and 6
- Peak severity between 10 and 12 years, with decline in adolescence
- Many adults experience diminished symptoms
- Small percentage may have persistently severe or worsening symptoms
- Tic symptoms manifest similarly across age groups and lifespan
- Tics wax and wane in severity, change in muscle groups, vocalizations

**Vulnerability for Co-occurring Conditions**:
- Prepubertal children: more likely to have ADHD, OCD, separation anxiety disorder
- Teenagers/adults: more likely to have major depressive disorder, substance use disorder, bipolar disorder

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**:
- **Temperament**: Tics worsened by anxiety, excitement, exhaustion; better during calm activities
- **Environmental**: Observing a gesture/sound in another person may result in similar tic
- **Genetic and Physiological**: Genetic and environmental factors influence symptom expression/severity
- **Obstetric Complications**, older paternal age, lower birth weight, maternal smoking during pregnancy associated with worse severity

**Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues**:
- Tic disorders do not vary clinically by race, ethnicity, or culture
- Culture may impact how tics are perceived and managed in family/community

**Gender Differences**:
- Males more commonly affected than females
- No gender differences in types of tics, age onset, course
- Women with persistent tic disorders may be more likely to experience anxiety and depression

**Functional Consequences**:
- Many individuals experience no distress or impairment
- Severe symptoms can disrupt daily activities, cause social isolation, peer victimization, lower quality of life
- Rare complications: physical/orthopedic injuries, eye injury

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- **Motor stereotypies**: involuntary rhythmic, repetitive movements; earlier age onset, constant form/location, lack of premonitory urge
- **Chorea**: rapid, random movements; typically bilateral, worsens with voluntary movement
- **Dystonia**: sustained contracture of agonist and antagonist muscles, distorted posture or movement
- **Substance-induced/paroxysmal dyskinesias**, myoclonus: distinguish by rapidity, lack of suppression, absence of premonitory urge
- **Obsessive-compulsive behaviors**: cognitive drive, need to perform in particular fashion

**Comorbidities of Tic Disorders:**
- ADHD: disrupted behavior, social immaturity, learning difficulties
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): aggressive symmetry and order symptoms, poor response to SSRIs
- Other movement disorders
- Depressive, bipolar, substance use disorders

### Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders

**Psychotic Disorders (Schizophrenia Spectrum)**

**Characteristics:**
- Abnormalities in one or more of: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, grossly disorganized behavior, negative symptoms
- Diagnosis based on symptoms present in five domains

**Delusions:**
- Fixed beliefs not changed by evidence
- Themes include persecutory, referential, somatic, religious, grandiose, nihilistic
- Bizarre if implausible and not understandable to peers
- Example: belief an external force removed organs or thought withdrawal

**Hallucinations:**
- Perception without external stimulus
- Vivid and clear, full impact of normal perception
- Difficult to distinguish from strongly held ideas
- Auditory hallucinations most common in schizophrenia
- Hallucinations part of religious experience in some cultural contexts
- Distinction between delusion and strongly held idea based on degree of conviction

**Disorganized Thinking (Speech):**
- Inferred from individual's speech
- Topic switching, oblique answers, unrelated responses
- Severity must substantially impair communication

**Grossly Disorganized or Abnormal Motor Behavior:**
- Manifestations of a variety of problems
- Childlike silliness to agitation and lack of responses
- Catatonic behavior: resistance, rigid postures, mutism, stupor, purposeless activity
- Negativism, negativity accounts for substantial morbidity in schizophrenia.

**Negative Symptoms:**
- Diminished emotional expression and avolation
- Diminished emotional expression includes reduced facial expressions, eye contact, prosody, hand movements
- Avolition: decrease in motivated self-initiated purposeful activities
- Other negative symptoms: alogia, anhedonia, asociality.

###### Disorders in This Chapter

**Psychopathology Gradient**
- Clinicians should first consider conditions without full criteria for psychotic disorder or limited to one domain of psychopathology
- Time-limited conditions
- Diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder requires excluding another condition causing psychosis

**Conditions within the Chapter:**
- **Schizotypal personality disorder**: noted as part of the schizophrenia spectrum, full description in "Personality Disorders" chapter
- **Delusional disorder**: characterized by at least 1 month of delusions without other psychotic symptoms
- **Catatonia**: described later in chapter and discussed further
- **Brief psychotic disorder**: lasts more than 1 day and remits by 1 month
- **Schizophreniform disorder**: symptomatic presentation equivalent to schizophrenia, but less than 6 months and no decline in functioning
- **Schizophrenia**: requires at least 6 months with active phase symptoms
- **Schizoaffective disorder**: mood episode with active-phase symptoms of schizophrenia for at least 2 weeks
- **Substance / medication-induced psychotic disorder**: psychotic symptoms a physiological consequence of a drug, medication, or toxin exposure
- **Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition**

**Catatonia**
- Can occur in several disorders (neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bipolar, depressive, and other mental disorders)
- Includes **catatonia associated with another mental disorder (catatonia specifier)**, **catatonic disorder due to another medical condition**, and **unspecified catatonia** diagnoses

**Other Specified and Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders:**
- For classifying psychotic presentations that do not meet criteria for specific disorders or where there is inadequate/contradictory information.

**Clinician-Rated Assessments of Symptoms and Related Clinical Phenomena in Psychosis:**
- **Psychotic disorders are heterogeneous, with varying symptom severity predicting important aspects like cognitive or neurobiological deficits.**
- Section III includes a framework for assessing severity to aid treatment planning, prognostic decision making, and research on pathophysiological mechanisms.
- Section III also contains dimensional assessments of primary symptoms: hallucinations, delusions (except substance/medication-induced), disorganized speech (except for certain disorders), abnormal psychomotor behavior, negative symptoms.
- Dimensional assessments of depression and mania to alert clinicians to mood pathology and guide treatment.
- A dimensional assessment of cognitive impairment is included as many individuals with psychotic disorders have cognitive domain deficits predicting functional status.
- Formal neuropsychological testing, when conducted, should be administered and scored by trained personnel.

#### Schizotypal (Personality) Disorder

**Schizotypal (Personality) Disorder**

**Symptoms and Severity**:
- Symptoms include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms
- Each symptom rated for current severity on a 5-point scale (0-4) to assess primary symptoms of psychosis

**Delusional Beliefs**:
- May not accept that others view their beliefs as irrational
- Can lead to irritable or dysphoric mood, anger, and violent behavior
- Individuals may engage in litigious or antagonistic behavior, resulting in legal difficulties

**Prevalence:**
- Estimated lifetime prevalence: around 0.2%
- Most frequent subtype: persecutory
- No major gender differences overall
- Higher in older individuals

**Development and Course:**
- Generally better global function than schizophrenia
- Diagnosis stable, but some progress to schizophrenia
- Significant familial relationship with schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder

**Functional Consequences:**
- Impairment more circumscribed than other psychotic disorders
- Substantial impairment possible, including poor occupational functioning and social isolation

**Differential Diagnosis:**
*Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD):*
  - If obsessions are completely believed, diagnosis is OCD with absent insight/delusional beliefs specifier

*Body dysmorphic disorder:*
  - If beliefs are completely believed, diagnosis is body dysmorphic disorder with absent insight/delusional beliefs specifier

*Delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder:*
  - Distinguished by chronological relationship between symptoms and onset/remission of delusional beliefs

*Schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder:*
  - Absence of other characteristic symptoms during active phase of schizophrenia

*Depressive disorders and schizoaffective disorder:*
  - Temporal relationship between mood disturbance and delusions important for diagnosis
- Delusional disorder can only be diagnosed if total duration of all mood episodes remains brief relative to the total duration of the delusional disturbance.

##### Brief Psychotic Disorder (298.8)

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **A.** Presence of one or more symptoms: Delusions, Hallucinations, Disorganized speech, Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior

  - With postpartum onset: During pregnancy or within 4 weeks postpartum
- **Coding note**: Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1) for catatonia associated with brief psychotic disorder

**Assessment and Diagnosis**:
- Emotional turmoil, overwhelming confusion, rapid shifts in affect
- Level of impairment may be severe, requiring supervision
- Increased risk of suicidal behavior during acute episode
- Prevalence: 9% of first-onset psychosis cases in the US; more common in females than males
- Onset can occur at any age but most commonly mid-30s
- Full remission and return to premorbid level within 1 month required for diagnosis

**Temperamental and Cultural Considerations**:
- Personality disorders or traits (schizotypal, borderline) may increase risk
- Distinguish symptoms from culturally sanctioned responses
- Cultural background affects perception of beliefs as delusional

**Functional Consequences**:
- High rates of relapse but excellent social functioning and symptomatology outcome for most individuals.

**Differential Diagnosis**
- **Medical Conditions**:
  - **Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition or delirium**: Evidence from history, physical exam, lab tests of a specific medical condition causing psychotic symptoms (e.g., Cushing's syndrome, brain tumor)
- **Substance-related disorders**:
  - **Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder**, **substance-induced delirium**, and **substance intoxication**: Psychotic symptoms related to substance use (e.g., drugs of abuse, medications, toxins)
  - Urine drug screens or blood alcohol levels may help determine etiology
  - Careful history of substance use with attention to temporal relationships and nature of substances used
- **Depressive and bipolar disorders**:
  - Cannot diagnose brief psychotic disorder if psychotic symptoms are exclusive to a mood episode (major depressive, manic, mixed)
  - If psychotic symptoms persist for 1 month or longer: Schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, depressive disorder with psychotic features, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, or other specified/unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders
- Difficult differential diagnosis between brief psychotic disorder and schizophreniform disorder for recurring psychotic symptoms that remit in response to medication treatment
- **Malingering and factitious disorders**: Appearance of brief psychotic disorder but with intentional production of symptoms
- **Personality Disorders**: Psychosocial stressors may precipitate transient psychotic symptoms, not warranting separate diagnosis if symptoms persist for at least 1 day.

- Earlier age at onset is a predictor of worse prognosis (except for males)
- Impaired cognition common and present during development and precedes emergence of psychosis
- Cognitive impairments persist when other symptoms are in remission
- Course favorable in about 20%, some individuals recover completely
- Most require daily living supports, many remain chronically ill with exacerbations and remissions
- Psychotic symptoms diminish over life course, possibly associated with age-related declines in dopamine activity
- Negative symptoms more closely related to prognosis than positive symptoms, tend to be most persistent

**Childhood Schizophrenia**
- Diagnosis more difficult due to less elaborate delusions and hallucinations
- Disorganized speech and behavior common in other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder)
- Childhood-onset cases resemble poor-outcome adult cases, gradual onset, prominent negative symptoms
- Children with schizophrenia more likely to have emotional-behavioral disturbances, intellectual/language alterations, subtle motor delays

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**

**Environmental:**
- Season of birth linked to incidence (late winter/early spring or summer for deficit form)
- Higher incidence in urban environments and some minority ethnic groups

**Genetic and Physiological:**
- Strong genetic contribution, but most diagnosed individuals have no family history
- Liability conferred by spectrum of risk alleles, common and rare, each contributing small fraction to population variance
- Pregnancy and birth complications (hypoxia, greater paternal age) associated with higher risk for developing fetus
- Other prenatal/perinatal adversities linked to schizophrenia, but vast majority of offspring do not develop it

**Cultural Factors:**
- Consider cultural factors when assessing individuals and their backgrounds
- Delusions may be normative in some cultures (e.g., witchcraft)
- Assessment challenges due to linguistic barriers or differences in emotional expression, eye contact, body language

**Gender-Related Factors:**
- Lower general incidence in females, later age at onset, more affect-laden symptoms
- Females have fewer negative symptoms and disorganization but higher suicide risk over lifetime.

###### Differential Diagnosis: Schizophrenia vs. Other Disorders

**Major Depressive or Bipolar Disorder with Psychotic Features:**
- Temporal relationship between mood disturbance and psychosis determines diagnosis
  - If delusions/hallucinations occur exclusively during a major depressive or manic episode: depression or bipolar disorder with psychotic features

**Schizoaffective Disorder:**
- Major depressive or manic episode occurs concurrently with active-phase symptoms
- Mood symptoms present for majority of total duration of active periods

**Schizophreniform Disorder and Brief Psychotic Disorder:**
- Shorter duration than schizophrenia (less than 6 months)
- Symptoms in schizophreniform disorder: present less than 6 months
- Symptoms in brief psychotic disorder: at least 1 day but less than 1 month

**Delusional Disorder:**
- Absence of other symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia (e.g., delusions, hallucinations)

**Schizotypal Personality Disorder:**
- Subthreshold symptoms associated with persistent personality features

**Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Body Dysmorphic Disorder:**
- Poor or absent insight
- Prominent obsessions, compulsions, preoccupations (appearance, body odor)

**Posttraumatic Stress Disorder:**
- Flashbacks have hallucinatory quality
- Trauma event and symptom features required for diagnosis

**Autism Spectrum Disorder or Communication Disorders:**
- Symptoms resembling a psychotic episode but distinguished by social interaction deficits, repetitive behaviors, cognitive/communication deficits

**Other Mental Disorders Associated with Psychotic Episode:**
- Diagnosis of schizophrenia requires persistent and non-attributable-to-substance psychotic episode
- Delirium or neurocognitive disorder symptoms have temporal relationship to cognitive changes
- Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder distinguished by chronological use relationship

**Comorbidity:**
- High rates of comorbidity with substance disorders, especially tobacco use and smoking
- Increasing recognition of anxiety disorder comorbidity in schizophrenia
- Schizotypal or paranoid personality disorder may precede onset of schizophrenia
- Reduced life expectancy due to associated medical conditions (weight gain, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular and pulmonary disease)
- Poor engagement in health maintenance behaviors increases risk for chronic disease but other factors play a role.

##### Schizoaffective Disorder

**Schizoaffective Disorder**

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- Uninterrupted period of illness during which there is a major mood episode (major depressive or manic) concurrent with Criterion A of schizophrenia.
- Delusions or hallucinations for 2 or more weeks in the absence of a major mood episode during the lifetime duration of the illness.
- Symptoms meeting criteria for a major mood episode are present for the majority of the total duration of the active and residual portions of the illness.
- The disturbance is not attributable to the effects of a substance or another medical condition.

**Subtypes:**
1. **Bipolar Type**: A manic episode is part of the presentation, with major depressive episodes also occurring.
2. **Depressive Type**: Only major depressive episodes are present in the presentation.
3. **Catatonia**: If catatonic symptoms (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with another mental disorder) are present, use the additional code 293.89 (F06.1) to indicate the presence of comorbid catatonia.

**Coding Notes:**
- Use appropriate course specifiers after a minimum 1-year duration and if they do not contradict diagnostic course criteria.
1. **First Episode, Currently in Acute Episode**: First manifestation of the disorder meeting defining symptom and time criteria. An acute episode is a time period during which symptom criteria are fulfilled.
2. **First Episode, Currently in Partial Remission**: Partial remission is a time period after a previous episode during which improvement is maintained and diagnostic criteria are only partially fulfilled.
3. **First Episode, Currently in Full Remission**: Full remission is a period after a previous episode with no disorder-specific symptoms present.
4. **Multiple Episodes, Currently in Acute Episode**: Multiple episodes determined after a minimum of two episodes (first episode, remission, and one relapse).
5. **Multiple Episodes, Currently in Partial Remission**: Multiple episodes during which partial remission is maintained after a minimum of two episodes.
6. **Continuous**: Symptoms fulfilling diagnostic symptom criteria of the disorder are present for the majority of the illness course.
7. **Unspecified**: Specify current severity using a quantitative assessment of primary symptoms of psychosis on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4 (most severe in the last 7 days).

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Based on assessment of an uninterrupted period of illness during which the individual continues to display active or residual symptoms of psychotic illness.
- Usually made during the period of psychotic illness but not necessarily at that time.
- Meets criteria for schizophrenia (Criterion A) with a major mood episode (major depressive or manic).
- Distinguishes from depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features by the presence of delusions or hallucinations for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a major mood episode during the lifetime duration of the illness.
- Symptoms not attributable to substance use or other medical conditions (Criterion D).

**Associated Features:**
- Impaired occupational functioning, restricted social contact, and difficulties with self-care are common but not defining criteria.
- Anosognosia (poor insight) is also present but may be less severe and pervasive than in schizophrenia.
- Individuals at increased risk for later developing episodes of major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder if mood symptoms continue following remission of symptoms meeting Criterion A for schizophrenia.
- No specific tests or biological measures can assist in making the diagnosis, and it is unclear whether schizoaffective disorder differs from schizophrenia with regard to associative features such as structural or functional brain abnormalities, cognitive deficits, or genetic risk factors.

###### Prevalence, Diagnosis, and Prognosis

**Schizoaffective Disorder**

**Prevalence**: Schizoaffective disorder is about one-third as common as schizophrenia. Lifetime prevalence of schizoaffective disorder is estimated to be 0.3%.

**Incidence**: Higher incidence in females than males, mainly due to increased occurrence of depressive type among females.

**Age at Onset**: Typical age of onset is early adulthood, from adolescence to late life. Many individuals diagnosed with another psychotic illness may later receive a schizoaffective disorder diagnosis.

**Prognosis**: Prognosis somewhat better than schizophrenia but worse than mood disorders. Some individuals may convert from schizoaffective disorder to another disorder as mood symptoms become less prominent.

**Temporal Patterns**: Variable expression of psychotic and mood symptoms across the lifespan. Co-occurrence of psychotic and mood symptoms is diagnostic.

**Risk Factors**: Genetic and physiological factors increase risk for schizoaffective disorder in individuals with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Cultural and socioeconomic factors must be considered during diagnosis.

**Suicide Risk**: Lifetime risk of suicide for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder is 5%. Higher risk for suicide with depressive symptoms. Suicide rates are higher in North American populations compared to other regions.

**Functional Consequences**: Schizoaffective disorder is associated with social and occupational dysfunction, but dysfunction is not a diagnostic criterion. Variability between individuals diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.

###### Differential Diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder: Considering Co-occurring Conditions

**Differential Diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder**

**Considerations in Differential Diagnosis:**
- **Psychiatric Conditions**: Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder or neurocognitive disorder, bipolar disorders with psychotic features, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, depressive or bipolar disorders with catatonic features, schizotypal, schizoid, or paranoid personality disorder, brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder, and other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.
- **Medical Conditions and Substance Use**: Exclude psychotic disorder due to another medical condition.

**Distinguishing Schizoaffective Disorder:**
- From Schizophrenia: Criterion C separates the two.
- From Depressive or Bipolar Disorders with Psychotic Features: Criterion B differentiates them based on the presence of prominent delusions and/or hallucinations for at least 2 weeks in absence of a major mood episode versus psychotic features primarily occurring during the mood episode(s).
- **Diagnosis Changes Over Time**: Appropriate diagnosis may change as relative proportion of mood to psychotic symptoms fluctuates.

**Comorbidities:**
- Increased risk for substance use disorders and anxiety disorders.
- Decreased life expectancy due to increased incidence of medical conditions.

##### Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder

**Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder+ Diagnostic Criteria**

A. **Presence of one or both of the following symptoms:**
    1. **Delusions**
    2. **Hallucinations**
B. **Evidence of the following:**
    1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.
    2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Criterion A.
    3. The disturbance is not better explained by an independent psychotic disorder.
    4. **The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.**
    5. **The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.**

**Coding note:**
- ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for specific substance/medication-induced psychotic disorders are indicated in the table below.
- The 4th position character depends on whether a comorbid substance use disorder is present:
  - **With mild or severe substance use disorder:** Use the "mild" or "moderate/severe" code, respectively, for the substance/medication and add "with [substance]-induced psychotic disorder".
  - **Without comorbid substance use disorder:** Use only the substance-induced psychotic disorder code.

**Specify onset during intoxication or withdrawal.**
- **With onset during intoxication:** If the criteria are met for intoxication with the substance and symptoms develop during intoxication.
- **With onset during withdrawal:** If the criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and symptoms develop during or shortly after withdrawal.

**Specify current severity:** Rate each symptom (delusions, hallucinations, abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4 (most severe in the last 7 days).

###### Diagnostic Features and Associated Substances

**Diagnostic Features**
- **Criterion A**: Prominent delusions and/or hallucinations
- **Criterion B**: Judged to be due to physical effects of a substance/medication

**Distinguishing from Primary Psychotic Disorder**
- Arises during or soon after exposure to medication or substance intoxication/withdrawal
- Can persist for weeks, while primary psychotic disorders may precede use or occur during sustained abstinence
- Symptoms continue as long as substance use continues
- Consider other causes of psychotic symptoms

**Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis**
- **Psychotic disorders can occur with**: 
  - alcohol
  - cannabis
  - hallucinogens
  - inhalants
  - sedatives/hypnotics/anxiolytics
  - stimulants
  - and other substances (intoxication or withdrawal)
- **Medications reported to evoke psychotic symptoms**: 
  - anesthetics/analgesics
  - anticholinergics
  - anticonvulsants
  - antihistamines
  - antihypertensives/cardiovascular meds
  - antimicrobial medications
  - antiparkinsonian meds
  - chemotherapeutic agents (e.g.
  - cyclosporine)
  - corticosteroids
  - gastrointestinal meds
  - muscle relaxants
  - nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory meds
  - over-the-counter meds (e.g.
  - phenylephrine
  - pseudoephedrine)
  - antidepressant medication
  - and disulfiram
- **Toxins reported to induce psychotic symptoms**: 
  - anticholinesterase
  - organophosphate insecticides
  - sarin and other nerve gases
  - carbon monoxide
  - carbon dioxide
  - and volatile substances (fuel or paint)

###### Prevaience

**Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder**

**Prevalence**:
- Unknown prevalence in general population
- 7% to 25% of individuals with first episode psychosis have substance/medication-induced disorder

**Initiation and Duration**:
- **Variation by Substance**:
  - Cocaine: Psychosis within minutes
  - Alcohol: Prolonged, heavy ingestion required for psychosis
  - Cannabis: Shortly after high-dose use, may remit within a day
- **Alcohol-Induced Disorder**: Hallucinations usually auditory in nature
- **Amphetamine/Cocaine**: Persecutory delusions, hallucinations of bugs or vermin, and extensive skin excoriations
- **Cannabis-Induced Disorder**: Shortly after high-dose use, involves persecutory delusions, marked anxiety, emotional lability, and depersonalization
- Some cases may persist even after removal of offending agent

**Diagnostic Markers**:
- **Relevant Blood Levels**: Can increase diagnostic certainty (e.g., alcohol level)

**Functional Consequences**:
- Severely disabling and usually observed in emergency rooms
- Disability is typically self-limited and resolves upon removal of offending agent

###### Diagnostic Considerations

**Substance intoxication or withdrawal:**
* Individuals experiencing altered perceptions due to substance use or withdrawal
* Reality testing remains intact: not substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, but diagnosed as substance intoxication or withdrawal (e.g., cocaine intoxication)
* Flashbacks of hallucinations after use: diagnosed as Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder
* If psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during a delirium, consider an associated feature of the delirium
* Delusions in context of neurocognitive disorder: diagnosed as major or mild neurocognitive disorder with behavioral disturbance

**Primary psychotic disorders:**
* Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder distinguished from primary psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder) by etiological relationship to a substance
* If causative agent is unclear, consider both diagnoses: Psychotic Disorder due to Another Medical Condition and Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder.

**Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition:**
* Onset of symptoms while receiving prescription treatment for a mental or medical condition
* Consider the possibility that physiological consequences of medical condition are causing psychotic symptoms rather than medication
* History provides primary basis for judgment; change in treatment may be needed to determine causative agent.

##### Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition

**Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **A.**: Prominent hallucinations or delusions
- **B.**: Evidence from history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is a direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition
- **C.**: The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder
- **D.**: The disturbance does not occur exclusively during delirium
- **E.**: The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning

**Specifying the Predominant Symptom**:
- Code based on predominant symptom: 293.81 (F06.2) with delusions, or 293.82 (F06.0) with hallucinations
- Include the name of the other medical condition in the mental disorder code (e.g., "psychotic disorder due to malignant lung neoplasm")
- Code and list the other medical condition separately before the psychotic disorder

**Severity Specifiers**:
- Rate the severity of the primary symptoms of psychosis on a 5-point scale
- This is not required to make the diagnosis

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Prominent delusions or hallucinations judged to be attributable to physiological effects of another medical condition
- Not better explained by another mental disorder
- Hallucinations may be in any sensory modality, with specific phenomena for certain etiological factors (e.g., olfactory hallucinations suggest temporal lobe epilepsy)
- Delusions have various themes, but associations with particular medical conditions are less specific than for hallucinations

**Determining Etiology**:
- Temporal association between onset/exacerbation of the medical condition and psychotic disturbance
- Presence of features atypical for a psychotic disorder (e.g., atypical age, presence of visual/olfactory hallucinations)
- Distinguishing from substance/medication-induced psychosis or other mental disorders

###### "Prevalence and Diagnosis of Psychosis Associated with Medical Conditions"

**Prevalence of Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**
- Difficult to estimate due to wide variety of underlying medical etiologies
- Lifetime prevalence estimated between 0.21% and 0.54%
- Older individuals (65+) have significantly greater prevalence (0.74%) compared to younger age groups

**Factors Affecting Prevalence**
- Certain medical conditions more commonly associated with psychosis: untreated endocrine and metabolic disorders, autoimmune diseases, temporal lobe epilepsy
- Higher prevalence in females for some older individuals but not all
- Psychosis can be a single event or recurring with underlying condition exacerbations

**Treatment and Course**
- Treating underlying medical condition often resolves psychosis but not always
- Long-term course possible for chronic conditions like multiple sclerosis, epilepsy
- Expression of disorder does not differ in phenomenology based on age at occurrence
- Increasing age increases risk due to medical burden and cumulative effects

**Risk Factors and Prognostic Modifiers**
- Diagnosis depends on individual clinical condition
- Variety of medical conditions can cause psychotic symptoms (neurological, endocrine, metabolic)
- Suicide risk not clearly delineated but increased in certain conditions like epilepsy and multiple sclerosis

**Functional Consequences**
- Severe functional disability varies by type of condition

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Distinguish from delirium, substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, other psychotic disorders (schizophrenia, depressive or bipolar disorders) based on specific causative mechanisms associated with medical condition.

#### Catatonia

**Catatonia**
- Can occur in various disorders: neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bipolar, depressive, and other medical conditions
- Not recognized as an independent class but categorized under catatonia associated with another mental disorder or catatonic disorder due to another medical condition

##### Catatonia Associated With Another Mental Disorder (Catatonia Specifier) (293.89)
- Dominant clinical picture: three or more of 12 symptoms
   - Stupor: no psychomotor activity
   - Catalepsy: passive posture against gravity
   - Waxy flexibility: slight resistance to positioning
   - Mutism: little verbal response (excluding aphasia)
   - Negativism: opposition or no response to instructions/stimuli
   - Posturing: spontaneous maintenance of a posture
   - Mannerism: odd, caricatured actions
   - Stereotypy: repetitive non-goal-directed movements
   - Agitation: not influenced by external stimuli
   - Grimacing
   - Echolalia: mimicking speech
   - Echopraxia: mimicking movements

**Diagnostic Features of Catatonia Associated With Another Mental Disorder**
- Occurs during the course of a neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bipolar, depressive, or other mental disorder
- Diagnosed in an inpatient setting
- May be used when catatonia symptoms are present and at least three of the 12 diagnostic features listed above
- Typically diagnosed more frequently in schizophrenia but can affect various disorders
- Before using this specifier, rule out other medical conditions such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome or medication side effects.

**Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**
- Dominant clinical picture: presence of catatonia attributed to another medical condition
- Evidence from history, physical examination, or laboratory findings supporting the attribution
- Not given if better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., manic episode) or occurs exclusively during delirium
- Causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning.

**Diagnostic Features of Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**
- Presence of catatonia attributed to another medical condition (neurological, metabolic)
- Evidence from history, physical examination, and laboratory findings supporting the attribution
- Not given if better explained by another mental disorder or occurs exclusively during delirium.

**Supporting Features for Diagnosis**
- Various medical conditions may cause catatonia (neurological: tumors, head trauma, cerebrovascular disease; metabolic: hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, diabetic ketoacidosis)
- Associated physical examination findings, laboratory findings, and patterns of prevalence and onset reflect etiological medical condition.

###### Catatonia Diagnosis and Coding Guidelines

**Differential Diagnosis of Catatonia:**

**Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**
- Not given if catatonia occurs exclusively during delirium or neuroleptic malignant syndrome
- Consider medication-induced movement disorders (e.g., abnormal positioning due to neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia) or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (catatonic features present with associated vital sign and laboratory abnormalities)
- If individual is on neuroleptics, consider catatonic symptoms as possible side effects

**Psychotic Disorders:**
- Catatonic symptoms may be present in brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder

**Neurodevelopmental Disorders:**
- Catatonia can also be found in some neurodevelopmental disorders

**Bipolar and Depressive Disorders:**
- Present in all bipolar disorders and some depressive disorders

**Other Mental Disorders:**
- May appear in various other mental health conditions

##### Unspecified Catatonia
- Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment but full criteria for catatonia are not met or insufficient information is available
- Code first: 781.99 (R29.818) other symptoms involving nervous and musculoskeletal systems, followed by 293.89 (F06.1) unspecified catatonia.

##### Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder

**Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder**
- Applies to presentations that:
  - Have symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders
  - Cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning
  - Do not meet full criteria for any specific disorder
- **Examples:**
  1. Persistent auditory hallucinations in the absence of other features
  2. Delusions with significant overlapping mood episodes (not brief)
  3. Attenuated psychosis syndrome: Psychotic-like symptoms below psychosis threshold, with insight relatively maintained
  4. **Deusional symptoms in partner** of individual who does not fully meet criteria for delusional disorder

##### Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder
(298.9)

**Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder**
- Applies to presentations:
  - Have symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders
  - Cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning
  - Do not meet full criteria for any specific disorder
- **Characteristics:**
  - Clinician chooses not to specify the reason the criteria are not met for a specific diagnosis
  - Includes presentations with insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis

### Bipolar and Related Disorders

**Bipolar and Related Disorders**
- Separated from depressive disorders in DSM-5
- Placed between schizophrenia spectrum/psychotic disorders and depressive disorders
- Diagnoses:
    - Bipolar I disorder
        * Modern understanding of classic manic-depressive disorder or affective psychosis
        * Criteria include at least one major manic episode without requiring lifetime experience of a major depressive episode
    - Bipolar II disorder
        * Lifetime experience of at least one major depression and at least one hypomanic episode
        * "Milder" than bipolar I, but impairment in work and social functioning is common due to time spent in depression
    - Cyclothymic disorder
        * At least 2 years (or 1 year for children) of hypomanic and depressive periods without fulfilling criteria for mania, hypomania, or major depression
- Other bipolar related diagnoses:
    - Substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder

###### Diagnostic Criteria and Features

**Criteria for Diagnosis**:
- At least one manic episode (Criteria A-D under "Manic Episode")
- Manic and major depressive episodes not better explained by other disorders

**Coding and Recording Procedures**:
- Diagnostic code based on type of current/most recent episode, severity, presence of psychotic features, and remission status
- Codes for current or most recent manic, hypomanic, depressed, and unspecified episodes
- Severity (Mild, Moderate, Severe), psychotic, and remission specifiers apply as needed
- Coding note: Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1) for with peripartum onset or seasonal pattern

**With Mixed Features**:
- Depressive symptoms may occur during manic episode lasting moments, hours, or days.

###### Bipolar Disorder: Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Diagnostic Challenges

**Prevalence**:
- 12-month prevalence estimate in continental U.S.: 0.6% for bipolar I disorder as defined in DSM-IV
- 12-month prevalence of bipolar I disorder across 11 countries: 0.0% to 0.6%
- Lifetime male-to-female prevalence ratio is approximately 1.1:1

**Development and Course**:
- Mean age at onset of first manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode: approximately 18 years for bipolar I disorder
- Special considerations needed to detect diagnosis in children
- Onset occurs throughout life cycle, including first onsets in the 60s or 70s
- More than 90% of individuals with a single manic episode go on to have recurrent mood episodes
- Approximately 60% of manic episodes occur immediately before a major depressive episode
- Individuals with bipolar I disorder who have multiple (4 or more) mood episodes within 1 year receive the specialifier "with rapid cycling"

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**:
- **Environmental**: More common in high-income than low-income countries (1.4 vs. 0.7%)
- **Genetic and Physiological**: Family history of bipolar disorder is a strong risk factor, with an average 10-fold increased risk among adult relatives of individuals with bipolar I and II disorders
- **Culture-Related Diagnosis**: Little information exists on cultural differences in expression, may be underdiagnosed in some populations (e.g., Afro-Caribbeans)
- **Gender-Related Diagnosis**: Females more likely to experience rapid cycling and mixed states, higher rates of lifetime eating disorders and alcohol use disorder
- **Suicide Risk**: Lifetime risk is at least 15 times that of the general population
- **Functional Consequences**: Approximately 30% show severe impairment in work role function, functional recovery lags behind symptom recovery

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- **Major Depressive Disorder**: May be accompanied by hypomanic or manic symptoms, must rely on corroborating history of past episodes
- **Other Bipolar and Related Disorders**: Distinguished based on whether the episodes involve manic or hypomanic symptoms or depressive symptoms fail to meet full criteria
- **Bipolar Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**: Distinguished by identifying a causally related medical condition
- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, PTSD, Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar Disorder, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Personality Disorders, and Disorders with Prominent Irritability**: Care must be taken to differentiate these from bipolar disorder
- **Comorbidity**: Common, most frequent disorders are anxiety disorders, ADHD, disruptive impulse control or conduct disorders, and substance use disorders

  - With seasonal pattern (applies only to major depressive episodes)
- **Course**: In partial remission, in full remission
- **Severity**: Mild, moderate, severe

**Characteristics**:
- Clinical course of recurring mood episodes:
  - Major depressive episodes (Criteria A-C under "Major Depressive Episode")
  - At least one hypomanic episode (Criteria A-F under "Hypomanic Episode")
- Major depressive episode must last at least 2 weeks
- Hypomanic episode must last at least 4 days
- Presence of manic episode precludes diagnosis
- Episodes not better accounted for by other disorders (Criteria B and C under "Bipolar II Disorder")

**Symptoms**:
- During mood episodes, symptoms present most of the day, nearly every day
- Represents a noticeable change from usual behavior and functioning
- Clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas (Criterion D)

**Comparative to Bipolar I Disorder**:
- Recurrent major depressive episodes often more frequent and lengthier
- Individuals with bipolar II disorder spend more time in the depressive phase of their illness
- Hypomanic episodes may not cause impairment, but major depressive episodes do

**Associated Features**:
- Impulsivity: contributes to suicide attempts and substance use disorders
- Creativity: heightened levels can contribute to ambivalence about seeking treatment or undermine adherence to it.

###### Prevalence, Diagnosis, and Treatment

**Prevalence**:
- 12-month prevalence: 0.3% internationally, 0.8% in the US
- Pediatric bipolar II disorder: difficult to establish
- DSM-IV: combined prevalence rate of 1.8% in community samples, higher in youths (2.7%)

**Onset and Course**:
- Can begin in late adolescence or throughout adulthood
- Average age at onset: mid-20s
- Initial diagnosis often as major depressive disorder
- Hypomanic episode occurs in about 12% of individuals
- Anxiety, substance use, or eating disorders may precede diagnosis
- Higher number of lifetime episodes compared to major depressive disorder or bipolar I disorder
- Interval between mood episodes decreases with age
- Depressive episodes are more enduring and disabling than hypomanic episodes

**Rapid Cycling**:
- Approximately 5%-15% of individuals have multiple (4+) mood episodes per year
- Noted by the specifier "with rapid cycling"
- Psychiatric comorbidities, especially anxiety disorders, are more common in rapid cycling

**Diagnosis in Children**:
- Challenging to diagnose, especially with nonepisodic irritability
- Persistently irritable youths have lower familial rates of bipolar disorder than those with episodic irritability
- Hypomanic symptoms must exceed expected level for developmental stage

**Gender Differences**:
- Gender ratio equal for bipolar I disorder
- Mixed findings on gender differences in bipolar II disorder
- Some studies suggest more common in females, others reflect gender differences in treatment seeking or other factors

**Comorbidities and Prognosis**:
- Higher rates of anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and eating disorders compared to major depressive disorder
- Poor prognosis for individuals with rapid cycling
- More education, fewer years of illness, and being married are associated with functional recovery

**Risk Factors**:
- Genetic factors influence age at onset
- Rapid-cycling pattern associated with poorer prognosis
- Childbirth may trigger hypomanic episode in females, especially postpartum

**Suicide Risk in Bipolar II Disorder**
- High suicide risk: approximately one-third of individuals with bipolar II disorder report a lifetime history of suicide attempt
- Prevalence rates of lifetime attempted suicide similar between bipolar II and I disorders (32.4% and 36.3%, respectively)
- Lethality of attempts may be higher in bipolar II disorder compared to bipolar I disorder
- Genetic markers associated with increased risk for suicidal behavior in individuals with bipolar disorder, including a 6.5-fold higher risk among first-degree relatives of bipolar II probands

**Functional Outcomes of Bipolar II Disorder**
- At least 15% of individuals with bipolar II disorder have some inter-episode dysfunction, and 20% transition directly into another mood episode without recovery
- Functional recovery lags behind symptom recovery, especially in regard to occupational function, leading to lower socioeconomic status despite equivalent education levels
- Individuals with bipolar II disorder perform poorly on cognitive tests compared to healthy individuals, except for memory and semantic fluency
- Cognitive impairments contribute to vocational difficulties
- Prolonged unemployment associated with more episodes of depression, older age, increased rates of current panic disorder, and lifetime history of alcohol use disorder

**Differential Diagnosis of Bipolar II Disorder**
- **Major depressive disorder**: characterized by hypomanic or manic symptoms that do not meet full criteria; challenging to distinguish from bipolar II disorder, especially with irritability symptoms
- **Cyclothymic disorder**: numerous periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms that do not meet major episode criteria; distinguished from bipolar II disorder by the presence of one or more major depressive episodes
- **Schizophrenia spectrum disorders**: characterized by psychotic symptoms without prominent mood symptoms; helpful considerations include accompanying symptoms, previous course, and family history
- **Panic disorder or other anxiety disorders**: frequently present as co-occurring disorders; differentiated from bipolar II disorder based on distinct episodes and noticeable increase over baseline for bipolar II disorder diagnosis
- **Substance use disorders**: included in differential diagnosis; careful consideration of symptoms, course, and family history
- **Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)**: overlaps with some symptoms of hypomania; clarify distinct episode and noticeable increase over baseline for bipolar II disorder diagnosis
- **Personality disorders**: same convention as ADHD applies when evaluating an individual for a personality disorder such as borderline personality disorder; symptoms must represent a distinct episode, and the noticeable increase over baseline required for the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder must be present
- **Other bipolar disorders and related conditions**: carefully consider presence of fully syndromal hypomania and depression to distinguish from bipolar II disorder

**Comorbidities in Bipolar II Disorder**
- Associated with one or more co-occurring mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders (approximately 75% have an anxiety disorder)
- Anxiety and substance use disorders occur at higher rates than in the general population
- Approximately 14% of individuals with bipolar II disorder have at least one lifetime eating disorder, with binge-eating disorder being more common than bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa
- Co-occurring disorders do not follow a course of illness that is truly independent from that of the bipolar disorder but rather have strong associations with mood states; anxiety and eating disorders tend to associate most with depressive symptoms, while substance use disorders are moderately associated with manic symptoms.

#### Cyclothymic Disorder (301.13)

**Cyclothymic Disorder**

**Criteria A - Cycling Moods:**
- Numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms
- Numerous periods of depressive symptoms
- Symptoms do not meet criteria for a hypomanic or major depressive episode

**Criteria B - Persistence and Duration:**

**Criteria E - Clinical Significance:**
- Cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Essential feature: chronic, fluctuating mood disturbance with hypomanic and depressive symptoms that do not meet full criteria for a hypomanic or major depressive episode.
- Hypomania: insufficient number, severity, pervasiveness, or duration to meet full criteria.
- Depression: insufficient number, severity, pervasiveness, or duration to meet full criteria.
- Persistent symptoms during the initial 2 years (1 year for children/adolescents).
- Any symptom-free intervals last no longer than 2 months.

- Clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning due to mood symptoms.

###### Prevalence, Diagnosis, and Differential Diagnosis of Cyclothymic Disorder

**Cyclothymic Disorder**

**Prevalence**:
- Approximately 0.4%-1% in the general population
- Up to 5% in mood disorder clinics

**Gender Distribution**:
- Equally common in males and females in the general population
- Females may be more likely to present for treatment than males

**Onset and Course**:
- Usually begins in adolescence or early adulthood
- Insidious onset, persistent course
- 15%-50% risk of developing bipolar I disorder or II disorder

**Differentiation from Other Conditions**:
- **Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition**: Mood disturbance attributed to a specific chronic medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism)
- **Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder, substance/medication-induced depressive disorder**: Etiologically related to substance/medication use
- **Bipolar I disorder with rapid cycling**, **bipolar II disorder with rapid cycling**: Distinguished by the presence of full mood episodes
- **Borderline personality disorder**: Associated with marked shifts in mood, may be comorbid with cyclothymic disorder

**Comorbidities**:
- Substance-related disorders and sleep disorders (insomnia) common
- Comorbidity with other mental conditions, especially attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children.

#### Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder

**Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar Disorder**

**Criteria A**:
- Prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical picture
- Characterized by elevated, expansive, or irritable mood with or without depressed mood
- Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in almost all activities

**Criteria B**:
- Symptoms developed during/soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal
- Involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms described in Criteria A

**Criteria C**:
- Disturbance not better explained by a bipolar disorder not induced by substances

**Criteria D**:
- No occurrence exclusively during delirium

**Criteria E**:
- Disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas

**Coding Note**:
- ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for substance/medication-induced bipolar disorders are indicated

**Recording Procedures**:
- Substance/medication-induced disorder begins with the specific substance that is presumed to be causing the symptoms
- Diagnostic code is selected based on the drug class and presence or absence of comorbid substance use disorder
- Separate diagnosis for substance use disorder if applicable

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Diagnostic features are similar to those of mania, hypomania, or depression
- Exception: Condition after antidepressant medication use or other treatments that persists beyond physiological effects considered true bipolar disorder, not substance/medication-induced
- Side effects of some antidepressants and psychotropic drugs (e.g., agitation) may resemble primary symptoms but are distinct and insufficient for diagnosis

**Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis**:
- **Etiology**: Causally related to use of psychotropic medications or substances of abuse based on best clinical evidence
- Substances/medications: Stimulants, phencyclidine, steroids
- History of substance use may increase diagnostic certainty

**Prevalence**:
- No epidemiological studies of substance/medication-induced mania or bipolar disorder
- Each etiological substance may have individual risk of inducing bipolar (manic/hypomanic) disorder

**Development and Course**:
- Phencyclidine: Delirium with affective features, then atypical manic/mixed state, follows ingestion quickly
- Stimulants: Response immediate, brief episode resolving in 1-2 days
- Corticosteroids/immunosuppressant medications: Mania/mixed/depressed state follows several days of ingestion, higher doses more likely to produce symptoms

**Diagnostic Markers**:
- Substance use can be identified through markers in blood or urine to corroborate diagnosis

**Differentiation from Other Conditions**:
- Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder differentiated from other bipolar disorders, substance intoxication or induced delirium, medication side effects

**Comorbidity**:
- Comorbidities associated with use of illicit substances (illegal stimulants) or diversion of prescribed stimulants
- Comorbidities related to steroid or immunosuppressant medications: medical indications for these preparations
- Delirium can occur before or along with manic symptoms in individuals ingesting phencyclidine or prescribed steroid/immuno­ suppressant medications.

#### Bipolar and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition

**Bipolar and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**

**Criteria for Diagnosis**:
- A prominent and persistent period of abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally increased activity or energy that predominates in the clinical picture (Criterion A)
- Evidence from history, physical exam, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition (Criterion B)
- The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion C)
- The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium (Criterion D)
- The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, or necessitates hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features (Criterion E)

**Specifying the Medical Condition**:
- ICD-9-CM code: 293.83, assigned regardless of specifier
- ICD-10-CM code depends on the specifier (see below)
- Include the name of the other medical condition in the name of the mental disorder (e.g., 293.83 [F06.33] bipolar disorder due to hyperthyroidism, with manic features)
- Code and list the other medical condition separately before the bipolar and related disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 242.90 [E05.90] hyperthyroidism; 293.83 [F06.33] bipolar disorder due to hyperthyroidism, with manic features)

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Presence of a prominent and persistent period of abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally increased activity or energy predominating in the clinical picture (attributable to another medical condition)
- Manic or hypomanic episode may appear during initial presentation of medical condition (Criterion B)
- Diagnosis is not made during a delirium (Criterion D)
- Distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion E)

**Associated Features Supporting the Diagnosis**:
- Etiology (i.e., causal relationship to another medical condition based on best clinical evidence) is key
- List of medical conditions known to induce mania includes Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and traumatic brain injuries
- Onset may be acute or subacute within first weeks/months of medical condition onset
- Clinician must make judgment about causation based on temporal sequence and plausibility of causal relationship
- Manic/hypomanic syndrome may remit before or just after medical condition remits, particularly with effective treatment

**Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues**:
- Culture-related differences are mainly related to the medical condition (e.g., rates of multiple sclerosis and stroke vary around the world)
- Gender differences are mainly associated with the medical condition (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus is more common in females, stroke slightly more common in middle-age males compared to females)

**Functional Consequences of Bipolar and Related Disorder**:
- Functional consequences may exacerbate impairments associated with the medical condition and incur worse outcomes due to interference with medical treatment
- Illness induced by Cushing's disease is suggested, but not established, not to recur if the condition is cured or arrested
- Mood syndromes, including depressive and manic/hypomanic ones, may be episodic with static brain injuries and other central nervous system diseases

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Symptoms of delirium, catatonia, acute anxiety must be differentiated from mania symptoms
- Medication-induced depressive or manic symptoms must be considered when determining the most likely and/or important etiological factors

**Comorbid Conditions**:
- Comorbid conditions are those associated with the medical condition of etiological relevance. Delirium can occur before or along with manic symptoms in individuals with Cushing's disease.

#### Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder (296.89)

**Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder (F31.89)**

**Application:**
- Used when symptoms characteristic of a bipolar and related disorder cause distress or impairment without meeting full criteria for any specific diagnosis
- Record "other specified bipolar and related disorder" followed by the specific reason

**Examples:**
1. **Short-duration hypomanic episodes (2-3 days) and major depressive episodes**: Lifetime history of one or more major depressive episodes without full criteria for mania or hypomania, but with two or more short-duration hypomanic episodes (lasting 2-3 days). No overlap between hypomanic and depressive episodes.
2. **Hypomanic episodes with insufficient symptoms and major depressive episodes**: Lifetime history of one or more major depressive episodes without full criteria for mania or hypomania, but with one or more hypomanic episodes not meeting full symptomatic criteria. No overlap between hypomanic and depressive episodes.
3. **Hypomanic episode without prior major depressive episode**: One or more hypomanic episodes in an individual without full criteria for major depression or mania. Can be diagnosed as persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) if present.
4. **Short-duration cyclothymia (less than 24 months)**: Multiple episodes of hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms not meeting criteria for diagnosis, persisting for less than 24 months (12 months for children/adolescents). Hypomanic or depressive symptoms present for more days than not, without being symptom-free for more than 2 months.

#### Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder (296.80)

**Specifiers for Bipolar Disorders:**

### Depressive Disorders

**Depressive Disorders**

**Types of Depressive Disorders**:
- **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMRD)**: New diagnosis for children up to 12 years old with persistent irritability and frequent episodes of extreme behavioral dyscontrol
- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**: Characterized by discrete episodes of at least 2 weeks' duration, affecting affect, cognition, and neurovegetative functions; may be recurrent
- **Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)**: Mood disturbance continuing for at least 2 years in adults or 1 year in children; includes Chronic Major Depression and Dysthymia diagnoses from DSM-IV
- **Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)**: Confirmed specific and treatment-responsive form of depressive disorder affecting women following ovulation, with remission during menstruation; has significant impact on functioning
- **Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder** and **Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**

**Differentiation from Normal Sadness or Grief**:
- Major depressive episode not typically induced by bereavement
- Bereavement may induce greater suffering and worse prognosis when accompanied by MDD
- Bereavement-related depression occurs in persons with other vulnerabilities to depressive disorders; antidepressant treatment may facilitate recovery

#### Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (296.99)

**Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)**

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- Severe recurrent temper outbursts (A): verbal or behavioral, grossly out of proportion to situation/provocation
- Inconsistent with developmental level (B)
- Occur on average 3+ times per week (C)
- Persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day (D) for at least 12 months
- Diagnosed before age 6 or after 18, with no distinct period without symptoms (E)
- Present in at least two settings (F)
- Not attributable to substance or medical condition (K)
- Does not coexist with Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Intermittent Explosive Disorder, or Bipolar Disorder but can coexist with others (J)

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Chronic, severe persistent irritability
- Two manifestations: frequent temper outbursts and chronic irritable mood
- Temper outbursts occur frequently, developmentally inappropriate, present in at least two settings for over 1 year (E, F)
- Irritable or angry mood present most of the day nearly every day observable by others (D)
- Distinguished from pediatric bipolar disorder: non-episodic severe irritability vs. classic episodic mania symptoms (DSM-5 reserved for episodic presentations).

###### Diagnosis and Impact on Childhood Development

**Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)**

**Prevalence**:
- Common among children presenting to pediatric mental health clinics
- Unclear prevalence in the community
- Estimated 2%-5% range of 6-month to 1-year period-prevalence for children and adolescents
- Higher rates in males and school-age children than females and adolescents

**Development**:
- Onset before age 10, should not be applied to children under developmental age of 6 years
- Symptoms may change as children mature, use diagnosis for similar age groups with validity established (7-18 years)
- Approximately half of children with severe, chronic irritability continue criteria 1 year later
- Very low conversion rate from severe, nonepisodic irritability to bipolar disorder
- At risk for unipolar depression and anxiety disorders in adulthood

**Age-related Variations**:
- Bipolar disorder rates very low prior to adolescence (<1%), increase into early adulthood (1-2%)
- Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder more common than bipolar disorder prior to adolescence
- Symptoms generally become less common as children transition into adulthood

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**:
- Complex psychiatric histories, chronic irritability often present before full criteria met
- Symptoms may meet criteria for ADHD, anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder from an early age
- Genetic and physiological differences compared to children with pediatric bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses
- Face-emotion labeling deficits, perturbed decision making, cognitive control present in both groups but disorder-specific dysfunction seen in children with chronic irritability

**Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues**:
- Predominantly male presentation
- Male preponderance supported by evidence from clinics and community samples
- Differentiates disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from bipolar disorder, equal gender prevalence in bipolar disorder

**Functional Consequences**:
- Marked disruption to family, peer relationships, school performance
- Severe functional consequences (dangerous behavior, suicidal ideation or attempts, severe aggression, psychiatric hospitalization) common for both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and pediatric bipolar disorder.

###### Differential Diagnosis

**Differential Diagnosis for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)**
- **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder vs. Bipolar Disorders**:
  - Central feature differentiating: Longitudinal course of core symptoms
    - In children, bipolar disorders are episodic with discrete episodes that differ from child's usual mood
    - Manic episode has distinctly different mood and accompanying cognitive/behavioral changes
    - Irritability in DMDD is persistent over months and not distinctively different during mania or hypomania
  - Can't diagnose DMDD if child has experienced full-duration manic/hypomanic episode or manic episode lasting >1 day
- **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder vs. Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)**:
  - Symptoms of ODD often present in children with DMDD, but mood symptoms are rare in ODD
  - Key features for DMDD: Severe and frequent outbursts, persistent disruption in mood between outbursts, impairment in at least one setting (home, school, peers), mild to moderate impairment in a second setting
  - Only approximately 15% of individuals with ODD meet criteria for DMDD
  - Even when symptoms meet both disorders' criteria, only DMDD diagnosis should be assigned
- **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder and Other Comorbidities**:
  - High rates of comorbidity; strong overlap with oppositional defiant disorder
  - Children often present with disruptive behavior, mood, anxiety, and autism spectrum symptoms
  - Should not diagnose DMDD if symptoms occur only in an anxiety-provoking context or during major depressive episodes
  - Only the diagnosis of DMDD should be assigned when symptoms meet criteria for both ODD/intermittent explosive disorder, but not in context of autism spectrum disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.

#### Major Depressive Disorder

**Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**

**Criteria A:**
- Five or more symptoms present during a 2-week period
- At least one symptom is either depressed mood or loss of interest/pleasure
- Do not include symptoms attributable to another medical condition

   - Observation by others (appears tearful)
2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all activities most of the day, nearly every day
3. Significant weight loss or gain without dieting
4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day
5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others)
6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day
7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive/inappropriate guilt (delusional) nearly every day
8. Diminished ability to think, concentrate, or make decisions nearly every day
9. Recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, attempt, or plan

B. **The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.**

- Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies: evidence for functional abnormalities in emotion processing, reward seeking, emotion regulation

###### Prevalence, Risk Factors, Symptoms, and Functional Consequences

**Major Depressive Disorder Prevalence and Course**

**Prevalence:**
- Approx. 7% in US, higher for 18-29 year olds (3x) vs. over 60s
- Females have a 1.5-3x higher rate than males since early adolescence
- Onset peak: 20s, but late life onset not uncommon
- Variable course: some people experience long remissions while others have frequent episodes

**Recovery:**
- Within 3 months for 1 in 5 individuals with major depression
- Recovers within a year for most (4 in 5)
- Recent onset increases likelihood of spontaneous recovery
- Features predicting lower recovery: psychotic features, prominent anxiety, personality disorders, symptom severity

**Transition to Other Disorders:**
- Some bipolar illnesses begin with depressive episodes and may later be diagnosed as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia (more frequent than the reverse)
- No clear gender or age effects on course or treatment response

**Risk Factors:**
- Temperamental: neuroticism (negative affectivity) increases risk for major depressive disorder
- Environmental: adverse childhood experiences, stressful life events are precipitants but do not guide prognosis or treatment selection
- Genetic and physiological: heritability is approximately 40%, personality trait neuroticism accounts for a substantial portion of this genetic liability
- Course modifiers: nonmood disorders, chronic medical conditions increase risk for major depressive episodes, may require appropriate treatment to improve symptoms.

**Cultural Differences:**
- Consistent differences in 12-month prevalence rates across cultures but more consistency in female-to-male ratio and mean ages at onset
- Substantial cultural differences in expression of major depressive disorder, clinicians should be aware that many cases go unrecognized and somatic symptoms may present as the primary complaint.

**Symptoms:**
- Impairment ranges from mild to complete incapacity
- Among those seen in general medical settings: more pain, physical illnesses, and decreased functioning.

###### Criteria and Differentiators

**Differential Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder**

**Manic Episodes with Irritable Mood or Mixed Episodes**:
- Distinguish from major depressive episodes and mixed episodes by careful clinical evaluation of the presence of manic symptoms
- **Mood disorder due to another medical condition**: Diagnosis if disturbance is not directly related to a specific medical condition
- **Substance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder**: Distinguished from major depressive disorder by the presence of an etiologically related substance (e.g., drug, medication, toxin)

**Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**:
- Distractibility and low frustration tolerance can occur in both ADHD and major depressive episode
- Caution against overdiagnosis of major depressive episode in children with ADHD characterized by irritability rather than sadness or loss of interest
- **Adjustment disorder with depressed mood**: Distinguished from major depressive episode by the absence of the full criteria for severity, duration, and clinically significant distress or impairment

**Other Conditions Frequently Co-occurring with Major Depressive Disorder**:
- Substance-related disorders (e.g., drug abuse, addiction)
- Panic disorder
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder
- Anorexia nervosa
- Bulimia nervosa
- Borderline personality disorder

**Sadness**:
- Periods of sadness are inherent aspects of the human experience and should not be diagnosed as major depressive episode unless criteria for severity, duration, and clinically significant distress or impairment are met

#### Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) (300.4)

**Diagnostic Criteria for Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)**

A. **Depressed mood:**
    - Most of the day, for more days than not, for at least 2 years
    - Children and adolescents: depressed mood for at least 1 year with irritable mood
B. **Symptoms:**
    - Two or more symptoms from this list:
      - Poor appetite or overeating
      - Insomnia or hypersomnia
      - Low energy or fatigue
      - Low self-esteem
      - Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions
      - Feelings of hopelessness
C. **Persistence:**
    - No symptom-free intervals lasting more than 2 months (children/adolescents: 1 year)
D. **Major depressive disorder:**
    - Criteria may be continuously present for 2 years
E. **Absence of manic or hypomanic episodes and cyclothymic disorder**
F. **Not better explained by other disorders**
G. **No physiological causes**
H. **Clinical significance:**
    - Distress or impairment in social, occupational functioning

**Additional Diagnostic Features:**
- With anxious distress (p. 184)
- With mixed features (pp. 184-185)
- With melancholic features (p. 185)
- With atypical features (pp. 185-186)
- With mood-congruent psychotic features (p. 186)
- With mood-incongruent psychotic features (p. 186)
- With peripartum onset (pp. 186-187)

**Additional Specifiers:**
- In partial remission or full remission (pp. 188 and 188)
- Early onset (under age 21) vs late onset (age 21 or older)
- With pure dysthymic syndrome, persistent major depressive episode, intermittent major depressive episodes with current episode, or intermittent major depressive episodes without current episode
- Current severity: mild, moderate, severe.

###### Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Differential Diagnosis of Persistent Depressive Disorder

**Prevalence of Persistent Depressive Disorder**
- **Persistent depressive disorder**: Amalgamation of DSM-IV dysthymic disorder and chronic major depressive episode
- 12-month prevalence in the US: Approximately **0.5%** for persistent depressive disorder and **1.5%** for chronic major depressive disorder

**Characteristics of Persistent Depressive Disorder**
- Has an early, insidious onset (childhood, adolescence, or early adult life) with a chronic course
- Individuals with both persistent depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder show covariance in corresponding features over time, suggesting a common mechanism
- **Early onset (before age 21)** is associated with higher likelihood of comorbid personality disorders and substance use disorders
- Depressive symptoms are less likely to resolve compared to major depressive episodes

**Risk and Prognostic Factors for Persistent Depressive Disorder**
- **Temperamental factors**: Poor long-term outcome associated with higher neuroticism (negative affectivity), greater symptom severity, poorer global functioning, presence of anxiety disorders or conduct disorder
- **Childhood risk factors**: Parental loss or separation
- No clear differences in illness development, course, or family history between DSM-IV dysthymic disorder and chronic major depressive order

**Functional Consequences of Persistent Depressive Disorder**
- Can impact social and occupational functioning as greatly as or greater than major depressive disorder

**Differential Diagnosis**
- **Major depressive disorder**: If depressed mood plus two or more symptoms meet criteria for a persistent depressive episode for 2 years, the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder is made
- Separate diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder is not made if depressive symptoms occur only during the course of psychotic disorders (including residual phases)
- Distinguish from **Depressive or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition** when mood disturbance can be attributed to a specific, chronic medical condition
- Distinguish from **Substance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder** when a substance is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance
- Both persistent depressive disorder and coexisting personality disorders are diagnosed if criteria are met

**Comorbidity of Persistent Depressive Disorder**
- Higher risk for psychiatric comorbidity in general, and for anxiety disorders and substance use disorders in particular, compared to individuals with major depressive disorder
- Strongly associated with DSM-IV Cluster B personality disorders, especially in early-onset cases.

#### Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (625.4)

**Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PDM)**

**Criteria for Diagnosis:**
- **Symptoms**: occur in the final week before menses, improve within a few days after onset, minimal or absent postmenses
- **Affective lability**: mood swings, sudden sadness or tears, increased sensitivity to rejection
- **Irritability or anger**: marked irritability, anger, increased interpersonal conflicts
- **Depressed mood**: feelings of hopelessness, self-deprecating thoughts
- **Anxiety, tension, and feeling keyed up**: feeling overwhelmed, out of control
- **Decreased interest in usual activities**: decreased productivity at work or school, avoidance of social activities
- **Subjective difficulty in concentration**: lethargy, easy fatigability, lack of energy
- **Appetite changes**: overeating, specific food cravings, hypersomnia or insomnia
- **Physical symptoms**: breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, bloating, weight gain

**Additional Symptoms**:
- Decreased interest in usual activities
- Subjective difficulty in concentration
- Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy
- Marked change in appetite; overeating; or specific food cravings
- Hypersomnia or insomnia
- A sense of being overwhelmed or out of control
- Physical symptoms such as breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, a sensation of “bloating,” or weight gain

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Expression of mood lability, irritability, dysphoria, and anxiety symptoms that occur repeatedly during the premenstrual phase and remit around menstruation onset
- Symptoms must have occurred in most menstrual cycles in the past year and adversely affect work or social functioning
- Symptom intensity is comparable to other mental disorders like major depressive episode or generalized anxiety disorder but not their duration

**Confirming Diagnosis**:
- Daily prospective symptom ratings required for at least two symptomatic cycles to confirm a provisional diagnosis

**Associated Features:**
- Delusions and hallucinations are rare in the late luteal phase of menstruation cycle
- Premenstrual phase considered a risk period for suicide.

###### Prevalence and Diagnostic Criteria of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder

**Prevalence of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder**
- Estimated prevalence based on daily records: 1.8% for full criteria without functional impairment, 1.3% with current criteria and functional impairment
- Methodology affects estimates: prospective ratings more accurate than retrospective reports
- Onset and Course
  - Can occur at any point after menarche
  - New cases over a 40-month follow-up period: 2.5% (1.7-3.7%)
  - Symptoms cease after menopause, may return with hormone replacement therapy

**Risk Factors**
- Environmental: stress, history of interpersonal trauma, seasonal changes, sociocultural aspects of female sexual behavior and gender role
- Genetic and physiological: heritability unknown but estimated to be between 30% and 80%, with a stable component of about 50% for premenstrual symptoms
- Culture-Related Issues: not culture-bound, observed in various cultures; cultural influences on frequency, intensity, expressivity, and help-seeking patterns

**Diagnostic Markers**
- Confirm diagnosis through prospective symptom ratings for at least 2 months
- Scales used for clinical trials: Daily Rating of Severity of Problems, Visual Analogue Scales for Premenstrual Mood Symptoms, Premenstrual Tension Syndrome Rating Scale (self-report and observer versions)

**Functional Consequences**
- Clinically meaningful distress or marked impairment in social or occupational functioning prior to menstruation
- Manifestations: marital discord, problems with children, family members, or friends; chronic issues should not be confused with dysfunction associated with premenstrual dysphoric disorder.

###### Differentiation of Premenstrual Disorders: Diagnostic Considerations

**Differential Diagnosis**

**Premenstrual Syndrome vs Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder:**
- **Premenstrual syndrome**: less severe, no stipulation of affective symptoms, and minimum of 5 symptoms not required. Prevalence varies.
- **Premenstrual dysphoric disorder**: requires 5 or more affective symptoms, onset before menses, and no improvement during menstruation.
- Overlap in symptoms, particularly with mood disorders like bipolar or depression.

**Other Considerations:**
- **Dysmenorrhea**: painful menses, but distinct from premenstrual dysphoric disorder due to symptom timing.
- **Bipolar disorder**, **major depressive disorder**, and **persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)**: women may believe they have PMDD based on retrospective symptoms; requirement for daily prospective ratings.

**Hormonal Treatments:**
- Women using hormones may experience premenstrual symptoms due to the use of these substances rather than an underlying condition.

**Comorbidities:**
- **Major depressive episode**: most frequently reported previous disorder in individuals with PMDD.
- Other mental or physical disorders may worsen during premenstrual phase but do not meet criteria for PMDD; considered as premenstrual exacerbation of ongoing disorder.

**Use of Hormonal Treatments:**
- Symptoms occurring after initiation of hormone use may be due to the medication itself rather than underlying condition.
- Disappearance of symptoms upon stopping hormones supports diagnosis of substance/medication-induced depressive disorder.

#### Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder

**Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder**

A. **Clinical Picture**:
    - Prominent disturbance in mood characterized by:
      - Depressed mood or
      - Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all activities
B. **Evidence of Substance/Medication Involvement**:
    1. Symptoms developed during or soon after substance intoxication, withdrawal, or exposure to medication
    2. Capable of producing symptoms characterized by depressed mood or diminished interest/pleasure
    3. Disturbance not better explained by an independent depressive disorder
C. **Other Conditions**:
    - Doesn't occur exclusively during delirium
    - Causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational functioning
D. **Diagnosis Criteria vs. Intoxication/Withdrawal**:
    - This diagnosis is made instead of substance intoxication/withdrawal only when symptoms predominate and are severe enough for clinical attention

**Coding Note**:
- ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for specific substance/medication-induced depressive disorders provided in the table
- For comorbid substance use disorder, the 4th position character varies based on severity (mild, moderate, or severe)

###### Diagnostic Criteria

**Diagnostic Features of Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder**

**Symptoms:**
- Symptoms of major depressive disorder
- Depressive symptoms associated with substance use or medication
- Persist beyond expected length of physiological effects, intoxication, or withdrawal period (Criterion Bl)

**Diagnosis:**
- Not better explained by an independent depressive disorder (Criteria C and E):
  * Preceded onset of substance use
  * Persists beyond substantial period after cessation of substance use
  * Other evidence suggests existence of primary depressive disorder
- Not made when symptoms occur exclusively during delirium (Criterion D)

**Evidence:**
- Clinical history: substance ingestion, injection, inhalation, or psychotropic/other medication use
- Physical examination or laboratory findings

**Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder vs. Primary Depressive Disorder:**
- Substance/medication induces depressive disorder symptoms (Criteria A and B)
- Consider onset, course, and other factors associated with substance use
- Clinical judgment required to determine causation in some cases (e.g., pre-existing condition and medication treatment)

###### Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Suicide Risk

**Prevalence**:
- Lifetime prevalence of substance/medication-induced depressive disorder: 0.26%
- Development and Course:
  - Onset occurs while using the substance or during withdrawal, if there is a withdrawal syndrome
  - Mostly within first few weeks to 1 month of use
  - Symptoms remit within days to several weeks after discontinuing substance
- If symptoms persist beyond expected time course of withdrawal, consider other causes

**Evidence of Causality**:
- Most reports are from post-marketing surveillance studies, retrospective observational studies, or case reports
- Evidence for causality is difficult to determine

**Substances Implicated in Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder**:
- Antiviral agents (e.g., efavirenz)
- Cardiovascular agents (e.g., clonidine, guanethidine, methyldopa, reserpine)
- Retinoic acid derivatives (isotretinoin)
- Antidepressants
- Anticonvulsants
- Anti-migraine agents (triptans)
- Antipsychotics
- Hormonal agents (e.g., corticosteroids, oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, tamoxifen)
- Smoking cessation agents (varenicline)
- Immunological agents (interferon)
- Other potential substances continue to emerge as new compounds are synthesized

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**:

**Common to all Drugs**:
- History of major depressive disorder
- History of drug-induced depression
- Psychosocial stressors

**Type-Specific Medication Risks**:
- High doses (>80 mg/day) of corticosteroids or high plasma concentrations of efavirenz
- High estrogen/progesterone content in oral contraceptives
- Increased immune activation prior to treatment for hepatitis C associated with interferon-a-induced depression

**Course Modifiers**:
- Male gender
- Black race
- Lack of insurance and lower family income
- Higher 12-month history of stressful life events
- Greater number of DSM-IV major depressive disorder criteria
- More likely to report worthlessness, insomnia/hypersomnia, thoughts of death and suicide attempts, but less likely to report depressed mood and parental loss by death before age 18

**Diagnostic Markers**:
- Laboratory assays for suspected substance in blood or urine can corroborate diagnosis
- Suicide Risk:
  - Treatment-emergent suicidal ideation must be distinguished from underlying primary mental disorders
  - U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee considered meta-analyses of 99,839 participants in 372 randomized clinical trials: no increased risk of suicide or ideation overall, but elevated risk in patients ages 18-24
  - Absolute risk of suicide in patients taking investigational antidepressants is 0.01%

###### Comorbidity and Differential Diagnosis

**Differential Diagnosis for Depressive Symptoms with Substance Use**
- **Substance intoxication and withdrawal:**
  - Depressive symptoms occur commonly
  - Diagnosis of substance-specific intoxication or withdrawal usually sufficient
  - If severe mood symptoms, consider substance-induced depressive disorder
- **Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder:**
  - Etiologically related to substance use or withdrawal
  - Distinguished from primary depressive disorder
- **Depressive disorder due to another medical condition:**
  - Consider possibility of medical condition causing mood symptoms
  - Clinician may need to change treatment for other medical condition to determine causation
  - If both conditions contribute, diagnose both disorders
- **Comorbidity:**
  - Higher rates of comorbidity with any DSM-IV mental disorder in individuals with substance/medication-induced depressive disorder compared to major depressive disorder and no comorbid substance use disorder
  - More likely to have alcohol use disorder, any other substance use disorder, and histrionic personality disorder in those with comorbidity
  - Less likely to have persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) in individuals with comorbidity.

#### Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- A prominent and persistent period of depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all activities that predominates (Criterion A)
- Evidence from history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct physiological consequence of another medical condition (Criterion B)
- Disturbance not better explained by another mental disorder like adjustment disorder with depressed mood or occurring exclusively during a delirium (Criteria C and D)
- Causing clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion E)

**Coding:**
- ICD-9-CM: 293.83, assigned regardless of the specific medical condition
- ICD-10-CM depends on the specific medical condition

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Establishing presence and etiological relationship to another medical condition
- Temporal association between mood disturbance and medical condition onset, exacerbation, or remission
- Atypical features for primary mood disorders like age at onset or absence of family history
- Evidence from literature suggesting direct association between conditions and depression development

**Associated Features:**
- Etiology: causal relationship to another medical condition based on best clinical evidence
- Risk factors, such as gender differences or diagnostic markers associated with the medical condition
- Suicide risk no less than that for other forms of major depressive episode, might even be greater

**Functional Consequences:**
- Believed but not established that a major depressive episode induced by Cushing's disease will not recur if cured or arrested.

###### Differentiating Depressive Disorders from Medical Conditions

**Differential Diagnosis: Depression Not Due to Another Medical Condition**

**Medical Condition Accompanying Depressive Disorder:**
- Determination of whether medical condition caused depression depends on three factors:
  * Absence of depressive episodes prior to onset of medical condition
  * Probability that associated medical condition has potential to promote or cause depressive disorder
  * Course of depressive symptoms shortly after onset or worsening of medical condition, especially if they remit with effective treatment
- Some medical conditions treated with medications may induce depressive or manic symptoms (e.g., steroids or alpha-interferon)
  * Clinical judgment is necessary to separate most likely and important etiological factors

**Adjustment Disorders:**
- Differentiate depressive episode from adjustment disorder due to onset of medical condition as a life stressor
- Pervasiveness and number of depressive symptoms are key distinguishing features

**Comorbid Conditions with Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition:**
- Co-morbid conditions associated with medical conditions of etiological relevance (e.g., delirium occurring before or along with depressive symptoms in individuals with various medical conditions)
- Anxiety symptoms, usually generalized, are common in depressive disorders regardless of cause.

#### Other Specified Depressive Disorder

**Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.8)**
- Applicable for presentations that do not meet criteria for any specific depressive disorder but still cause significant distress or impairment
- **Categorization**: "other specified depressive disorder" followed by the specific reason
- Examples:
  - **Recurrent brief depression:** Present with depressed mood and at least four other symptoms of depression for 2-13 days, at least once a month for 12 consecutive months. Never met criteria for any other depressive or bipolar disorder, and does not currently meet active or residual criteria for psychotic disorder.
  - **Short-duration depressive episode (4-13 days):** Depressed affect and at least four symptoms of major depressive episode associated with clinically significant distress or impairment. Persists for more than 4 days but less than 14 days. Never met criteria for any other depressive or bipolar disorder, does not currently meet active or residual criteria for psychotic disorder, and does not meet criteria for recurrent brief depression or mixed anxiety-depressive symptoms.
  - **Depressive episode with insufficient symptoms:** Depressed affect and at least one symptom of major depressive episode associated with clinically significant distress or impairment. Persists for at least 2 weeks. Never met criteria for any other depressive or bipolar disorder, does not currently meet active or residual criteria for psychotic disorder, and does not meet criteria for mixed anxiety-depressive symptoms.

#### Unspecified Depressive Disorder

- Homesickness and misery when away from home
- Unusual perceptual experiences when alone in the evening or dark.

###### Prevalence and Characteristics of Separation Anxiety Disorder

**Prevalence of Separation Anxiety Disorder:**
- In the US: 0.9%-1.9% for adults, 4% in children (6-12 years), 1.6% in adolescents
- More prevalent in females than males in the community
- Decreases from childhood to adulthood and most common anxiety disorder in children under 12

**Development and Course:**
- Heightened separation anxiety a normal part of development for secure attachment relationships
- Onset: preschool age or any time during childhood/adolescence
- Periods of exacerbation and remission
- May persist into adulthood, limiting ability to cope with changes (moving, marriage)
- Majority of children free of impairing anxiety disorders over their lifetimes
- Some adults may not recall childhood onset but experience discomfort when separated from attachment figures

**Manifestations by Age:**
- Younger children: reluctant to go to school or avoid it altogether
- Children (6+ years): worries emerge about dangers and vague concerns about reunification
- Adults: limit independent activities away from home, overconcerned about offspring/spouse, discomfort when separated, may experience significant disruption in work/social experiences

**Risk Factors:**
- Environmental: life stress, such as loss or change (divorce, moving), parental overprotection
- Genetic and physiological: heritability estimated at 73% for community sample of 6-year-old twins, children with separation anxiety disorder display enhanced sensitivity to respiratory stimulation using COT enriched air
- Culture-related issues: variations in cultural expectations regarding tolerance to separation and age at which offspring leave home

**Gender Differences:**
- Girls manifest greater reluctance/avoidance of school than boys
- Indirect expression of fear of separation more common in males, for example, limited independent activity or distress when spouse/offspring do things independently

**Suicide Risk:**
- Increased risk for suicide in children with separation anxiety disorder
- Association between presence of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use, and suicidal ideation and attempts is not specific to separation anxiety disorder.

###### Differentiating Separation Anxiety Disorder from Other Conditions

**Differential Diagnosis: Separation Anxiety Disorder vs. Other Conditions**

**Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**
- Distinguished from separation anxiety disorder by predominance of attachment figure concerns and lack of other worries

**Separation Anxiety Disorder vs. Panic Disorder:**
- Threats of separation may lead to extreme anxiety, but in separation anxiety disorder, anxiety is about the possibility of being away from attachment figures
- In panic disorder, incapacitation due to unexpected attacks is central

**Agoraphobia:**
- Unlike individuals with agoraphobia, those with separation anxiety disorder are not anxious about being trapped or incapacitated in situations

**Conduct Disorder:**
- School avoidance in conduct disorder is different from anxiety about separation in separation anxiety disorder

**Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia):**
- School refusal due to fear of judgment rather than separation anxiety

**Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):**
- Fear of separation from loved ones is common after traumatic events, but central symptoms concern memories and avoidance of the traumatic event itself in PTSD

**Illness Anxiety Disorder:**
- Worries about illnesses vs. attachment figure concerns

**Bereavement:**
- Intense yearning, sorrow, and preoccupation with deceased vs. fear of separation from other attachment figures

**Depressive and Bipolar Disorders:**
- Reluctance to leave home but not necessarily about attachment figure worries
- Individuals with separation anxiety disorder may become depressed during or anticipating separation

**Oppositional Defiant Disorder:**
- Opposition to separation only in the context of attachment figures

**Psychotic Disorders:**
- Unusual perceptual experiences based on misperceptions vs. based on actual stimuli in separation anxiety disorder

**Personality Disorders:**
- Dependent personality disorder vs. concern about proximity and safety of main attachment figures
- Borderline personality disorder with fear of abandonment but additional symptoms not present in separation anxiety disorder

**Comorbidities:**
- High comorbidity with generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia in children; common comorbidities in adults include specific phobia, PTSD, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and personality disorders
- Depressive and bipolar disorders also comorbid with separation anxiety disorder in adults.

#### Selective Mutism

**Selective Mutism: Diagnostic Criteria (F94.0)**
* Failure to speak in specific social situations despite speaking elsewhere (e.g., at home)
* Interferes with educational or occupational achievement and social communication
* Duration of at least 1 month, not limited to first month of school
* Not attributable to lack of knowledge or comfort with spoken language
* Not better explained by communication disorder or other psychiatric disorders (except for autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, or another psychotic disorder)

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Children do not initiate speech or respond when spoken to in social interactions
- Lack of speech occurs during social interactions with children and adults
- Speech refusal may be marked by high social anxiety
- Academic impairment due to lack of communication with teachers
- May use nonverbal communication methods or perform in nonverbal parts of school plays
- Associated features: excessive shyness, fear of social embarrassment, clinging, compulsive traits, negativism, temper tantrums, mild oppositional behavior.

**Prevalence:**
- Rare disorder, ranging from 0.03% to 1% depending on setting and age group
- No difference in prevalence by sex or race/ethnicity
- More common in young children than adolescents and adults

**Onset:**
- Usually before age 5 years but may not come to clinical attention until school entry
- Persistence of the disorder is variable, some individuals "outgrow" it while others do not.

**Risk Factors:**
- Temperamental factors: negative affectivity (neuroticism) or behavioral inhibition
- Parental history of shyness, social isolation, and social anxiety
- Subtle receptive language difficulties compared with peers
- Social inhibition on the part of parents
- Shared genetic factors with social anxiety disorder.

**Functional Consequences:**
- Social impairment due to anxiousness in engaging in reciprocal social interaction with others
- Increasing social isolation as children mature
- Academic impairment due to lack of communication with teachers regarding academic or personal needs.

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Distinguish from speech disorders not restricted to a specific social situation (language disorder, speech sound disorder, childhood-onset fluency disorder, pragmatic communication disorder)
- Autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, intellectual disability: diagnose selective mutism when child has an established capacity to speak in some social situations.

**Comorbidities:**
- Other anxiety disorders (most commonly social anxiety disorder)
- Oppositional behaviors limited to situations requiring speech
- Communication delays or disorders.

#### Specific Phobia

**Specific Phobia Diagnostics**

**Criteria A-G**:
- **A.** Marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation:
    - Fear may be expressed as crying, tantrums, freezing, or clinging in children.
    - Fear must be immediate and intense.
    - Fear not necessarily present on every encounter with the phobic stimulus, but should be present more often than not.
- **B.** Phobic object or situation provokes fear or anxiety:
    - Avoidance behavior is common when possible.
    - If avoidance isn't possible, intense fear or anxiety occurs.
- **C.** Fear or anxiety out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the phobic stimulus:
    - Individuals may overestimate the danger in their feared situations.
    - Sociocultural context should be considered.
- **D.** Persistent fear, anxiety, or avoidance for 6 months or more.
- **E.** Fear causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Specifiers**:
- Animal (e.g., spiders, insects, dogs)
- Natural environment (e.g., heights, storms, water)
- Blood-injection-injury (e.g., needles, invasive medical procedures)
    - Subtypes: F40.230 fear of blood; F40.231 fear of injections and transfusions; F40.232 fear of other medical care; or F40.233 fear of injury.
- Situational (e.g., airplanes, elevators, enclosed places)
- Other (e.g., situations that may lead to choking or vomiting; in children, e.g., loud sounds or costumed characters).

**Multiple Phobias**:
- Individuals can have multiple specific phobias.
- Multiple diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 codes should be given for such cases.

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Fear or anxiety is circumscribed to the presence of a particular situation or object (the phobic stimulus).
- Fear/anxiety may vary in intensity across different encounters with the phobic stimulus, but should be present on most such occasions.
- Avoidance behaviors are common when possible; if avoidance isn't possible, intense fear or anxiety occurs.
- The individual's fear is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the phobic situation/object.
- The disorder is persistent and causes significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

###### Prevalence and Characteristics of Specific Phobia in Different Populations

**Prevalence:**
- Community prevalence of specific phobia in US: 7%-9%
- Rates lower in some countries, higher in others (Europe: about 6%, Asia/Africa/Latin America: 2%-4%)
- Higher prevalence in children and adolescents (approximately 16% among 13-17-year-olds)
- Lower rates for older individuals (about 3%-5%)
- Females more frequently affected than males with a ratio of approximately 2:1
- Phobias vary by gender: females predominantly have animal, natural environment, and situational phobias while blood-injection-injury phobia is equally experienced by both genders

**Development:**
- Can develop following traumatic event or observation of others going through trauma
- Often develops in early childhood, with most cases prior to age 10 years and median age at onset between 7-11 years
- Situational specific phobias tend to have a later age at onset than natural environment, animal, or blood-injection-injury specific phobias
- May wax and wane during childhood but unlikely to remit in adulthood
- Children may express fears differently than adults; clinicians should consider impairment, duration, and developmental appropriateness before diagnosing
- Prevalent in older adults despite lower rates and can be associated with decreased quality of life and increased risk for major neurocognitive disorder

**Risk Factors:**
- Temperamental (negative affectivity or behavioral inhibition) and environmental risk factors are risk factors for other anxiety disorders as well
- Genetic susceptibility to certain specific phobias, such as blood-injection-injury phobia and vasovagal syncope
- Culture-related diagnostic issues: lower prevalence in some countries, different phobia content, age at onset, and gender ratios

**Suicide Risk:**
- Individuals with specific phobia are up to 60% more likely to make a suicide attempt than those without the diagnosis
- Elevated rates may be due to comorbidity with personality disorders and other anxiety disorders

**Functional Consequences:**
- Impairments in occupational, interpersonal functioning, and quality of life
- Fear of falling in older adults can lead to reduced mobility and physical/social functioning
- Individuals with blood-injection-injury phobia may be reluctant to seek medical care

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Agoraphobia: if one agoraphobic situation is feared, specific phobia can be diagnosed; if two or more are feared, agoraphobia is likely warranted
- Social anxiety disorder: fear due to negative evaluation, social anxiety disorder should be diagnosed instead of specific phobia
- Separation anxiety disorder: fear because of separation from primary caregiver/attachment figure, separation anxiety disorder should be diagnosed instead of specific phobia
- Panic Disorder: panic attacks only in response to specific object or situation, specific phobia diagnosis; unexpected panic attacks without this distinction, panic disorder diagnosis
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder: primary fear is due to obsessions and other diagnostic criteria for OCD are met, then OCD should be diagnosed instead of specific phobia
- Trauma-related disorders: if develops following a traumatic event, PTSD may be considered but not assigned if all criteria for PTSD are not met; if not related to trauma, specific phobia diagnosis is appropriate
- Eating Disorders: avoidance behavior limited only to food and food-related cues, anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa should be diagnosed instead of specific phobia
- Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders: fear due to delusional thinking, specific phobia diagnosis not warranted.

#### Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)

**Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)**

**Diagnostic Criteria (F40.1 0):**
* A. Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations involving exposure to scrutiny by others:
  * Social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people)
  * Being observed (e.g., eating or drinking)
  * Performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech)
* B. The individual fears negative evaluation, believing that they will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be humiliating or embarrassing, leading to rejection or offense:
  * Fear of being judged as anxious, weak, crazy, stupid, boring, intimidating, dirty, or unlikable
* C. Social situations provoke fear or anxiety almost always:
  * In children, fear or anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults
  * Anticipatory anxiety may sometimes be far in advance of upcoming situations (e.g., worrying every day for weeks before attending a social event)
* D. The individual avoids or endures the feared social situations with intense fear or anxiety:
  * Extensive avoidance (e.g., not going to parties, refusing school) or subtle methods (overpreparing, diverting attention, limiting eye contact)
  * Fear may be out of proportion to actual risk and consequences of negative evaluation
* E. Duration typically lasting for 6 months or more
* F. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning:
  * Avoidance of job opportunities due to symptoms
  * Seeking employment in jobs with minimal social contact
  * Self-medication with substances (e.g., drinking before parties)
* G. Not attributable to physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition
* H. No better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder:
  * If another medical condition is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or excessive (e.g., paruresis)

**Performance Only Type:**
* Performance only type involves fear of speaking or performing in public without fearing non-performance social situations:
  * Fears most impairing in professional lives (musicians, dancers, performers, athletes) or roles requiring public speaking
  * Performances may also manifest in work and academic settings with regular public presentations.

###### Prevealence

**Prevalence and Demographics:**
- **12-month prevalence estimate (US):** Approximately 7%
- Lower rates found in Europe (median: 2.3%) and other countries
- Comparable rates for children, adolescents, and older adults
- Higher rates in females than males (odds ratios: 1.5 to 2.2)
- Persons of Asian descent have lower rates; higher in American Indians
- Age at onset: median is 13 years, often emerges between 8-15 years
- Onset may follow stressful or humiliating experiences or be insiduous
- More persistent for individuals presenting to clinical care

**Risk and Prognostic Factors:**
- **Underlying traits:** Behavioral inhibition, fear of negative evaluation
- No causative role in development, but childhood maltreatment a risk factor
- Genetic influence with gene-environment interaction
- Culture-related: Taijin kyofusho (Japan and Korea) presents as social anxiety disorder or body dysmorphic disorder/delusional disorder
- Immigrant status linked to lower rates, except in non-Latino whites
- Societies with strong collectivistic orientations may report high self-reported levels but low prevalence
- Females: more social fears, comorbid disorders (depressive, bipolar, anxiety), more likely fear dating and use alcohol or drugs to relieve symptoms
- Paruresis more common in males

**Functional Consequences:**
- Social anxiety disorder associated with school dropout, decreased well-being, employment, socioeconomic status, quality of life
- Impairment in caregiving duties and volunteer activities for older adults
- Prevalence: Only about half seek treatment after 15-20 years of experiencing symptoms.

###### Social Anxiety Disorder: Diagnosis and Comorbidities

**Differential Diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)**

**Normative Shyness vs. Pathological Shyness**:
- Normative shyness is a common personality trait and not pathological
- When there is significant adverse impact on social, occupational, and other important areas, SAD should be considered

**Agoraphobia**:
- Individuals with agoraphobia may fear and avoid social situations due to difficulty escaping or help availability
- In SAD, individuals are most fearful of scrutiny by others

**Panic Disorder**:
- Individuals with panic disorder have a concern about the panic attacks themselves
- In SAD, the concern is about negative evaluation, not just the panic attack

**Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**:
- GAD involves excessive worries about ongoing relationships, not just social performance and evaluation

**Separation Anxiety Disorder**:
- Individuals with separation anxiety disorder may avoid social situations due to attachment figure concerns, not just negative evaluation

**Specific Phobias**:
- Individuals with specific phobias have fears of embarrassment or humiliation but not negative evaluation in other situations

**Selective Mutism**:
- Selective mutism is not the same as SAD, as it pertains to specific situations and not social performance

**Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**:
- MDD involves a concern about being negatively evaluated due to personal worth, not just social behavior

**Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD)**:
- BDD may lead to social anxiety and avoidance when the appearance concerns are the sole focus
- If social fears and avoidance are independent of the BDD focus, a separate SAD diagnosis is not warranted

**Delusional Disorder**:
- Delusional disorder involves non-bizarre delusions related to being rejected or offending others
- Individuals with SAD typically have good insight that their beliefs are out of proportion

**Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**:
- ASD involves social and communication deficits, while SAD individuals have adequate social relationships and communication

**Personality Disorders**:
- Avoidant personality disorder is the most common comorbidity with SAD
- Social anxiety disorder is typically more comorbid with avoidant personality disorder than other personality disorders

**Other Mental Disorders**:
- Schizophrenia may involve social fears, but other psychotic symptoms are usually present
- In eating disorders, fear of negative evaluation about the symptoms or behaviors should be determined before a SAD diagnosis is applied
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder may be associated with social anxiety, but the additional diagnosis of SAD is used only when the social fears and avoidance are independent of the obsessions and compulsions

**Medical Conditions**:
- Medical conditions may produce symptoms that may be embarrassing, leading to excessive fear of negative evaluation

**Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)**:
- Refusal to speak due to opposition to authority figures should be differentiated from failure to speak due to fear of negative evaluation

**Comorbidities**:
- SAD is often comorbid with other anxiety disorders, MDD, and substance use disorders
- Chronic social isolation in SAD may result in MDD
- Comorbidity with depression is high also in older adults
- Substances may be used as self-medication for social fears, but the symptoms of intoxication or withdrawal can also be a source of further social fear

#### Panic Disorder

**Diagnostic Criteria for Panic Disorder (F41.0)**
- **Recurrent unexpected panic attacks**:
  - Sudden surge of intense fear or discomfort
  - Symptoms reach a peak within minutes
  - At least 4 out of 13 physical and cognitive symptoms occur during the attack
    - Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate
    - Sweating
    - Trembling or shaking
    - Shortness of breath or smothering
    - Feeling of choking
    - Chest pain or discomfort
    - Nausea or abdominal distress
    - Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting
    - Chills or heat sensations
    - Paresthesias (numbness or tingling)
    - Derealization (unreality) or depersonalization
    - Fear of losing control or "going crazy"
    - Fear of dying
  - Culture-specific symptoms may be present, but do not count as a symptom

- **Persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks**:
  - Panic attack consequences (e.g., heart attack, mental instability)
  - Significant behavior changes to avoid attacks (e.g., exercise or situation avoidance)

- **Diagnostic Features of Panic Disorder**
  - Recurrent unexpected panic attacks
  - Variable frequency and severity of attacks
  - Concerns about physical and mental health, social consequences, or losing control

- **Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis**:
  - Nocturnal panic attack: waking from sleep in a state of panic
  - Constant or intermittent feelings of anxiety related to broader health concerns
  - Intolerance of medication side effects
  - Pervasive concerns about daily tasks, drug use, or extreme behaviors to control panic attacks

###### Epidemiology and Risk Factors of Panic Disorder in Various Populations

**Prevalence**
- **12-month prevalence**: 2%-3% in adults and adolescents across the US and Europe
- Lower rates among Latinos, African Americans, Caribbean blacks, Asian Americans compared to non-Latino whites; higher rates among American Indians
- Lower estimates for Asia (0.1%-0.8%), Africa, Latin America
- Females more frequently affected than males (approximately 2:1)
- Higher rates in adolescence and early adulthood (peak in the 20s); declines with age (0.7% in over 65s)

**Development and Course**
- **Onset**: median age at onset is 20-24 years, but can occur in childhood or after age 45
- Chronic but waxing and waning course without treatment
- Comorbidity with other anxiety disorders, depression, substance use disorders
- Children rarely affected, except for "fearful spells"
- Older adults may attribute attacks to certain situations; under-endorse unexpected attacks

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**
- **Temperamental**: negative affectivity (neuroticism), anxiety sensitivity
- **Environmental**: history of "fearful spells", childhood sexual/physical abuse, smoking
- Genetic: multiple genes confer vulnerability; increased risk for offspring of parents with anxiety, depressive, or bipolar disorders
- Cultural: variations in symptom reporting and attribution, cultural syndromes like ataque de nervios

**Diagnostic Issues**
- Variations in symptom presentation and attribution across cultures
- Higher rates of functional impairment, economic costs, medical visits compared to other anxiety disorders

**Suicide Risk**
- Higher rate of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation among individuals with panic disorder

**Functional Consequences**
- High levels of social, occupational, physical disability; considerable economic costs; highest number of medical visits among anxiety disorders.

###### Diagnostic Criteria for Panic Disorder: ICD-10 and DSM-5

**Differential Diagnosis for Panic Disorder**

**Other Specified Anxiety Disorder or Unspecified Anxiety Disorder:**
- If full-symptom (unexpected) panic attacks have never been experienced, consider other specified anxiety disorder or unspecified anxiety diagnosis.

**Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition:**
- Panic attacks are a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition:
  - Hyperthyroidism
  - Hyperparathyroidism
  - Pheochromocytoma
  - Vestibular dysfunctions
  - Seizure disorders
  - Cardiopulmonary conditions (e.g., arrhythmias, asthma, COPD)
- Appropriate lab tests or physical exams may be helpful in determining the etiological role of another medical condition.

**Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder:**
- Panic attacks are a direct physiological consequence of substance intoxication or withdrawal:
  - Central nervous system stimulants (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine) or cannabis
  - Withdrawal from central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates)
- If panic attacks continue outside of substance use context, consider a diagnosis of panic disorder.
- Detailed history needed to determine if individual had panic attacks prior to excessive substance use and self-medication attempts.

**Other Mental Disorders with Panic Attacks as an Associated Feature:**
- Unexpected panic attacks not meeting criteria for panic disorder when associated with other anxiety disorders or psychotic disorders:
  - Social anxiety disorder
  - Specific phobia
  - Agoraphobia
  - Generalized anxiety disorder
  - Separation anxiety disorder

**Comorbidity:**
- Elevated prevalence of comorbidities, particularly other anxiety disorders (and especially agoraphobia), major depression, bipolar disorder, and mild alcohol use disorder.
- Panic disorder often precedes these disorders or occurs as a severity marker.

**Comorbid Medical Symptoms:**
- Significant comorbidity with numerous general medical symptoms and conditions: dizziness, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperthyroidism, asthma, COPD, irritable bowel syndrome.
- Unclear association between panic disorder and these conditions.

##### Panic Attack Specifier

**Panic Attack Specifier**

**Identifying a Panic Attack:**
- Symptoms for identification purposes only
- Not a mental disorder to be coded
- Can occur in various mental disorders and medical conditions

**Characteristics of a Panic Attack:**
- Abrupt surge of intense fear or discomfort peaking within minutes
- Four or more physical and cognitive symptoms occurring
  *Physical Symptoms:* palpitations, pounding heart, accelerated heart rate, sweating, trembling or shaking, shortness of breath, chest pain or discomfort, nausea or abdominal distress, dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting, chills or heat sensations, paresthesias
  *Cognitive Symptoms:* fear of losing control or "going crazy," fear of dying
- Culture-specific symptoms may apply but do not count as one of the four required symptoms

**Types of Panic Attacks:**
- Expected: has an obvious cue or trigger, such as situations where panic attacks have typically occurred
- Unexpected: no obvious cue or trigger at the time of occurrence (e.g., when relaxing or out of sleep)
  *Determining Type:* clinician's judgment based on questioning and individual's judgment

**Panic Attacks and Other Disorders:**
- Can occur in various mental disorders and medical conditions, but recurrent unexpected panic attacks are required for a diagnosis of panic disorder
- Higher rate of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation

**Note:** Culture-specific symptoms may be seen during a panic attack. These symptoms should not count as one of the four required symptoms.

###### "Prevalence and Characteristics of Panic Attacks: Cross-Cultural Perspectives"

**Prevalence of Panic Attacks**

**12-Month Prevalence**:
- In the US: 11.2% in adults
- No significant differences seen between African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos
- Lower estimates for European countries: 2.7% to 3.3%
- Females more frequently affected than males, especially for panic disorder
- Rare in children under puberty, prevalence increases with age but declines in older individuals

**Mean Age at Onset**: Approximately 22-23 years old

**Risk Factors**
- **Temperamental**: Negative affectivity (neuroticism) and anxiety sensitivity are risks
- **Environmental**: Smoking is a risk; most report stressors before first attack

**Cultural Variations**
- Cultural interpretations may influence expected vs. unexpected attacks
- Culture-specific symptoms, but should not count as full panic attack
- Differences in frequency and symptom profiles across cultures

**Gender Differences**: More common in females, but no differences in symptoms

**Physiological Characteristics**: Abrupt arousal surges, often preceded by cardiorespiratory instability

**Associations with Other Conditions**: Increased severity, comorbidity, suicidality, and poorer treatment response compared to limited-symptom attacks.

###### Diagnosing Panic Attacks: Medical Conditions, Substances, and Comorbidities

**Diagnostic Considerations for Paroxysmal Episodes**

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- **Other paroxysmal episodes (e.g., "anger attacks")**: Not diagnosed as panic attacks if they do not involve an abrupt surge of intense fear or discomfort, but rather other emotional states (e.g., anger, grief).

**Medical Conditions:**
- **Panic disorder due to another medical condition**: Medical conditions that can cause or be misdiagnosed as panic attacks include:
  - Hyperthyroidism
  - Hyperparathyroidism
  - Phaeochromocytoma
  - Vestibular dysfunctions
  - Seizure disorders
  - Cardiopulmonary conditions (e.g., arrhythmias, supraventricular tachycardia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
- **Appropriate diagnostic tests**: Laboratory tests (e.g., serum calcium levels for hyperparathyroidism; Holter monitor for arrhythmias) or physical examinations (e.g., for cardiac conditions) may be helpful in determining the etiological role of another medical condition.

**Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder**:
- Intoxication with central nervous system stimulants (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine) or cannabis and withdrawal from central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates) can precipitate a panic attack.
- Features suggestive of substance use: Onset after age 45 years or the presence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo, loss of consciousness, loss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech, or amnesia).

**Panic Disorder**:
- Repeated unexpected panic attacks are required but are not sufficient for the diagnosis of panic disorder (i.e., full diagnostic criteria must be met).

**Comorbidities:**
- Panic attacks are associated with increased likelihood of various comorbid mental disorders, including:
  - Anxiety disorders
  - Depressive disorders
  - Bipolar disorders
  - Impulse control disorders
  - Substance use disorders.
- Panic attacks are also associated with an increased risk of later developing anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, and possibly other disorders.

#### Agoraphobia

**Agoraphobia Diagnostic Criteria (F40.00)**

**Criteria A-G**:
- **Agoraphobia**: marked fear or anxiety about two or more of the following five situations:
  - Using public transportation
  - Being in open spaces
  - Being in enclosed places
  - Standing in line or being in a crowd
  - Being outside the home alone
- **B.** Individual fears these situations due to thoughts that escape might be difficult or help might not be available in case of panic symptoms
- **C.** Agoraphobic situations provoke fear or anxiety nearly every time they are encountered
- **D.** Individuals actively avoid, require a companion, or endure with intense fear/anxiety
- **E.** Fear is out of proportion to actual danger and sociocultural context
- **F.** Persistent for 6 months or more
- **G.** Causes clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning
- **H. if another medical condition, excess fear is not better explained by symptoms of another disorder**

**Note**: Agoraphobia diagnosed regardless of panic disorder presence; both diagnoses assigned if applicable.

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Essential feature: marked fear/anxiety triggered by agoraphobic situations (A)
- Fear or anxiety evoked by specific situations, varies with proximity and presence (C)
- Avoidance or intense fear/anxiety when encountering these situations (D)
- Proportion to danger and sociocultural context is important for differentiation (E)
- Persistent and causing significant distress or impairment in functioning (F, G)

**Associated Features:**
- Severe cases may lead to complete homeboundness and dependence on others (Demoralization, depressive symptoms, alcohol/sedative abuse possible)

###### "Prevalence and Characteristics of Agoraphobia in Different Age Groups"

**Prevalence:**
- Approximately 1.7% of adolescents and adults have a diagnosis of agoraphobia annually
- Females twice as likely as males to experience agoraphobia
- Incidence peaks in late adolescence and early adulthood, with a 12-month prevalence of 0.4% for individuals over 65 years old
- Prevalence rates do not vary systematically across cultural/racial groups

**Development and Course:**
- Percentage of agoraphobia patients reporting panic attacks or panic disorder preceding onset ranges from 30% to over 50%
- Majority of individuals with panic disorder show signs of anxiety and agoraphobia before onset
- Initial onset often occurs before age 35, with a high incidence risk in late adolescence and early adulthood
- Overall mean age at onset is 17 years without preceding panic attacks or panic disorder (25-29 years)
- Course typically persistent and chronic, complete remission rare (10%) unless treated
- Complications include other anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, substance use disorders, and personality disorders
- Long-term course associated with increased risk of secondary major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), and substance use disorders
- Clinical features consistent across the lifespan, but fear/avoidance situations and cognitions may vary depending on age

**Risk Factors:**
- Temperamental: behavioral inhibition, neurotic disposition (negative affectivity [neuroticism], anxiety sensitivity)
- Environmental: negative childhood events, stressful events, reduced warmth, increased overprotection in family climate
- Genetic and physiological: heritability for agoraphobia is 61%, strongest association with proneness to phobias

**Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues:**
- Females have different comorbid disorder patterns than males
- Males have higher rates of comorbid substance use disorders

**Functional Consequences of Agoraphobia:**
- Significant impairment and disability in role functioning, work productivity, and disability days
- Degree of disability strongly determined by agoraphobia severity regardless of comorbid conditions.

###### Differentiating Agoraphobia from Other Anxiety Disorders

**Differential Diagnosis of Agoraphobia**
- When diagnostic criteria for **agoraphobia** and another disorder are fully met, both diagnoses should be assigned, unless the fear, anxiety, or avoidance of agoraphobia is attributable to the other disorder.
- Weighting of criteria and clinical judgment may be helpful in some cases.

**Specific Phobia, Situational Type:**
- Differentiating agoraphobia from situational specific phobia can be challenging due to shared symptom characteristics.
- Specific phobia, situational type, should be diagnosed vs. agoraphobia if the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is limited to one of the agoraphobic situations.
- Requiring fears from two or more agoraphobic situations is a robust means for differentiating agoraphobia from specific phobias, particularly the situational subtype.
- Additional differentiating features include cognitive ideation:
  - If the situation is feared for reasons other than panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms (e.g., fears of being directly harmed by the situation itself), then a diagnosis of specific phobia may be more appropriate.

**Separation Anxiety Disorder:**
- Separation anxiety disorder can be differentiated from agoraphobia by examining cognitive ideation:
  - In separation anxiety disorder, thoughts are about detachment from significant others and the home environment (i.e., parents or other attachment figures), whereas in agoraphobia the focus is on panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms in the feared situations.

**Social Anxiety Disorder:**
- Agoraphobia should be differentiated from social anxiety disorder based primarily on the situational clusters that trigger fear, anxiety, or avoidance and the cognitive ideation:
  - In social anxiety disorder, the focus is on fear of being negatively evaluated.
  - Panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms should be present in agoraphobia but not in social anxiety disorder.

**Panic Disorder:**
- When criteria for panic disorder are met, agoraphobia should not be diagnosed if the avoidance behaviors associated with the panic attacks do not extend to avoidance of two or more agoraphobic situations.

**Acute Stress Disorder and PTSD:**
- Acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be differentiated from agoraphobia by examining whether the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is related only to situations that remind the individual of a traumatic event:
  - If the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is restricted to trauma reminders and does not extend to two or more agoraphobic situations, then a diagnosis of agoraphobia is not warranted.

**Major Depressive Disorder:**
- In major depressive disorder, the individual may avoid leaving home due to apathy, loss of energy, low self-esteem, and anhedonia.
- If the avoidance is unrelated to fears of panic-like or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms, then agoraphobia should not be diagnosed.

**Other Medical Conditions:**
- Agoraphobia is not diagnosed if the avoidance of situations is judged to be a physiological consequence of a medical condition:
  - This determination is based on history, laboratory findings, and a physical examination.
  - Other relevant medical conditions may include neurodegenerative disorders with associated motor disturbances (e.g., Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis), as well as cardiovascular disorders.
  - Individuals with certain medical conditions may avoid situations due to realistic concerns about being incapacitated or embarrassed.
- The diagnosis of agoraphobia should be given only when the fear or avoidance is clearly in excess of that usually associated with these medical conditions.

**Comorbidity:**
- The majority of individuals with agoraphobia also have other mental disorders:
  - The most frequent additional diagnoses are other anxiety disorders (e.g., separation anxiety disorder, specific phobias, panic disorder), depressive disorders (major depressive disorder), PTSD, and alcohol use disorder.
- While other anxiety disorders frequently precede the onset of agoraphobia, depressive disorders and substance use disorders typically occur secondary to agoraphobia.

#### Generalized Anxiety Disorder

**Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) about multiple events or activities for at least 6 months
- Difficulty controlling the worry
- At least three of the following symptoms:
  - Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
  - Being easily fatigued
  - Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
  - Irritability
  - Muscle tension
  - Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, restless sleep)
- Anxiety causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational functioning
- Not attributable to substance use, medical condition, or another mental disorder

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Excessive anxiety and worry about everyday, routine life circumstances
- Worry interferes significantly with psychosocial functioning
- Worry is more pervasive, pronounced, and distressing; has longer duration; frequently occurs without precipitants
- Greater range of life circumstances worried about = more likely to meet criteria for GAD
- Distinction from nonpathological anxiety: excessive worry interferes with functioning, and accompanied by additional symptoms (restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance)

**Associated Features:**
- Muscle tension may lead to trembling, twitching, feeling shaky, muscle aches or soreness
- Somatic symptoms: sweating, nausea, diarrhea
- Exaggerated startle response
- Autonomic hyperarousal symptoms (e.g., accelerated heart rate, shortness of breath, dizziness) less prominent than other anxiety disorders

###### Prevalence, Diagnosis, and Impact of Generalized Anxiety Disorder

**Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**

**Prevalence**:
- 12-month prevalence: 0.9% among adolescents, 2.9% among adults in the US
- Lifetime morbid risk: 9.0%
- More common in females than males (twice as likely)
- Peaks in middle age, declines with age
- More frequent in individuals of European descent compared to non-Europeans

**Development and Course**:
- Onset rarely occurs before adolescence
- Symptoms chronic, wax and wane over lifespan
- Content of worry changes with age (e.g., children focus on school performance)
- Earlier symptoms correlate with more comorbidity and impairment

**Risk Factors**:
- **Temperamental**: Behavioral inhibition, negative affectivity (neuroticism), harm avoidance
- **Environmental**: Childhood adversities, parental overprotection
- **Genetic and physiological**: One-third of risk is genetic, overlaps with neuroticism and other anxiety/mood disorders

**Cultural Variation**:
- Expression varies by culture (somatic vs. cognitive symptoms)
- Social context important in evaluating excessive worrying

**Gender Differences**:
- More common in females than males (approximately 55%-60%)
- Similar symptoms but different comorbidity patterns

**Functional Consequences**:
- Impairs ability to perform tasks quickly and efficiently
- Significant disability and distress independent of comorbid disorders
- Accounts for 110 million disability days per year in the U.S. population

###### Diagnosing Anxiety Disorders: A Comprehensive Guide

**Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition:**
- Diagnosis assigned when anxiety is a physiological effect of another medical condition (e.g., pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism)

**Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder:**
- Distinguished from generalized anxiety disorder by the fact that a substance or medication (e.g., drug of abuse, toxin exposure) is etiologically related to the anxiety

**Social Anxiety Disorder:**
- Individuals have anticipatory anxiety focused on social situations where they must perform or be evaluated by others
- Differentiated from generalized anxiety disorder by type and context of worry

**Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):**
- Excessive worry focuses on future problems in generalized anxiety disorder, whereas OCD has intrusive and unwanted thoughts, urges, or images that are inappropriate

**Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Adjustment Disorders:**
- Anxiety is present in PTSD; not diagnosed if better explained by symptoms of PTSD or if anxiety occurs after an identifiable stressor for less than 6 months
- In adjustment disorders, anxiety occurs within 3 months of the stressor and does not persist beyond its termination or consequences

**Depressive Disorders:**
- Generalized anxiety disorder is a common associated feature of depressive disorders; excessive worry should not be diagnosed separately if it only occurred during these conditions

**Comorbidity:**
- Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder are likely to have met criteria for other anxiety and unipolar depressive disorders
- Comorbidity with substance use, conduct, psychotic, neurodevelopmental, and neurocognitive disorders is less common.

#### Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder

**Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder**

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
1. **Panic attacks or anxiety**: predominant clinical picture
2. History, physical examination, or laboratory findings of:
   - Symptoms developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal
   - Exposure to medication causing symptoms
3. The disturbance is not better explained by an independent anxiety disorder
4. **No occurrence exclusively during delirium**
5. Causes clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning
6. Diagnosis should be made instead of substance intoxication or withdrawal only when symptoms predominate and are severe enough for clinical attention
7. **Coding Note:** Use ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes from the table provided, based on substance class and comorbid substance use disorder (if any)

**Recording Procedures:**
- Name of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder: begins with specific substance, followed by specification of onset
  - With onset during intoxication
  - With onset during withdrawal
  - With onset after medication use
- ICD-9-CM: separate diagnostic code for substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder (if any)
- ICD-10-CM: combine substance-induced disorder and comorbid substance use disorder into a single code.

###### Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder: Causes and Diagnostic Features

**Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder**

**Essential Features:**
- Prominent symptoms of panic or anxiety (Criterion A) due to substance use or medication
- Symptoms develop during or soon after substance intoxication, withdrawal, or exposure to medication (Criterion B2)
- Onset of symptoms while receiving prescribed treatment for mental disorder or other medical condition
- Improvement of symptoms once treatment is discontinued, usually within days to several weeks
- Not given if onset of symptoms precedes substance/medication intoxication or withdrawal, or if they persist for more than a month

**Substances/Medications:**
- Intoxication: alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, phencyclidine, hallucinogens, inhalants, stimulants (including cocaine), and other substances
- Withdrawal: alcohol; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine); and other substances
- Medications: anesthetics and analgesics, sympathomimetics or other bronchodilators, anticholinergics, insulin, thyroid preparations, oral contraceptives, antihistamines, antiparkinsonian medications, corticosteroids, antihypertensive and cardiovascular medications, anticonvulsants, lithium carbonate, antipsychotic medications, and antidepressant medications
- Heavy metals and toxins: organophosphate insecticide, nerve gases, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, volatile substances such as gasoline and paint.

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- Symptoms of panic or anxiety are predominant in clinical picture
- Severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention.

###### Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder: Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis

**Prevalence of Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder:**
- General population: approximately 0.002% (12-month prevalence)
- Clinical populations: higher than general population, diagnosis is likely

**Laboratory Assessments:**
- Useful to measure substance intoxication as part of assessment
- Urine toxicology, physical examination, or laboratory findings for evidence

**Differential Diagnosis:**
1. **Substance Intoxication and Withdrawal:**
   - Anxiety symptoms common in both conditions
   - Diagnosis of substance specific intoxication or withdrawal sufficient
2. **Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder vs. Primary Anxiety Disorder:**
   - Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder: arises only during intoxication or withdrawal states
   - Primary anxiety disorders: persist for a substantial period after substance use ends
   - Features suggesting substance/medication etiology: atypical age at onset, symptoms (e.g., vertigo, loss of bladder control)
3. **Delirium:**
   - If panic or anxiety symptoms occur exclusively during delirium, considered an associated feature and not diagnosed separately
4. **Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition:**
   - If symptoms attributed to another medical condition rather than medication taken for it, diagnosis is anxiety disorder due to another medical condition
5. **Insufficient Evidence:**
   - When evidence insufficient to determine etiology (substance/medication or another medical condition), diagnose with other specified or unspecified anxiety disorder.

#### Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition

**Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (F06.4)**

**Criteria**:
- **A. Panic attacks or anxiety is predominant in the clinical picture.**
- **B. There is evidence from history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.**
- **C. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.**
- **D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.**
- **E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.**

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Clinically significant anxiety best explained as a physiological effect of another medical condition
- Symptoms include prominent anxiety symptoms or panic attacks
- Judgment that symptoms are best explained by the associated physical condition based on historical, physical, or laboratory evidence
- Anxiety not better accounted for by another mental disorder, especially adjustment disorder with anxiety
- Careful assessment of temporal association, atypical features, and literature supporting physiological mechanism

**Associated Features**:
- Medical conditions known to include anxiety as a symptomatic manifestation (e.g., endocrine disorders, cardiovascular disorders, respiratory illnesses, metabolic disturbances, neurological illness)
- Anxiety due to another medical condition diagnosed when the medical condition is known to induce anxiety and preceded the onset of anxiety.

###### Anxiety Disorders Associated with Medical Conditions: Diagnosis and Markers

**Prevalence:**
- Unclear prevalence of anxiety disorders related to another medical condition
- Elevated prevalence found among individuals with asthma, hypertension, ulcers, arthritis, etc.
- Increased prevalence may be due to reasons other than anxiety causing the medical condition

**Development and Course:**
- Development follows course of underlying illness
- Not meant for primary anxiety disorders that arise in chronic medical contexts
- Important consideration for older adults with chronic medical conditions and secondary anxiety disorders.

**Diagnostic Markers:**
- Laboratory assessments and/or medical examinations required to confirm associated medical condition diagnosis.

###### Diagnosis of Anxiety Disorders: Medical and Substance Causes

**Differential Diagnosis of Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition:**
* **Delirium**: If anxiety disturbance occurs exclusively during delirium, no separate diagnosis of anxiety disorder is given. However, an additional diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) with anxiety may be given if anxiety is a prominent part of the clinical presentation and etiology is a physiological consequence of the neurological disorder.
* **Mixed Presentation of Symptoms**: If there are mixed symptoms (e.g., mood and anxiety), the specific mental disorder depends on which symptoms predominantly occur in the clinical picture.
* **Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder**: Consider this diagnosis when there is evidence of recent or prolonged substance use, withdrawal from a substance, or exposure to a toxin. Difficulty distinguishing anxiety from medications or medical illness may require lab evaluations and thorough assessment. Symptoms occurring during/after substance intoxication or withdrawal are indicative of a substance/medication-induced disorder.
* **Anxiety Disorder (Not Due to Known Medical Condition)**: Distinguish this diagnosis from other anxiety disorders, especially panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, by demonstrating specific physiological mechanisms associated with another medical condition. Late age at onset, atypical symptoms during a panic attack, and absence of personal/family history may suggest the need for further assessment. Anxiety disorders can exacerbate or pose risks to medical conditions but should not be diagnosed as anxiety disorder due to another medical condition in those cases.
* **Illness Anxiety Disorder**: This diagnosis is characterized by worry about illness, concern about pain, and bodily preoccupations without physiological symptoms related to anxiety. Illness anxiety disorder is distinct from anxiety disorder due to another medical condition as there is no direct physical link between the anxiety symptoms and another medical condition.
* **Adjustment Disorders**: Anxiety symptoms in adjustment disorders are maladaptive responses to stress about having a general medical condition, while anxiety disorder due to another medical condition involves prominent physical symptoms and focusing on issues other than stress. Associated features of another mental disorder should also be considered when making the diagnosis.
* **Other Specified or Unspecified Anxiety Disorder**: Given when it cannot be determined whether the anxiety symptoms are primary, substance-induced, or associated with another medical condition.

#### Other Specified Anxiety Disorder 300.09

**Anxiety Disorders: Other Specified and Unspecified Anxiety Disorders**

**Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (300.09, F41 .8)**
- Applies to presentations with anxiety symptoms causing clinically significant distress or impairment but not meeting criteria for specific disorders
- Used when communicating specific reasons why the presentation does not meet criteria for a specific anxiety disorder:
  - **Limited-symptom attacks**
  - **Generalized anxiety not occurring more days than not**
  - **Khyal cap (wind attacks)**: See "Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress" in Appendix
  - **Ataque de nervios (attack of nerves)**: See "Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress" in Appendix

**Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (300.00, F41 .9)**
- Applies to presentations with anxiety symptoms causing clinically significant distress or impairment but not meeting criteria for any anxiety disorder
- Used when the clinician chooses not to specify the reason why the criteria are not met for a specific anxiety disorder, including:
  - Presentations with insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings)

### Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

**Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders**

**OBSSESIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD):**
- Characterized by the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions
- Obsessions: recurrent, persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced as intrusive and unwanted
- Compulsions: repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an individual feels driven to perform in response to obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly
- Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders also have preoccupations and repetitive behaviors/mental acts
- Distinction from developmentally normal preoccupations and rituals: excessive or persisting beyond developmentally appropriate periods
- Symptom dimensions: cleaning, symmetry, forbidden or taboo thoughts, harm
- Tic-related specifier used when individual has current or past history of a tic disorder

**BODY DYSMORPHIC DISORDER:**
- Preoccupation with perceived defects/flaws in physical appearance not observable to others
- Repetitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming) or mental acts (comparing appearance) in response to appearance concerns
- Distinct from body fat or weight concerns in eating disorders
- Muscle dysmorphia: belief one's body is too small or insufficiently muscular

**HOARDING DISORDER:**
- Persistent difficulty discarding possessions, regardless of their actual value
- Strong perceived need to save items and distress associated with discarding them
- Hoarding differs from normal collecting: accumulation of a large number of possessions that congest active living areas, compromising intended use

**TRICHOTILLOMANIA (HAIR-PULLING DISORDER) AND EXCORIATION (SKIN-PICKING):**
- Recurrent body-focused repetitive behaviors without triggers by obsessions or preoccupations
- Variable degrees of conscious awareness while engaging in behavior
- Substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder: symptoms due to substance intoxication, withdrawal, or medication
- Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition: symptoms caused by a medical disorder

**OTHER SPECIFIED OR UNSPECIFIED OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE AND RELATED DISORDER:**
- Symptoms that do not meet criteria for specific obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to atypical presentation or uncertain etiology
- Examples: body-focused repetitive behavior disorder, obsessional jealousy

**INSIGHT SPECIFIERS:**
- Obsessive-compulsive disorders with cognitive component have insight specifiers based on individual's level of awareness and belief in disorder-related symptoms.

#### Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

**Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- A. Presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both:
  * Obsessions: recurrent and persistent thoughts causing anxiety or distress
    - Intrusive and unwanted
    - Attempted to ignore or suppress
  * Compulsions: repetitive behaviors or mental acts aimed at reducing anxiety or distress
    - Not connected in a realistic way with what they're designed to neutralize
    - Excessive
- B. Time-consuming (more than 1 hour per day) or cause clinically significant distress/impairment
- C. Not attributable to substance use or another mental disorder

**Insight:**
- Good or fair: recognizes beliefs are not true or may not be
- Poor: thinks beliefs are probably true
- Absent insight/delusional: completely convinced beliefs are true

**Tic Disorder**: up to 30% have a lifetime history of tic disorder, most common in males with childhood onset OCD

**Themes:** cleaning (contamination obsessions and cleaning compulsions), symmetry, forbidden or taboo thoughts, harm

**Associated Features:** marked anxiety, distressing sense of "incompleteness," avoidance of triggers.

###### OCD Prevalence, Risk Factors, Symptoms, and Impact on Quality of Life

**Prevalence**
- OCD prevalence: 1.2% (US), 1.1%-1.8% internationally
- Females slightly more affected than males in adulthood; males more commonly affected children
- Mean age at onset: 19.5 years, 25% by age 14
- Gradual onset with some acute cases
- Chronic course if untreated, low remission rates (e.g., 20%)
- Childhood/adolescent onset may lead to lifetime OCD but can also result in remission for some

**Development and Course**
- Temperamental risk factors: internalizing symptoms, negative emotionality, behavioral inhibition
- Environmental risks: physical/sexual abuse, stressful events
- Genetic and physiological transmission: increased rate among first-degree relatives; dysfunction in orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, striatum

**Comorbidities**
- Co-occurrence of other disorders (see "Comorbidity" section)
- Children diagnosed with both obsessions and compulsions
- Content differences between children/adolescents vs. adults: more sexual/religious obsessions in adolescents, higher rates of harm obsessions in children

**Risk Factors**
- Temperamental: internalizing symptoms, negative emotionality, behavioral inhibition in childhood
- Environmental: physical/sexual abuse, stressful events
- Genetic and physiological: increased rate among first-degree relatives, dysfunction in orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, striatum

**Cultural Issues**
- OCD occurs worldwide with similar gender distribution, age at onset, and comorbidity
- Regional variation in symptom expression
- Cultural factors shape content of obsessions and compulsions

**Gender Differences**
- Males: earlier age at onset, more likely to have comorbid tic disorders
- Gender differences in symptom dimensions: females more likely cleaning, males forbidden thoughts/symmetry
- Peripartum period onset or exacerbation of OCD can impact mother-infant relationship

**Suicide Risk**
- Up to half have suicidal thoughts
- One-quarter attempt suicide; comorbid major depressive disorder increases risk

**Functional Consequences of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**
- Reduced quality of life, high levels of social and occupational impairment
- Impairment across various domains: time spent on obsessions/compulsions, avoidance, specific symptom effects (e.g., relationships, projects)
- Health consequences: avoidance of doctors' offices/hospitals, dermatological problems, interference with treatment
- Developmental difficulties for childhood/adolescent onset individuals: few significant relationships outside family, lack of autonomy and financial independence.

###### Distinguishing Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) from Related Conditions

**Differential Diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**

**Anxiety Disorders vs. OCD:**
- Recurrent thoughts, avoidant behaviors, and repetitive requests for reassurance can occur in anxiety disorders
- Obsessions in **generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)** are about real-life concerns
- Obsessions of **OCD** often do not involve real-life concerns and can include odd, irrational, or magical content
- Compulsions are present only in OCD and linked to obsessions

**Major Depressive Disorder vs. OCD:**
- Ruminations in major depressive disorder are mood-congruent and not necessarily intrusive or distressing
- Obsessions and compulsions in OCD are not linked to depression

**Other Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders:**
- **Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)** has obsessions and compulsions limited to concerns about physical appearance
- **Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder)** has compulsive behavior without obsessions
- Hoarding symptoms focus exclusively on difficulty discarding items, distress associated with disposal, and excessive accumulation of objects
- If OCD symptoms lead to hoarding behaviors, OCD diagnosis should be given instead

**Eating Disorders:**
- OCD is not limited to concerns about weight or food

**Tics (in tic disorder) vs. Stereotyped Movements:**
- Tics are sudden, rapid, recurrent nonrhythmic motor movements or vocalizations
- Stereotyped movements are repetitive, seemingly driven nonfunctional motor behaviors
- Compulsions precede obsessions in OCD, while tics are often preceded by premonitory sensory urges
- If both OCD and tic disorder are present, both diagnoses can be given

**Psychotic Disorders:**
- Individuals with poor insight or delusional beliefs about OCD but no other psychosis symptoms should not be diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder

**Comorbidities of OCD:**
- **Anxiety disorders (76%), depressive or bipolar disorders (63%, mainly major depressive disorder), and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (23-32%) are common comorbidities**
- **Tic disorder (up to 30%)** is more common in males with childhood onset of OCD
- Association between OCD, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and impulse control disorders like oppositional defiant disorder
- Elevated prevalence of OCD in schizophrenia (approximately 12%), bipolar disorder, eating disorders, and Tourette's disorder

**Comorbidities vs. Associations:**
- Comorbid conditions occur more frequently in individuals with OCD than expected based on population prevalence
- Conditions associated with OCD have an elevated prevalence among those diagnosed with the disorder compared to the general population.

#### Body Dysmorphic Disorder

**Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD)**
- **Criteria for Diagnosis**:
  - **Preoccupation with perceived defects/flaws**: Not observable or appear slight to others
  - **Repetitive behaviors/mental acts**: In response to appearance concerns, causing distress and impairment in functioning
  - **No better explained by body fat or weight issues**: Indicates an eating disorder is not present
- **Specifiers**:
  - With muscle dysmorphia: Preoccupied with perceived insufficient muscularity
  - Indicate degree of insight into the disorder and its beliefs
- **Diagnostic Features**:
  - Preoccupation with perceived defects or flaws in appearance
  - Intrusive, unwanted, time-consuming preoccupations
  - Excessive repetitive behaviors or mental acts to alleviate concerns
  - Difficulty resisting or controlling the behaviors
  - Common behaviors: Comparing appearance, mirror checking, excessive grooming, camouflaging, reassurance seeking
- **Differentiation from Eating Disorders**: Muscle dysmorphia is a form of BDD occurring in males with normal or exaggerated muscularity
- **Insight and Associated Features**:
  - Insight can range from good to absent/delusional
  - Individuals may have ideas or delusions of reference, high anxiety, social anxiety, depressed mood, neuroticism, perfectionism, low extroversion, and low self-esteem
  - Many receive cosmetic treatments, but the disorder tends to worsen over time despite treatment
- **Associated Features**: Executive dysfunction, visual processing abnormalities, negative interpretation of facial expressions and ambiguous scenarios.

###### Prevalence, Risk Factors, & Impact on Functioning

**Prevalence**
- Mean age at disorder onset: 16-17 years
- Median age at onset: 15 years
- Most common age at onset: 12-13 years
- **Two-thirds of individuals** have onset before age 18

**Subclinical Symptoms**
- Begin, on average, at age 12 or 13 years
- Gradual onset for most
- Improvement with evidence-based treatment

**Clinical Features**
- Similarities in children / adolescents and adults
- Occurs in elderly, but little known about it

**Risk Factors**
- High rates of childhood neglect and abuse
- Elevated prevalence in first-degree relatives of OCD individuals
- Cultural values may influence symptom content

**Gender Differences**
- Females and males have more similarities than differences
- Males: genital preoccupations
- Females: comorbid eating disorders
- Muscle dysmorphia in males only

**Suicide Risk**
- High rates of suicidal ideation and attempts
- Substantial proportion attribute to appearance concerns
- Many risk factors for completed suicide

**Functional Consequences**
- Impaired psychosocial functioning due to appearance concerns
- Range from moderate to extreme impairment
- Job, academic or role functioning often severely affected.

###### Diagnosing Body Dysmorphic Disorder: A Comparative Approach

**Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD)**

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Nonobvious appearance concerns: not diagnosed as BDD
- Observable physical defects: can cause skin lesions and scarring in some cases

**Eating Disorders**:
- Concerns about being fat are a symptom of eating disorder, not BDD
- Weight concerns may occur in BDD
- Comorbidity is common

**Other Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders**:
- Preoccupations and repetitive behaviors differ from obsessions and compulsions in OCD
- Poor insight in BDD
- Skin picking intended to improve appearance: BDD diagnosis
- Hair removal intended to improve appearance: BDD diagnosis

**Illness Anxiety Disorder (IAD)**:
- Individuals with BDD are not preoccupied with having or acquiring a serious illness
- No elevated somatization levels

**Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**:
- Prominent appearance preoccupation and repetitive behaviors in BDD differentiate it from MDD
- Depression common, often secondary to distress and impairment caused by BDD

**Anxiety Disorders**:
- Social anxiety and avoidance common in BDD
- Agoraphobia, avoidant personality disorder: no delusional beliefs or repetitive behaviors as in BDD
- Focus on perceived appearance flaws, not generalized anxiety

**Psychotic Disorders**:
- Delusional appearance beliefs: diagnosed as body dysmorphic disorder with absent insight
- No disorganized behavior or other psychotic symptoms, except for delusional beliefs about appearance

**Other Disorders and Symptoms**:
- Not diagnosed if preoccupation is limited to discomfort with primary/secondary sex characteristics in gender dysphoria
- Olfactory reference syndrome: not a DSM-5 disorder
- Koro: focus on death, no obsession with perceived ugliness as in BDD
- Dysmorphic concern: broader construct than BDD, not equivalent to it.

**Comorbidity**:
- Major depressive disorder most common comorbid condition
- Social anxiety disorder (social phobia), OCD, substance-related disorders also common

#### Hoarding Disorder

**Hoarding Disorder (Diagnostic Criteria)**
- **Persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions**: regardless of their actual value (Criterion A)
- This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and distress associated with discarding them
- The difficulty results in accumulation of possessions that congest active living areas, compromising their use (Criterion C)
- Hoarding causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion D)
- Not attributable to another medical condition or better explained by symptoms of another mental disorder (Criteria E and F)

**Specific Features**
- **Excessive acquisition**: if difficulty discarding possessions is accompanied by excesse acquisition of items not needed or for which there is no space (Specifier)
- **Good, fair, or poor insight**: individual's perception of problematic hoarding behaviors (Specifier)
- Hoarding with excessive acquisition: most common form, including buying and acquiring free items (Specifier)
- Distress if unable to acquire items, often go to great lengths to avoid being wasteful

**Diagnostic Features**
- Individuals save a variety of items, not limited to those defined as useless or of limited value
- Saving possessions is intentional and produces distress when facing discarding them
- Cluttered active living areas, impairing their intended use
- Contrasts with normative collecting behavior, which is organized and systematic
- Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion D)
- Common features: indecisiveness, perfectionism, avoidance, procrastination, difficulty planning and organizing tasks, and distractibility. Some live in unsanitary conditions or have animals hoarding issues. Animal hoarding can be a manifestation of hoarding disorder.

###### Hoarding Disorder: Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Impact on Quality of Life

**Prevalence**
- No nationally representative prevalence studies available for hoarding disorder
- Community surveys estimate:
  - Approximately 2%-6% of the population in the United States and Europe
  - Greater prevalence among males than females (contrasts with clinical samples)
- More prevalent in older adults (ages 55-94 years) compared to younger adults (ages 34-44 years)

**Development and Course**
- Hoarding symptoms begin early in life
- May emerge around ages 11-15, start interfering with daily functioning by mid-20s
- Cause clinically significant impairment by mid-30s
- Severity increases with each decade of life
- Chronic course with few individuals reporting waxing and waning symptoms
- Pathological hoarding in children easily distinguished from adaptive saving and collecting behaviors
  - Intervention of third parties (e.g., parents) should be considered for diagnosis due to children's lack of control over their environment

**Risk Factors**
- **Temperamental**: Indecisiveness is a common trait among individuals with hoarding disorder and their relatives
- **Environmental**: Stressful or traumatic life events preceding onset or exacerbation of hoarding
- **Genetic and Physiological**: Hoarding behavior has familial prevalence, approximately 50% of those who hoard report having a relative who does as well
- Twin studies suggest that half of the variability in hoarding is due to genetic factors

**Diagnostic Issues**
- Research mostly done on Western, industrialized countries and urban communities
- Available data from non-Western and developing countries suggests hoarding is a universal phenomenon with consistent clinical features
- Gender-related issues: Comparable key features of hoarding disorder in males and females, but females display more excessive buying than males
- Functional consequences: Impairs basic activities, quality of life, and health; associated with occupational impairment, poor physical health, high social service utilization, strained family relationships, conflict with neighbors, and legal eviction proceedings.

###### Diagnostic Exclusions and Comorbidities in Hoarding Disorder

**Differential Diagnosis for Hoarding Disorder**

**Medical Conditions:**
- **Hoarding disorder not diagnosed if symptoms are a direct consequence of another medical condition (Criterion E)**
  - Traumatic brain injury
  - Surgical resection for treatment of a tumor or seizure control
  - Cerebrovascular disease
  - Infections of the central nervous system (e.g., herpes simplex encephalitis)
  - Neurogenetic conditions such as Prader-Willi syndrome
  - Damage to anterior ventromedial prefrontal and cingulate cortices associated with excessive accumulation of objects
  - Individuals may not be interested in or care about the accumulated items
- **Hoarding behavior not present prior to onset of brain damage**

**Neurodevelopmental Disorders:**
- **Hoarding disorder not diagnosed if accumulation is a direct consequence of neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability)**
- Individuals with hoarding disorder may have little interest or inability to discard items

**Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders:**
- **Hoarding disorder not diagnosed if accumulation is a direct consequence of delusions or negative symptoms in these disorders**

**Major Depressive Episode:**
- **Hoarding disorder not diagnosed if accumulation is a result of psychomotor retardation, fatigue, or loss of energy during a major depressive episode**

**Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):**
- **Hoarding disorder not diagnosed if symptoms are a direct consequence of typical obsessions or compulsions in OCD (e.g., fears of contamination, harm, or feelings of incompleteness)**
  - Accumulation of bizarre items is very unusual in hoarding disorder compared to OCD
- Feelings of incompleteness are the most frequent OCD symptoms associated with this form of hoarding
- Excessive acquisition is usually not present; if it is, it's due to a specific obsession (e.g., need to buy items)

**Neurocognitive Disorders:**
- **Hoarding disorder not diagnosed if accumulation is a direct consequence of degenerative neurocognitive disorders**
  - Onset of hoarding behavior gradual and follows onset of neurocognitive disorder
  - Accumulating behavior may be accompanied by self-neglect, severe domestic squalor, and other neuropsychiatric symptoms (disinhibition, gambling, rituals/stereotypies, tics, and self-injurious behaviors)

**Comorbid Conditions:**
- Approximately 75% of individuals with hoarding disorder have a comorbid mood or anxiety disorder
  - Major depressive disorder (up to 50%)
  - Social anxiety disorder (social phobia)
  - Generalized anxiety disorder
- Comorbidities may be the main reason for consultation and not asked about in routine clinical interviews.

#### Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)

**Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)**

**Criteria for Diagnosis:**
- Recurrent pulling out of one's hair (Criterion A)
  * Common sites: scalp, eyebrows, eyelids, axillary, facial, pubic, peri-rectal regions
  * Variable patterns and durations
  - Hair loss may not be visible or camouflaged
- Repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling (Criterion B)
- Clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational functioning (Criterion C)
- Not attributable to another medical condition
- Not better explained by symptoms of another mental disorder

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Recurrent hair pulling from various body sites
  * Scalp: alopecia, thinning, or "tonsure trichotillomania" (complete baldness except for a narrow perimeter)
  * Eyebrows and eyelashes may be absent
- Behaviors or rituals involving hair
  * Searching for specific hairs
  * Pulling out hair in a particular way
  * Manipulating or consuming pulled hair
- Emotional states before/during/after hair pulling
  * Anxiety, boredom, tension, relief
- Varying degrees of conscious awareness

**Supporting Features:**
- Painless hair loss
- Variable patterns and severity of hair loss
- Other body-focused repetitive behaviors: skin picking, nail biting, lip chewing

**Prevalence:**
- General population: 1%-2% (adults and adolescents)
- Females more frequently affected than males (approximately 10:1)
- Reflects true gender ratio or differential treatment seeking based on gender or cultural attitudes.

###### Development and Course

**Trichotillomania: Development, Course, Risk Factors, Functional Consequences, Differential Diagnosis**

**Development and Course:**
- Hair pulling observed in infants; resolves during early development
- Onset often coincides with or follows puberty
- Chronic disorder with waxing and waning symptoms if untreated
- Symptoms may worsen in females with hormonal changes
- Some individuals remit without relapse within a few years of onset

**Risk Factors:**
- Genetic vulnerability indicated by higher incidence among individuals with OCD and their relatives
- Evidence for genetic predisposition

**Functional Consequences:**
- Distress and social/occupational impairment
- Irreversible damage to hair growth and quality
- Rare medical consequences: digit purpura, musculoskeletal injury, blepharitis, dental damage
- Swallowing of hair (trichophagia) may lead to trichobezoars and related complications

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Normal hair removal for cosmetic purposes
- Symmetry rituals in OCD or body dysmorphic disorder
- Body-focused repetitive behavior disorder
- Stereotypies in neurodevelopmental disorders
- Tics in tic disorders
- Delusions/hallucinations in psychotic disorders
- Other medical conditions causing alopecia (scarring or non-scarring)

**Comorbidities:**
- Major depressive disorder and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder are common companions.
- Repetitive body-focused symptoms other than hair pulling may deserve an additional diagnosis of other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (body-focused repetitive behavior disorder).

#### Excoriation {Skin-Picking) Disorder

**Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **Recurrent skin picking resulting in skin lesions (Criterion A)**
  - Picking at various body sites, including face, arms, and hands
  - Healthy skin or minor irregularities may be picked
  - Use of fingernails, tweezers, pins, or other objects
  - Skin rubbing, squeezing, lancing, and biting also common
  - Individuals spend significant time on picking behavior, sometimes several hours daily
- **Repeated attempts to decrease or stop skin picking (Criterion B)**
- **Skin picking causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C)**
  - Negative affects include loss of control, embarrassment, and shame
  - Avoidance of social situations due to impairment

**Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis**:
- Behaviors or rituals involving skin or scabs
  - Searching for particular scab to pull
  - Examining, playing with, or mouthing/swallowing picked skin
- Skin picking may be preceded by tension and accompanied by relief
- May occur in response to minor skin irregularities or uncomfortable bodily sensation
- Pain is not routinely reported
- Can occur automatically without full awareness
- Usually does not occur in presence of other individuals except immediate family members
- Some individuals report picking the skin of others.

###### "Excoriation Disorder: Prevalence, Features, and Complications"

**Prevalence of Excoriation Disorder:**
- Lifetime prevalence in adults: 1.4% or higher
- Females make up three-quarters or more of cases
- Reflects true gender ratio, but may also be due to differential treatment seeking and cultural attitudes

**Development and Course:**
- Skin picking often starts during adolescence, coinciding with puberty
- Onset may follow dermatological condition like acne
- Sites vary over time; chronic course with waxing and waning if untreated
- Disorder comes and goes for some individuals for weeks, months, or years

**Risk Factors:**
- Genetic and physiological: link to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
- No dermatopathological diagnosis required for most cases
- Characteristic features on histopathology in some individuals

**Functional Consequences of Excoriation Disorder:**
- Associated with distress and social/occupational impairment
- Individuals spend at least 1 hour daily picking, thinking about or resisting urges to pick
- Avoidance of social events and going out in public reported by many individuals
- Significant work interference on a daily or weekly basis for some students
- Medical complications: tissue damage, scarring, infection, synovitis of wrists due to chronic picking. Rarely life-threatening.

###### Differential Diagnosis of Excoriation Disorder: Avoiding Misclassification

**Differential Diagnosis for Excoriation Disorder**

**Psychotic Disorder:**
- Skin picking may occur due to delusion (parasitosis) or hallucination (formication) in psychosis
- Excoriation disorder should not be diagnosed if skin picking is part of a psychotic symptom

**Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders:**
- Excessive washing compulsions with OCD may lead to skin lesions, but excoriation disorder should not be diagnosed
- Skin picking in body dysmorphic disorder due to appearance concerns is not excoriation disorder
- Description of Body-Focused Repetitive Behavior Disorder excludes individuals with excoriation symptoms

**Neurodevelopmental Disorders:**
- Stereotypic movement disorder may have early onset of self-injurious behavior, but it's not excoriation disorder
- Skin picking in neurogenetic conditions like Prader-Willi syndrome may meet criteria for stereotypic movement disorder

**Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders:**
- Excoriation disorder is not diagnosed if skin lesion is primarily attributable to deceptive behaviors in factitious disorder
- Other disorders with somatic symptoms, such as acne or scabies, may precipitate or exacerbate excoriation behavior but should be differentiated from excoriation disorder based on the extent of independent skin picking

**Substance/Medication-Induced Disorders:**
- Skin picking symptoms may be induced by certain substances (e.g., cocaine), in which case excoriation disorder should not be diagnosed
- Consider diagnosis of substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder if skin picking is clinically significant due to substance use

**Comorbidities:**
- Excoriation disorder often accompanies other mental disorders like OCD, trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), and major depressive disorder
- Repetitive body-focused symptoms other than skin picking and hair pulling (e.g., nail biting) may warrant an additional diagnosis of Body-Focused Repetitive Behavior Disorder.

###### Substance/Medication-Induced Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder

**Criteria for Diagnosis of Substance/Medication-Induced Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**

A. **Symptoms**:
- Obsessions, compulsions, skin picking, hair pulling, other body-focused repetitive behaviors, or symptoms characteristic of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
- Predominate in the clinical picture

B. **Evidence of Substance/Medication Involvement**:
1. Symptoms developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal
2. Symptoms caused by a medication capable of producing similar symptoms
3. Disturbance not better explained by an independent OCD disorder (preceding onset, persistence after cessation, or other evidence)

C. **Exclusion of Delirium**:
- No occurrence exclusively during the course of delirium

D. **Clinical Significance**:
- Causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas

**Diagnosis and Coding**:
- Should be made in addition to substance intoxication or withdrawal diagnosis if symptoms predominate and are severe enough
- ICD codes depend on comorbid substance use disorder (mild, moderate, or severe)
  - Amphetamine, cocaine, other stimulants: F15.188, F15.288, F15.989
  - Other or unknown substances: F19.188, F19.288, F19.989
- Specify onset type (intoxication, withdrawal, medication use)
- Record substance-induced OCD before any independent OCD diagnosis if present

**Recording Procedures for ICD-9-CM**:
- Substance/medication-induced OCD begins with specific substance and is followed by specification of onset type
- Separate diagnostic code given for substance use disorder

**Recording Procedures for ICD-10-CM**:
- Combines substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code

###### Substance-Induced Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

**Substance/Medication-Induced Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder**

**Essential Features:**
- Prominent symptoms of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (Criterion A) attributable to substance or medication use
- Development during or soon after substance intoxication, withdrawal, or medication exposure
- Capable of producing the symptoms (Criteria B)
- Improvement or remission within days to several weeks after discontinuing treatment

**Diagnosis:**
- Should not be given if onset precedes substance use or symptoms persist for a substantial period
- Additional diagnosis when symptoms outweigh normal intoxication effects and require independent attention
- Differentiated from substance intoxication, primary obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), OCD due to another medical condition, and delirium

**Associated Features:**
- Symptoms may occur with stimulants, heavy metals, or toxins intoxication
- Laboratory assessments like urine toxicology may be useful for substance measurement during assessment

**Prevalence:**
- Very rare in general population based on limited data available

**Differentiation from Other Diagnoses:**
- Substance intoxication: diagnosis of substance-specific intoxication suffices if symptoms are within expected range
- Primary OCD: onset before substance use, persistent symptoms after discontinuation, no association with intoxication or medication use
- Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition: attributable to another medical condition rather than medication taken for it; treatment change may determine causative agent if both conditions present.

**Delirium:** If symptoms occur exclusively during delirium, considered part of the delirium and not diagnosed separately.

#### Obsessive- Compulsive and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition

**Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- Predominance of obsessions, compulsions, preoccupations with appearance, hoarding, skin picking, hair pulling, or other body-focused repetitive behaviors (Criterion A)
- Evidence from history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition (Criterion B)
- Disturbance not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion C)
- Disturbance does not occur exclusively during delirium (Criterion D)
- Clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion E)

**Coding and Diagnostic Features**:
- Include the name of the other medical condition in the diagnosis (e.g., "obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to cerebral infarction")
- Code the other medical condition separately before the obsessive-compulsive disorder (e.g., "cerebral infarction; 294.8 [F06.8] obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to cerebral infarction")
- Obsessive-compulsive symptoms should be attributable to the medical condition through a pathophysiological mechanism
- Considerations for establishing etiological relationship: clear temporal association, atypical features, evidence in literature
- Cannot be better explained by primary obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive disorder, or another mental disorder

**Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis**:
- Obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms as a manifestation of certain medical disorders (e.g., striatal damage, such as cerebral infarction)
- Course generally follows the course of the underlying illness
- Laboratory assessments and medical examinations necessary to confirm diagnosis of another medical condition.

###### Diagnosing Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders: Causes, Differentiations, and Subtypes

**Differential Diagnosis for Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders (OCD)**

**Delirium:**
- No separate diagnosis if disturbance occurs exclusively during delirium
- Diagnosis of OCD may be given alongside major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) if:
  * Obsessive-compulsive symptoms are prominent in clinical presentation
  * Etiology is a physiological consequence of the pathological process causing dementia

**Mixed Presentation:**
- Specific mental disorder depends on which symptoms predominate

**Substance/Medication-Induced OCD:**
- Consider if there is evidence of recent or prolonged substance use, withdrawal, or exposure to toxins
- Useful to obtain urine or blood drug screen or other appropriate laboratory evaluation
- Symptoms occurring during or shortly after substance intoxication or withdrawal indicate a substance/medication-induced OCD

**Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders (Primary):**
- No specific physiological mechanisms associated with medical condition
- Late age at onset or atypical symptoms suggest the need for thorough assessment to rule out OCD due to another medical condition

**Illness Anxiety Disorder:**
- Characterized by preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness
- May or may not have diagnosed medical conditions

**Associated Feature of Another Mental Disorder:**
- Obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms may be an associated feature (e.g., schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa)

**Other Specified or Unspecified OCD:**
- Given when it's unclear whether the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms are primary, substance-induced, or due to another medical condition.

#### Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder

**Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders: Other Specified (300.3 F42)**
- **Description:** Category for presentations with symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorders that do not meet full criteria for any specific disorder in the class.
- **Examples:**
  - **Body dysmorphic-like disorder with actual flaws**: Preoccupation with noticeable physical appearance flaws causing significant distress or impairment.
  - **Body dysmorphic-like disorder without repetitive behaviors**: Similar to body dysmorphic disorder but no repetitive behaviors.
  - **Body-focused repetitive behavior disorder**: Characterized by recurrent body-focused repetitive behaviors (e.g., nail biting, lip biting) causing distress or impairment and not better explained by other disorders.
  - **Obsessional jealousy**: Excessive preoccupation with partner's perceived infidelity without delusions.
  - **Shubo-k yofu**: A variant of taijin kyofussho characterized by fear of having a bodily deformity.
  - **Koro**: Sudden, intense anxiety that the genitals will retract into the body, leading to death.
  - **Jikoshu-kyofu**: Fear of having an offensive body odor (also called olfactory reference syndrome).

**Unspecified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder (300.3 F42)**
- **Description:** Category for presentations with obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms that do not meet the criteria for any specific disorder.
- **Examples:** Presentations where there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis or when clinician chooses not to specify the reason for not meeting criteria for a specific disorder.

### Trauma and Stressor- Related Disorders

**Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders:**
* Includes disorders where exposure to traumatic or stressful event is a diagnostic criterion: reactive attachment disorder (RAD), disinhibited social engagement disorder (DSED), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, and adjustment disorders.
* Placement reflects relationship with anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, dissociative disorders.
* Variable psychological distress following exposure to a traumatic or stressful event: anxiety- or fear-based symptoms vs anhedonic, dysphoric, angry/aggressive, or dissociative symptoms.
* Heterogeneous picture with combination of symptoms present in some individuals.
* Social neglect as diagnostic requirement for both RAD and DSED.
* RAD expressed as internalizing disorder with depressive symptoms and withdrawn behavior; DSED marked by disinhibition and externalizing behavior.

#### Reactive Attachment Disorder

**Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **313.89 (F94.1)**: A consistent pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behavior toward adult caregivers
- **A. Inhibited Behavior**: 
  - The child rarely or minimally seeks comfort when distressed
  - The child rarely or minimally responds to comfort when distressed
- **B. Persistent Social and Emotional Disturbance**: 
  - Minimal social and emotional responsiveness to others
  - Limited positive affect
  - Episodes of unexplained irritability, sadness, or fearfulness that are evident even during nonthreatening interactions with adult caregivers
- **C. Pattern of Extremes of Insufficient Care**: 
  - Social neglect or deprivation in the form of persistent lack of having basic emotional needs for comfort, stimulation, and affection met by caregiving adults
  - Repeated changes of primary caregivers that limit opportunities to form stable attachments (e.g., frequent changes in foster care)
  - Rearing in unusual settings that severely limit opportunities to form selective attachments (e.g., institutions with high child-to-caregiver ratios)
- **D. Responsibility**: The care in Criterion C is presumed to be responsible for the disturbed behavior in Criterion A
- **E. No Autism Spectrum Disorder**:
- **F. Before Age 5 Years**:
- **G. Developmental Age**: At least 9 months

**Specifying the Disturbance**:
- **Persistent**: The disorder has been present for more than 12 months
- **Severity**: Reactive attachment disorder is specified as severe when a child exhibits all symptoms of the disorder, with each symptom manifesting at relatively high levels

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate attachment behaviors
- Absent or grossly underdeveloped attachment between the child and putative caregiving adults
- Children have capacity to form selective attachments but fail to show behavioral manifestations of selective attachments
- Diminished or absent expression of positive emotions during routine interactions with caregivers
- Episodes of negative emotions (fear, sadness, irritability) that are not readily explained
- **Not for Developmentally Unable to Form Selective Attachments**: The child must have a developmental age of at least 9 months

**Associated Features**:
- Developmental delays, especially in cognition and language
- Stereotypies and other signs of severe neglect (e.g., malnutrition or signs of poor care)

**Prevalence**:
- Prevalence of RAD is unknown, but it is seen rarely in clinical settings
- Found in young children exposed to severe neglect before being placed in foster care or raised in institutions
- Even in populations of severely neglected children, the disorder occurs less than 10% of the time

**Developmental Course**:
- Signs of absent-to-minimal attachment behaviors and associated emotional aberrant behaviors are evident from 9 months to 5 years of age
- Without remediation and recovery through normative caregiving environments, signs may persist for several years
- Unclear whether RAD occurs in older children and how it differs from its presentation in young children
- Diagnosis should be made with caution in children older than 5 years

**Risk Factors**:
- **Serious Social Neglect**: A diagnostic requirement for RAD
- Prognosis depends on the quality of the caregiving environment following serious neglect

**Cultural Considerations**:
- Attachment behaviors similar to RAD have been described in children across different cultures, but caution should be exercised in making the diagnosis in cultures where attachment has not been studied.

###### Distinguishing Reactive Attachment Disorder from Autism and Other Conditions

**Differential Diagnosis: Reactive Attachment Disorder vs. Autism Spectrum Disorder, Intellectual Disability, Depressive Disorders**

**Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) vs. Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)**
- Both conditions present with **dampened expression of positive emotions**, **cognitive and language delays**, and **impairments in social reciprocity**
- Differentiating factors:
  * History of neglect: Children with RAD have experienced severe social neglect, while ASD rarely has a history of social neglect
  * Restricted interests or ritualized behaviors: ASD exhibits restricted interests and repetitive behaviors (e.g., excessive adherence to rituals, fixated interests), which are not present in RAD
  * Deficit in social communication: Children with ASD show specific deficits in social communication, while children with RAD demonstrate comparable social communicative functioning overall
  * Selective attachment behaviors: Children with ASD typically display attachment behavior according to their developmental level, whereas children with RAD rarely or inconsistently do so
- **Important note**: Both conditions can present stereotypic behaviors like rocking and flapping

**Intellectual Disability (ID) vs. Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)**
- Developmental delays are often present in RAD but should not be confused with ID
  * Children with ID exhibit social and emotional skills comparable to their cognitive abilities, unlike children with RAD who show profound reduction in positive affect and emotion regulation difficulties
- At a developmental age of 7-9 months, children with ID should demonstrate selective attachments, regardless of their chronological age
  * In contrast, children with RAD may lack preferred attachment despite having attained a developmental age of at least 9 months

**Depressive Disorders vs. Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)**
- Depression in young children can be associated with reductions in positive affect
- Young children diagnosed with depressive disorders still seek and respond to comforting efforts by caregivers, unlike children with RAD who may not demonstrate attachment behavior or only do so inconsistently
- Comorbid conditions often accompany neglect in RAD, including cognitive delays, language delays, stereotypies, medical conditions (e.g., severe malnutrition), and depressive symptoms

#### Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder

**Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSED)**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **313.89 (F94.2)**: Diagnosis code for DSED
- **A. Pattern of behavior**: Child actively approaches and interacts with unfamiliar adults, exhibiting at least two of the following:
  - Reduced or absent reticence in approaching and interacting
  - Overly familiar verbal or physical behavior (not age-appropriate or culturally sanctioned)
  - Diminished or absent checking back with adult caregiver after venturing away
  - Willingness to go off with unfamiliar adult with minimal hesitation
- **B. Socially disinhibited behavior**: Behavior in Criterion A is not limited to impulsivity (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder)
- **C. Persistent insufficient care**: Evidenced by at least one of the following:
  - Social neglect or deprivation: Persistent lack of basic emotional needs for comfort, stimulation, and affection from caregiving adults
  - Repeated changes in primary caregivers: Limit opportunities to form stable attachments
  - Rearing in unusual settings: Severely limit opportunities to form selective attachments
- **D. Responsibility for disturbed behavior**: DSED behaviors are presumed to be a result of the pathogenic care in Criterion C
- **E. Developmental age**: Child must have a developmental age of at least 9 months

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Essential feature: Pattern of culturally inappropriate, overly familiar behavior with unfamiliar adults (Criterion A)
- Not before 9 months old: Child must be able to form selective attachments

**Associated Features**:
- Co-occurrence with developmental delays: Cognitive and language delays, stereotypies, other signs of severe neglect
- Persistence of symptoms: Even after other signs of neglect are no longer present
- Can occur without disordered attachment

###### Diagnosis, Manifestations, and Differential Diagnosis

**Disinhibited Social Attachment Disorder (DSAD)**
- Rare condition occurring in a minority of children, even those severely neglected
- Prevalence unknown but estimated to be around 20% in high-risk populations
- Early signs may appear before age two and are moderately stable if neglect persists
- Characterized by indiscriminate social behavior, lack of reticence towards strangers, and attention seeking behaviors
- Verbal overfamiliarity and inauthentic emotional expression during middle childhood
- Peer relationships affected in adolescence with superficial peer relationships and more conflicts
- Not described in adults
- Diagnostic requirement: serious social neglect

**Environmental Risk Factors for DSAD:**
- Severe social neglect is the only known risk factor
- Majority of severely neglected children do not develop the disorder
- Neurobiological vulnerability may play a role, but no clear link established
- Disorder not identified in children experiencing neglect after age 2 years
- Course and prognosis modifiers: caregiving quality seems to affect course, but some signs may persist even with improved environments.

**Functional Consequences of DSAD:**
- Impairs interpersonal relationships with adults and peers

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): children with DSAD do not exhibit difficulties with attention or hyperactivity, unlike those with ADHD.
- Comorbid Conditions: cognitive delays, language delays, stereotypies may co-occur with DSAD; some children may have both DSAD and ADHD simultaneously.

- **12-month prevalence (US):** about 3.5% among adults
- **Lower estimates:** Europe, most Asian, African, Latin American countries: clustering around 0.5%-1.0%
- **Variations in risk:** Conditional probability of developing PTSD may vary across cultural groups
- **Highest rates:** survivors of rape, military combat and captivity, ethnic/political internment or genocide
- **Prevalence in specific populations:** Veterans, police, firefighters, emergency medical personnel
- **Variations with age:** Higher prevalence among children and adolescents (lower reporting due to insufficient developmentally informed criteria)
- **Older adults:** Lower reported prevalence of full-threshold PTSD; more common subthreshold presentations with clinical impairment
- **Differences between ethnic groups:** U.S. Latinos, African Americans, American Indians have higher rates; Asian Americans have lower rates after adjusting for traumatic exposure and demographic variables

**Symptoms of PTSD:**
- **Can occur at any age:** Beginning after the first year of life
- **Timeline:** Symptoms usually begin within 3 months after trauma, with variations in duration
- **Delayed expression:** Evidence for delayed onset (now called "delayed expression")
- **Variations across development:** Children may express reexperiencing through play; older children and adolescents judge themselves as cowardly
- **Symptom clusters:** Hyperarousal, avoidance, negative cognitions and moods
- **Co-occurring traumas:** Young children may experience co-occurring traumas
- **Impact on older adults:** Associated with negative health perceptions, primary care utilization, suicidal ideation
- **Expressions of reexperiencing:** Children focus on imagined interventions; adults may judge themselves as socially undesirable and estranged from peers.

###### Risk Factors and Impact of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

**Risk Factors for PTSD:**

**Pretraumatic Factors:**
- Childhood emotional problems (prior traumatic exposure, externalizing or anxiety problems)
- Prior mental disorders (panic disorder, depressive disorder, PTSD, OCD)

- Exposure to prior trauma during childhood
- Family dysfunction, parental separation or death
- Cultural characteristics (fatalistic or self-blaming coping strategies)
- Lower intelligence
- Minority racial/ethnic status
- Genetic predisposition
- Female gender and younger age at time of trauma exposure (for adults)

**Peritraumatic Factors:**
- Severity (dose) of the trauma
- Perceived life threat
- Personal injury
- Interpersonal violence, particularly trauma perpetrated by a caregiver or involving a witnessed threat to a caregiver in children
- Dissociation during and after trauma

**Posttraumatic Factors:**
- Negative appraisals
- Inappropriate coping strategies
- Acute stress disorder (ASD) development
- Subsequent exposure to repeated upsetting reminders
- Adverse life events or financial/other trauma-related losses
- Lack of social support, including family stability

**Cultural Factors:**
- Type of traumatic exposure and its impact on disorder severity
- Meaning attributed to the traumatic event (e.g., inability to perform funerary rites)
- Ongoing sociocultural context (e.g., living among unpunished perpetrators)
- Cultural factors, such as acculturative stress in immigrants
- Variation in symptom expression or symptom clusters

**Gender:**
- Higher prevalence of PTSD among females than males across the lifespan
- Longer duration of PTSD for females compared to males
- Greater likelihood of exposure to traumatic events, such as rape and interpersonal violence in both genders
- Attenuated or nonsignificant differences in risk for PTSD when exposed specifically to these stressors.

**Functional Consequences of PTSD:**
- High levels of social, occupational, and physical disability
- Economic costs and high levels of medical utilization
- Impaired functioning across various domains (social, interpersonal, developmental, educational, physical health, and occupational) in community and veteran samples.

###### Differential Diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

**PTSD vs. Adjustment Disorders**
- **Adjustment disorders**: Stressor can be of any severity or type compared to PTSD Criterion A
- Diagnosed when response to a stressor does not meet all other PTSD criteria or mental disorder criteria
- Can also occur in response to non-traumatic events

**Other Posttraumatic Disorders and Conditions**
- **Panic disorder**: Symptoms do not meet definition of obsession, intrusions are unrelated to traumatic event
- **Generalized anxiety disorder, irritability**: Avoidance, irritability, and anxiety are not associated with a specific traumatic event
- **Separation anxiety disorder**: Symptoms related to separation from home or family rather than trauma event
- **Major depressive disorder**: May or may not be preceded by trauma, lacks PTSD symptoms like reexperiencing and avoidance
- **Personality disorders**: Interpersonal difficulties may indicate PTSD if they are trauma-related
- **Dissociative disorders**: Dissociative amnesia, identity disorder, depersonalization-derealization disorder: Can be preceded by or have co-occurring PTSD symptoms; consider "with dissociative symptoms" subtype when full criteria are met
- **Conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder)**: New onset of somatic symptoms within context of posttraumatic distress may indicate PTSD rather than conversion disorder

**Acute Stress Disorder vs. PTSD**
- **Acute stress disorder**: Symptom pattern restricted to 3 days to 1 month following traumatic event

**Other Diagnoses Excluded by PTSD**
- **Anxiety disorders, OCD**: Arousal and dissociative symptoms of panic disorder not related to specific traumatic event; intrusive thoughts in OCD do not meet definition of obsession
- **Separation anxiety disorder**: Symptoms clearly related to separation from home or family rather than trauma event
- **Major depressive disorder**: Lack of PTSD symptoms like reexperiencing and avoidance if other criteria are present
- **Personality disorders, dissociative disorders**: Interpersonal difficulties may indicate PTSD if they have onset or exacerbation after traumatic exposure
- **Dissociative disorders**: Differentiate by presence of specific symptoms; consider "with dissociative symptoms" subtype when full criteria are met
- **Conversion disorder, psychotic disorders**: Symptoms may overlap with PTSD, but can be distinguished based on presence of distinctive symptoms

**Comorbidity and Co-occurring Conditions in PTSD**
- Individuals with PTSD more likely to have other mental disorders (e.g., depressive, bipolar, anxiety, substance use)
- Comorbid substance use disorder and conduct disorder more common among males
- Co-occurrence of PTSD and mild TBI: 48% in U.S. military personnel and combat veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq wars
- Children with PTSD often have comorbid conditions, but patterns different than adults (oppositional defiant disorder, separation anxiety disorder predominant)
- Considerable comorbidity between PTSD and neurocognitive disorders; some overlapping symptoms.

#### Acute Stress Disorder

**Acute Stress Disorder: Diagnostic Criteria (DSM-5)**

A. **Exposure**:
- Directly experiencing a traumatic event
- Witnessing, in person, the event occur to others
- Learning about a violent or accidental death of a close family member or friend
- Experiencing repeated/extreme exposure to details of the traumatic event

B. **Symptoms**:
- **Intrusion Symptoms**: Recurrent distressing memories, dreams, flashbacks, intense reactions
- **Negative Mood**: Persistent inability to experience positive emotions, altered sense of reality
- **Dissociative Symptoms**: Dissociative reactions, memory loss
- **Avoidance Symptoms**: Efforts to avoid reminders and distressing memories/thoughts
- **Arousal Symptoms**: Sleep disturbances, irritability, hypervigilance, problems with concentration, exaggerated startle response

C. **Duration**: Disturbance lasts 3 days to 1 month after trauma exposure
- Symptoms typically begin immediately but persistence is required for the disorder

D. **Functioning**: Causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational functioning

E. **Exclusions**: Not attributable to substance/medical condition and not better explained by another mental health disorder.

###### Acute Stress Disorder: Symptoms and Diagnostic Criteria

**Diagnostic Features of Acute Stress Disorder**

**Essential Feature**:
- Development of characteristic symptoms lasting 3 days to 1 month following exposure to a traumatic event

**Traumatic Events**:
- Experienced directly: war, violent personal assault, natural/human-made disasters, severe accidents
- For children: inappropriate sexual experiences without violence or injury
- Indirect: close relatives or friends experiencing violence or accident

**Clinical Presentation**:
- Variable by individual
- Anxiety response: reexperiencing of or reactivity to traumatic event
  - Dissociative or detached presentation
  - Strong emotional or physiological reactivity
- Full symptom picture for at least 3 days after trauma

**Witnessed Events**:
- Observing threatened or serious injury, unnatural death, physical/sexual violence
- Indirect: close relatives or friends experiencing violence or accident
- Severe when interpersonal and intentional (e.g., torture, rape)

**Symptoms of Acute Stress Disorder**:
- Intrusive memories of event with sensory, emotional, or physiological components
- Distressing dreams thematically related to traumatic event
- Dissociative states lasting seconds to hours or days
  - Reliving components of event
- Intense psychological distress or physiological reactivity to triggering events
- Persistent inability to feel positive emotions
- Alterations in awareness: depersonalization, derealization, dissociative amnesia
- Avoidance strategies for traumatic experience/triggering stimuli
- Difficulties with sleep onset and maintenance, nightmares, elevated arousal
- Heightened sensitivity to potential threats
- Concentration difficulties and heightened startle response

**Associated Features**:
- Catastrophic or negative thoughts about the traumatic event or self
- Panic attacks in initial month after trauma exposure
- Chaotic or impulsive behavior (e.g., reckless driving, irrational decisions, excessive gambling)
- Significant separation anxiety and attention needs from caregivers (children)
- Acute grief reactions following a death in traumatic circumstances
- Postconcussive symptoms (headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits)

###### Acute Stress Disorder: Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Impact on Functioning

**Acute Stress Disorder (ASD)**

**Prevalence**:
- Less than 20% of cases following non-interpersonal traumas (e.g., motor vehicle accidents, mild brain injury)
- Higher rates (20%-50%) after interpersonal traums (assault, rape, mass shooting)

**Development and Course**:
- Cannot be diagnosed until 3 days post-trauma
- May progress to **Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)** or remain transient
- Half of individuals with PTSD initially present as ASD

**Symptoms in Children**:
- Young children may report frightening dreams without trauma references
- Preferential play related to trauma
- Emotional expressions other than fear
- Avoidance or preoccupation with reminders

**Risk Factors**:
- **Prior mental disorder**
- High levels of negative affectivity (neuroticism)
- Perceived severity of traumatic event
- Avoidant coping style
- Catastrophizing appraisals

**Environmental Factors**:
- Exposure to traumatic event
- History of prior trauma

**Genetic and Physiological Factors**:
- Females at greater risk for ASD
- Elevated **acoustic startle response** pre-trauma increases risk

**Cultural Considerations**:
- Symptom profile may vary across cultures
- Dissociative responses, nightmares, avoidance, somatic symptoms can differ

**Gender Differences**:
- More prevalent in females than males
- Sex-linked neurological differences contribute to increased risk

**Functional Consequences**:
- Impaired social, interpersonal, occupational functioning
- Extreme anxiety may interfere with sleep, energy levels, and attention.

###### Acute Stress Disorder vs. Other Psychological Disorders: Key Differences

**Differential Diagnosis**
- **Adjustment disorders**:
  - Adjustment disorder diagnosis used when response to a Criterion A event does not meet criteria for acute stress disorder or another specific mental disorder
  - Symptom pattern of acute stress disorder occurs in response to a stressor that does not meet Criterion A for exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence
  - Examples: Severe stress reactions to life-threatening illnesses, anger, depression, or guilt responses
  - Depressive or anger responses may involve rumination about the traumatic event, unlike involuntary and intrusive distressing memories in acute stress disorder
- **Panic disorder**:
  - Spontaneous panic attacks common in acute stress disorder
  - Diagnosis of panic disorder if panic attacks are unexpected and there is anxiety about future attacks or maladaptive changes in behavior associated with fear of dire consequences
- **Dissociative disorders**:
  - Severe dissociative responses without characteristic acute stress disorder symptoms may be diagnosed as derealization/depersonalization disorder
  - If severe amnesia of trauma persists without characteristic acute stress disorder symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative amnesia may be indicated
- **Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**:
  - Acute stress disorder distinguished from PTSD by symptom pattern occurring within 1 month of traumatic event and resolving within that period
  - If symptoms persist for more than 1 month and meet criteria for PTSD, the diagnosis is changed to PTSD
- **Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)**:
  - In OCD, recurrent intrusive thoughts do not meet definition of an obsession
  - Intrusive thoughts are not related to a traumatic event, compulsions are present, and other symptoms of acute stress disorder are typically absent
- **Psychotic disorders**:
  - Flashbacks in acute stress disorder must be distinguished from illusions, hallucinations, and other perceptual disturbances that may occur in schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders, depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, a delirium, substance/medication-induced disorders, or psychotic disorders due to another medical condition
  - Acute stress disorder flashbacks are directly related to the traumatic experience and occur in the absence of other psychotic or substance-induced features
- **Traumatic brain injury (TBI)**:
  - When a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event, symptoms of acute stress disorder may appear
  - Event causing head trauma can constitute both a psychological and a neurological trauma
  - Symptoms previously termed postconcussive (e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits) can occur in brain-injured and non-brain injured populations, including individuals with acute stress disorder
  - Differential diagnosis between acute stress disorder symptoms and TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms is possible based on the presence of distinctive symptoms for each condition
  - Repexperiencing and avoidance are characteristic of acute stress disorder and not effects of TBI, while persistent disorientation and confusion are more specific to TBI

#### Adjustment Disorders

**Adjustment Disorders**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- A. Development of emotional or behavioral symptoms within 3 months of an identifiable stressor(s)
- B. Clinically significant distress out of proportion to the severity/intensity of the stressor, or significant impairment in functioning
- C. Stress-related disturbance does not meet criteria for another mental disorder and is not an exacerbation of a preexisting disorder
- D. Does not represent normal bereavement
- E. Symptoms do not persist beyond 6 months after the termination of the stressor/consequences
- **Specify**:
  - 309.0 (F43.21): With depressed mood: Low mood, tearfulness, feelings of hopelessness
  - 309.24 (F43.22): With anxiety: Nervousness, worry, jitteriness, separation anxiety
  - 309.28 (F43.23): With mixed anxiety and depressed mood: Combination of depression and anxiety
  - 309.3 (F43.24): With disturbance of conduct: Disturbance in conduct is predominant
  - 309.4 (F43.25): With mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct: Both emotional symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) and a disturbance of conduct are predominant
  - 309.9 (F43.20): Unspecified: For maladaptive reactions that cannot be classified as one of the specific subtypes

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Presence of emotional/behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor is the essential feature
- Stressor may be a single event or multiple, recurrent/continuous
- Stressors may affect individuals, families, or larger groups/communities
- May accompany specific developmental events (e.g., school, leaving home, marriage, failing occupational goals)
- Can be diagnosed following the death of a loved one with excessive/persistent grief reactions

**Prevalence**:
- Prevalence may vary widely depending on population and assessment methods used
- In outpatient mental health treatment, 5% to 20% have a principal diagnosis of an adjustment disorder
- In hospital psychiatric settings, often the most common diagnosis, up to 50%

**Development and Course**:
- Disturbance begins within 3 months of stressor onset and lasts no more than 6 months after its termination
- If stressor is acute (e.g., job loss), onset is immediate, duration brief
- If stressor/consequences persist, adjustment disorder may also continue to be present and become the persistent form
- Increased risk for suicide attempts and completed suicide

**Environmental Risks**:
- Individuals from disadvantaged life circumstances experience high rates of stressors and are at increased risk for adjustment disorders

**Cultural Considerations**:
- Cultural context should be taken into account when evaluating the response to a stressor as maladaptive or excessive
- Nature, meaning, and experience of stressors/evaluation of responses may vary across cultures

###### Differentiating Adjustment Disorders from Other Mental Health Conditions

**Differential Diagnosis: Adjustment Disorders vs. Other Conditions**

**Major Depressive Disorder**:
- If symptoms meet criteria for MDD, adjustment disorder diagnosis is not applicable
- Symptom profile of MDD differentiates it from adjustment disorders

**Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Acute Stress Disorder (ASD)**:
- Adjustment disorders can be diagnosed immediately and persist up to 6 months after exposure
- ASD: can only occur between 3 days and 1 month, Criterion A of PTSD not met
- **Symptom profile** for PTSD and ASD differentiates them from adjustment disorders
- Individuals with adjustment disorder may exhibit symptoms of acute stress disorder or PTSD without meeting full diagnostic criteria

**Personality Disorders**:
- Some personality features may increase vulnerability to situational distress, but do not indicate an adjustment disorder
- If adjustment disorder symptom criteria are met and exceed maladaptive PD symptoms (Criterion C), diagnosis of an adjustment disorder should be made

**Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions**:
- Psychological factors can exacerbate medical conditions, but do not indicate an adjustment disorder
- Adjustment disorders are reactions to stressors, rather than consequences of underlying conditions or illnesses

**Normative Stress Reactions**:
- Most people get upset when bad things happen, but this does not necessarily indicate an adjustment disorder
- Diagnosis is only warranted when the magnitude of distress exceeds normal expectations or results in functional impairment

**Comorbidity**:
- Adjustment disorders can accompany various mental disorders and medical conditions
- Adjustment disorder diagnosis should only be made if symptoms are not explained by another condition
- Common comorbidities: depression, bipolar disorder, medical illnesses

#### Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder

**Other Specified Trauma-and Stressor-Related Disorder (309.89 or F43.8)**

**Characteristics:**
- Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning
- Do not meet full criteria for any specific trauma-and stressor-related disorder
- Used to communicate specific reason for non-diagnosis

**Examples:**
1. **Adjustment Disorder with Delayed Onset and Duration**:
   - Symptoms occur more than 3 months after the stressor
   - Prolonged duration without stressor, beyond 6 months
2. **Ataque de nervios**:
   - Cultural concept of distress (see "Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress" in Appendix for details)
3. **Other Cultural Syndromes**:
   - Cultural concepts of distress (see "Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress" in Appendix for details)
4. **Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder:**
   - Severe and persistent grief and mourning reactions
   - Characterized by: sadness, despair, anger, anxiety, or disbelief about the loss
5. **Adjustment Disorder with Prolonged Duration**:
   - Symptoms persist for more than 6 months without a prolonged duration of stressor

#### Unspecified Trauma-and Stressor-Related Disorder

**Unspecified Trauma-and Stressor-Related Disorder (309.9 [F43.9])**
* Category for presentations where trauma symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment, but don't meet full criteria of a specific disorder
* Used when clinician chooses not to specify reason for unmet criteria or insufficient information is available (e.g., emergency room settings)

### Dissociative Disorders

**Characteristics**:
- Disruption of normal integration of consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, motor control, and behavior
- Potential disruption of every area of psychological functioning

**Types of Dissociative Symptoms**:
- **Positive symptoms**: Unbidden intrusions, losses of continuity in subjective experience (fragmentation of identity, depersonalization, derealization)
- **Negative symptoms**: Inability to access information or control mental functions (amnesia)

**Relationship with Trauma**:
- Frequently found after trauma
- Symptoms influenced by proximity to trauma
- Dissociative disorders placed next to, but not part of, trauma and stressor-related disorders in DSM-5

**DSM-5 Diagnostic Categories**:
- **Dissociative Disorders**
  - **Depersonalization/derealization disorder**
    - Clinically significant persistent or recurrent depersonalization and derealization
    - Intact reality testing
  - No distinction between individuals with predominantly depersonalization vs. derealization symptoms
  - Individuals can have both depersonalization and derealization
- **Dissociative Amnesia**
  - Inability to recall autobiographical information
  - May be localized, selective, or generalized
  - Absence of awareness of amnesia until personal identity is lost or circumstances make it evident
- **Dissociative Fugue** (rare in dissociative amnesia but common in dissociative identity disorder)
- **Dissociative Identity Disorder**
  - Presence of two or more distinct personality states or experience of possession
  - Recurrent episodes of amnesia
  - Fragmentation of identity may vary with culture and circumstance
- **Other Specified Dissociative Disorder**
  - Chronic or recurrent mixed dissociative symptoms approaching but falling short of the criteria for dissociative identity disorder
  - Dissociative states secondary to brainwashing or thought reform
  - Two acute presentations (less than 1 month duration) of mixed dissociative symptoms, one marked by psychotic symptoms
  - Single-symptom dissociative presentations: dissociative trance, dissociative stupor or coma, and Ganser's syndrome

#### Dissociative Identity Disorder

**Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)**
- **Criteria for DID**:
  - **A. Disruption of identity**: Presence of two or more distinct personality states or experience of possession
    - Marked discontinuity in sense of self and sense of agency
    - Accompanied by related alterations in affect, behavior, consciousness, memory, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning
  - **B. Recurrent gaps in the recall of everyday events**: Inconsistent with ordinary forgetting
  - **C. Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment**: Social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
  - **D. Disturbance not a normal part of cultural or religious practice**: In children, symptoms not better explained by imaginary play or fantasy
  - **E. Not attributable to physiological effects or medical condition**

**Diagnostic Features of DID**
- Presence of two or more distinct personality states or experience of possession (Criterion A)
  * Overtness/covertness varies based on motivation, stress, conflict, emotional resilience, and culture
  - Manifestations of alternate identities: highly overt in some cases; not directly observed in others
- Sudden alterations or discontinuities in sense of self and sense of agency (Criterion A)
  * Individuals report feeling like a detached observer of their speech/actions, powerless to control
  - Perception of voices, strange thought streams, strong emotions/impulses, unexplained changes in attitude/preferences
- Recurrent dissociative amnesias (Criterion B)
  * Gaps in memory of personal life events or important information
  * Lapses in dependable memory
  * Discovering evidence of everyday actions and tasks

**Additional Features Supporting DID Diagnosis**
- Comorbid conditions: depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, non-epileptic seizures
- Dissociative flashbacks with sensory reliving of past events and changes in identity/consciousness
- Multiple types of interpersonal maltreatment during childhood and adulthood
- Brain regions involved: orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala.

###### Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Functional Impact of Dissociative Identity Disorder

**Prevalence**
- 12-month prevalence of dissociative identity disorder: 1.5% among adults in a small U.S. community study
- Prevalence across genders: 1.6% for males, 1.4% for females

**Development and Course**
- Dissociation may manifest at any age from childhood to late life
- Children present primarily with overlap and interference among mental states (Criterion A phenomena) rather than identity changes
- Sudden changes in identity during adolescence could be just adolescent turmoil or early stages of another disorder
- Older individuals may present symptoms resembling mood disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, paranoia, psychotic mood disorders, cognitive disorders due to dissociative amnesia
- Disruptive affects and memories may increase with age and be triggered by:
  - Removal from traumatic situation (e.g., leaving home)
  - Children reaching the same age as original abuse or trauma
  - Later traumatic experiences, even seemingly inconsequential ones (like a minor car accident)
  - Death or onset of fatal illness in abuser(s)

**Risk Factors and Prognosis**
- Environmental: interpersonal physical and sexual abuse increases risk of dissociative identity disorder; prevalence of childhood abuse and neglect: about 90%
- Culture-related: features influenced by cultural background, but involuntary, distressing, uncontrollable symptoms distinguish from culturally accepted possession states
- Gender: females dominate in adult clinical settings, males may deny symptoms leading to false negatives
- Suicide risk: over 70% have attempted suicide; complicated assessment due to amnesia or unawareness of suicidal dissociated identities

**Functional Consequences**
- Variable impairment from minimal to profound
- Minimal symptoms may affect relational, marital, family, and parenting functions more than occupational life
- With appropriate treatment, many high-functioning individuals show marked improvement in occupational and personal functioning
- Some remain highly impaired and respond slowly to long-term supportive treatment.

###### Differential Diagnosis of Dissociative Identity Disorder: Key Distinctions from Other Mental Health Conditions

**Differential Diagnosis: Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)**

**Criteria for DID:**
- Division of identity
- Recurrent disruption of conscious functioning and sense of self

**Differential Diagnosis from Other Specified Dissociative Disorders:**
- Presence of chronic or recurring mixed dissociative symptoms
- No recurrent amnesia

**Comparison with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):**
- Depression may appear in some identity states but not others
- Elevated or depressed mood may shift between identities

**Comparison with Bipolar Disorders:**
- Rapid shifts in mood within minutes or hours
- Mood changes related to alterations in dissociative states, not bipolar disorders

**Comparison with PTSD:**
- Presence of amnesia for some aspects of trauma and dissociative flashbacks without awareness of current orientation
- Dissociative symptoms not characteristic of acute stress disorder or PTSD
- Absence of dissociative symptoms like arnn esias for everyday events, dissociative flashbacks with amnesia, disruptive intrusions by identities, and infrequent full-blown identity changes

**Comparison with Psychotic Disorders:**
- Personified inner voices, identity fragmentation, and loss of control over thoughts/feelings may be confused with psychotic symptoms
- Dissociative experiences described in personified way, no delusional explanations

**Comparison with Substance/Medication-Induced Disorders:**
- Symptoms not related to substance use or etiologically connected to disturbance

**Comparison with Personality Disorders:**
- Longitudinal variability in personality style due to inconsistency among identities
- Distinction from pervasive dysfunction in affect management and interpersonal relationships typical of those with personality disorders

**Comparison with Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder):**
- Absence of identity disruption or experience of possession
- Limited dissociation compared to DID

**Factitious Disorders and Malingering:**
- Overreported symptoms, underreporting comorbid symptoms
- Individuals with genuine DID ashamed, overwhelmed by symptoms

**Comorbidities:**
- High prevalence of PTSD, depressive disorders, trauma-related disorders, personality disorders (avoidant and borderline), conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder), somatic symptom disorder, eating disorders, substance-related disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, sleep disorders.

#### Dissociative Amnesia

**Dissociative Amnesia Diagnostic Criteria (F44.0)**

A. **Inability to recall important autobiographical information:**
- Traumatic or stressful nature
- Inconsistent with ordinary forgetting

B. **Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment:**
- Social functioning
- Occupational functioning

C. **Not attributable to substance use, neurological conditions:**
- Alcohol or other drug abuse
- Medication
- Neurological condition

D. **Rule out other disorders:**
- Dissociative identity disorder
- Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
- Acute stress disorder
- Somatic symptom disorder
- Major or mild neurological cognitive disorder

**Diagnostic Features:**
1. Inability to recall important autobiographical information
2. Potentially reversible memory loss
3. Localized amnesia: failure to recall events during a circumscribed period of time
4. Selective amnesia: remembering some, not all events
5. Generalized amnesia: complete loss of memory for one's life history or identity
6. Acute onset with perplexity and disorientation
7. Unawareness or partial awareness of memory problems
8. Chronically impaired in forming and sustaining relationships
9. History of trauma, child abuse, victimization
10. Dissociative flashbacks: behavioral reexperiencing of traumatic events
11. Self-mutilation, suicide attempts, high-risk behaviors
12. Depressive symptoms
13. Functional neurological symptoms
14. Depersonalization
15. Auto-hypnotic symptoms
16. High hypnotizability
17. Sexual dysfunctions.

###### Prevalence, Causes, and Impact of Dissociative Amnesia

**Prevalence of Dissociative Amnesia:**
- Prevalence for adults in a small U.S. community: 1.8% (1.0% males, 2.6% females)
- Sudden onset of generalized amnesia
- Less known about localized and selective amnesias
- Delayed onset may be hours, days, or longer
- Multiple episodes possible
- Duration: minutes to decades
- Can resolve rapidly or persist for long periods
- Some individuals recall memories years later
- Distress, suicidal behavior, PTSD symptoms upon memory return
- Observed in children, adolescents, and adults

**Risk Factors:**
- Traumatic experiences: war, childhood maltreatment, natural disasters, internment camps, genocide
- Greater number of adverse childhood experiences, especially physical/sexual abuse
- Interpersonal violence
- Increased severity, frequency, and violence of trauma

**Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues:**
- Non-epileptic seizures and functional neurological symptoms common in Asia, Middle East, Latin America
- Precipitants may not involve frank trauma but severe psychological stresses or conflicts (marital conflict, family disturbances, attachment problems, restriction or oppression)

**Suicidal Behavior:**
- High risk for suicidal and self-destructive behaviors
- Particularly high when amnesia remits suddenly and overwhelms individual with intolerable memories.

**Functional Consequences:**
- Limited to severe impairment in individuals with localized, selective or systematized dissociative amnesia
- Chronic generalized dissociative amnesia: vocationally and interpersonally disabled.

###### Distinguishing Dissociative Amnesia from Other Memory Disorders

**Differential Diagnosis of Amnesia**

**Dissociative Amnesia vs. Dissociative Identity Disorder:**
- Individuals with dissociative amnesia report depersonalization and auto-hypnotic symptoms
- Individuals with dissociative identity disorder report pervasive discontinuities in sense of self and agency, accompanied by other dissociative symptoms
- Amnesias in dissociative amnesia are relatively stable compared to those in dissociative identity disorder
- Amnesias in dissociative identity disorder include: unexplained possessions, sudden fluctuations in skills/knowledge, major gaps in recall of life history, and brief amnesic gaps in interpersonal interactions

**Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):**
- Some individuals with PTSD cannot recall part or all of a specific traumatic event
- When memory loss extends beyond the immediate time of trauma, comorbid diagnosis of dissociative amnesia is warranted

**Neurocognitive Disorders:**
- Memory loss in neurocognitive disorders is usually embedded in cognitive, linguistic, affective, attentional, and behavioral disturbances
- In dissociative amnesia, memory deficits are primarily for autobiographical information; intellectual abilities are preserved
- Substance-related disorders: "black outs" or periods of memory loss occur only in the context of intoxication and not in other situations

**Posttraumatic Amnesia due to Brain Injury:**
- Amnesia may occur after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) with an impact to the head or rapid movement/displacement of the brain within the skull
- Other TBI symptoms include loss of consciousness, disorientation and confusion, neurological signs
- Posttraumatic amnesia due to TBI must present either immediately after injury or immediately after recovering consciousness, and persist past acute period
- Cognitive presentation of neurocognitive disorder following TBI is variable and includes difficulties in attention, executive function, learning/memory, slowed information processing, social cognition

**Seizure Disorders:**
- Individuals with seizure disorders may exhibit complex behavior during seizures or post-ictally with amnesia
- Behavior in dissociative fugue is usually purposeful, complex, and goal-directed for days, weeks, or longer
- Amnesia in seizure disorder is not associated with traumatic circumstances and appears random

**Catatonic Stupor:**
- Mutism in catatonic stupor may suggest dissociative amnesia, but failure of recall is absent
- Other catatonic symptoms (e.g., rigidity, posturing, negativism) are usually present

**Factitious Disorder and Malingering:**
- No test distinguishes dissociative amnesia from feigned amnesia with certainty
- Individuals with factitious disorder or malingering continue deception during hypnotic or barbiturate-facilitated interviews
- Feigned amnesia is more common in individuals with acute, florid dissociative amnesia; financial, sexual, or legal problems; wish to escape stressful circumstances

**Comorbidity:**
- Affective phenomena may surface as dysphoria, grief, rage, shame, guilt, psychological conflict and turmoil, suicidal/homicidal ideation, impulses, acts when dissociative amnesia remits
- Individuals with dissociative amnesia may develop PTSD, somatic symptom disorder, conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder), personality disorders

#### Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder

**Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DDD)**

**Criteria for Diagnosis**:
- Persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both:
  - **Depersonalization**: Unreality, detachment, feeling like an outside observer (perceptual alterations, distorted sense of time, unreal or absent self, emotional and/or physical numbing)
  - **Derealization**: Unreality, detachment with respect to surroundings (individuals or objects are experienced as unreal, dreamlike, foggy, lifeless, or visually distorted)
- Reality testing remains intact during the experiences
- Causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning
- Not attributable to physiological effects of substances or medical conditions
- Not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, panic disorder)

**Symptoms and Features**:
- Persistent episodes of depersonalization, derealization, or both
- Feeling detached from the whole self or aspects of it (e.g., "I am no one", "I have no self")
- Detachment from feelings, thoughts, body, or actions
- Diminished sense of agency (feeling robotic, lacking control over speech/movement)
- Split self with observer and participant parts ("out-of-body experience")
- Anomalous body experiences, emotional or physical numbing, temporal distortions
- Subjective visual distortions (blurriness, heightened acuity, etc.) or auditory distortions
- Difficulty describing symptoms, fear of being "crazy" or "going crazy"
- Associated symptoms: altered sense of time, vague somatic symptoms (head fullness, tingling), extreme rumination, obsessive preoccupation, anxiety, depression.

**Neurological Substrates**:
- Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis
- Inferior parietal lobule
- Prefrontal cortical-limbic circuits

###### Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder: Causes, Symptoms, and Functional Consequences

**Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder**

**Prevalence:**
- Common transient symptoms in general population
- Lifetime prevalence of depersonalization/derealization disorder: approximately 2% (0.8-2.8%)
- More common in younger adults, onset rare after age 40

**Characteristics:**
- Mean age at onset: 16 years
- Sudden or gradual onset
- Duration varies greatly
  - Brief episodes: hours to days
  - Prolonged episodes: weeks, months, or years
  - Continuous symptoms possible
- Intensity may wax and wane
- Triggered by stress, mood changes, overstimulation, physical factors
- Harm-avoidant temperament
  * Immature defenses: idealization/devaluation, projection, acting out
  * Cognitive disconnection schemata: defectiveness, emotional inhibition
  * Overconnection schemata: dependency, vulnerability, incompetence
- Association with childhood interpersonal trauma, emotional abuse, neglect
- Other stressors: severe stress, depression, anxiety (particularly panic attacks), illicit drug use

**Functional Consequences:**
- Highly distressing symptoms associated with major morbidity
- Affectively flattened and robotic demeanor may be incongruent with extreme emotional pain reported by individuals.
- Impairment in interpersonal and occupational spheres due to hypoemotionality, difficulty focusing/retaining information, and disconnectedness from life.

###### Differential Diagnosis of Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder

**Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder**

**Characteristics**:
- Presence of a constellation of typical depersonalization/derealization symptoms
- Absence of other manifestations of illness anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, dissociative disorders (e.g., dissociative identity disorder), anxiety disorders (except panic attacks), psychotic disorders, substance/medication-induced disorders, or mental disorders due to another medical condition

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- **Illness Anxiety Disorder**: Individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder can present with vague somatic complaints and fears of permanent brain damage. However, the diagnosis requires a constellation of typical symptoms without other manifestations of illness anxiety disorder.
- **Major Depressive Disorder**: Feelings of numbness, deadness, apathy, and being in a dream are not uncommon in major depressive episodes but should be associated with further symptoms of the disorder to diagnose depersonalization/derealization disorder.
- **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder**: Some individuals may become obsessively preoccupied with their subjective experience or develop rituals checking on their symptoms, but other symptoms of OCD unrelated to depersonalization/derealization are not present.
- **Other Dissociative Disorders**: Depersonalization/derealization disorder should not be diagnosed when the symptoms occur in the context of another dissociative disorder (e.g., dissociative identity disorder).
- **Anxiety Disorders**: Panic attack symptoms, such as depersonalization/derealization, are more prominent than actual panic attacks to diagnose this disorder. If depersonalization/derealization continues after panic disorder remission or successful treatment, the diagnosis applies.
- **Psychotic Disorders**: Intact reality testing regarding depersonalization/derealization symptoms is essential to differentiate this disorder from psychotic disorders.
- **Substance/Medication-Induced Disorders**: Depersonalization/derealization associated with substance use or withdrawal should not be diagnosed as the primary presentation of this disorder if symptoms persist without further substance use.
- **Mental Disorders Due to Another Medical Condition**: Thorough medical and neurological evaluation, including laboratory studies, imaging, and other tests, may be necessary to rule out underlying conditions like seizure disorders.

**Comorbidity**:
- High lifetime comorbidities for unipolar depressive disorder and any anxiety disorder in a convenience sample of adults with depersonalization/derealization research studies
- Low comorbidity with posttraumatic stress disorder
- Commonly co-occurring personality disorders: avoidant, borderline, and obsessive-compulsive.

#### Other Specified Dissociative Disorder

**Dissociative Disorders**

**Other Specified Dissociative Disorder (300.15, F44.89)**
- **Chronic and recurrent syndromes of mixed dissociative symptoms**: Includes identity disturbance with less-than-marked discontinuities in sense of self and agency or alterations of identity or episodes of possession
- **Identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion**: Such as brainwashing, thought reform, indoctrination while captive, torture, long-term political imprisonment, recruitment by sects/cults or by terror organizations
- **Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events**: Characterized by constriction of consciousness; derealization; perceptual disturbances (e.g., time slowing, macropsia); micro-amnesias; transient stupor; and/or alterations in sensory-motor functioning
- **Dissociative trance**: Characterized by an acute narrowing or complete loss of awareness of immediate surroundings, manifested as profound unresponsiveness or insensitivity to environmental stimuli
- The "other specified" designation is used when the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for a specific dissociative disorder is recorded.

**Unspecified Dissociative Disorder (300.15, F44.9)**
- **Presentations with symptoms characteristic of a dissociative disorder** that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
- Used when the criteria are not met for any specific dissociative disorder and insufficient information is available to make a more specific diagnosis
- Includes presentations that may be diagnosed as "dissociative disorder not otherwise specified" (DDNOS) in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9).

### Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders

**Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders (SSRD)**
- New category in DSM-5 replacing "somatoform disorders" of DSM-IV
- Includes somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder), psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, factitious disorder, other specified SSRD, and unspecified SSRD.
- All disorders share the prominence of **somatic symptoms** associated with distress and impairment.
- Disorders are more useful for primary care and medical (non-psychiatric) clinicians.
- Somatic symptom disorder emphasizes diagnosis based on positive symptoms rather than absence of medical explanation.
- Incorporates affective, cognitive, and behavioral components to provide a comprehensive reflection of the clinical picture.

**Changes in SSRD from DSM-IV:**
- Previous term "somatoform disorders" was confusing and replaced by somatic symptom and related disorders.
- Overlap between diagnoses and lack of clarity about boundaries in DSM-IV.
- New classification reduces number of diagnoses and subcategories, recognizing overlap.
- **Medically unexplained symptoms** are a key feature but not the basis for diagnosis.
- Diagnosis should not be given solely because no medical explanation is demonstrated.
- Presence of medical diagnosis does not exclude comorbid mental disorder (e.g., somatic symptom and related disorders).
- New classification defines **somatic symptom disorder** based on positive symptoms, not just medically unexplained symptoms.

**Characteristics of SSRD:**
- Somatic symptoms may accompany other mental disorders like major depressive disorder or panic disorder.
- Some somatic symptom and related disorders can arise spontaneously with no clear cause.
- Anxiety disorders and depressive disorders can co-occur and increase severity, functional impairment, and treatment resistance.
- Various factors contribute to somatic symptom and related disorders: genetic/biological vulnerability, early trauma, learning experiences, cultural/social norms.
- Presentations may differ across cultures due to interactions between multiple factors within cultural contexts.
- Prominent focus on somatic concerns and initial presentation in medical rather than mental health care settings.

**Somatic Symptom Disorder vs. Illness Anxiety Disorder:**
- Somatic symptom disorder offers a more clinically useful method of characterizing individuals.
- Approximately 75% of those previously diagnosed with hypochondriasis are subsumed under somatic symptom disorder.
- However, about 25% of hypochondriasis cases have high health anxiety without somatic symptoms, and these individuals would not qualify for an anxiety disorder diagnosis.
- Illness anxiety disorder can be considered either in the SSRD section or as an anxiety disorder due to strong focus on somatic concerns and initial presentation in medical settings.

**Conversion Disorder:**
- Essential feature: neurological symptoms incompatible with neurological pathophysiology.
- Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions also included under SSRD.

**Factitious Disorder:**
- Persistent problems related to illness perception and identity.
- Most cases present with somatic symptoms and medical disease conviction, making it a part of the somatic symptom and related disorders.

#### Somatic Symptom Disorder

**Diagnostic Criteria for Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD) - F45.1**
- **Criterion A**: One or more distressing somatic symptoms causing disruption of daily life.
- Subtypes: With predominant pain, Persistent
- **Criterion B**: Excessive thoughts, feelings, behaviors related to somatic symptoms.
  - Disproportionate and persistent thoughts about seriousness of symptoms.
  - Persistently high anxiety about health or symptoms.
  - Excessive time and energy devoted to symptoms or health concerns.
- Specify current severity: Mild, Moderate, Severe
  * Two or more symptoms fulfilled with no severe one = Mild
  * Two or more symptoms fulfilled including multiple somatic complaints or one very severe symptom = Moderate
  - All symptoms and multiple somatic complaints = Severe

**Diagnostic Features of Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD)**
- Individuals may have numerous, current, distressing somatic symptoms.
  * Specific or nonspecific symptoms.
  * Normally interpreted as insignificant or no serious disease.
  * Unexplained symptoms do not exclude diagnosis.
- Symptoms associated with another medical condition but thoughts, feelings, behaviors are excessive (Criterion B).
  - High levels of worry about illness and health concerns.
  * Appraises symptoms as unduly threatening, harmful, or troublesome despite evidence to the contrary.
- Central role in individual's life; dominating interpersonal relationships.
- Impaired quality of life physically and mentally (severe cases may lead to invalidism).
- High level of medical care utilization with minimal relief from symptoms or exacerbation of presenting symptoms.
  * Seeking multiple doctors for same symptoms.
  * Unresponsive to medical interventions.
- Hypersensitivity to medication side effects.
- Associated features: cognitive (attention on somatic symptoms, fear, etc.) and behavioral (repeated checking, seeking help, avoidance).

**Supporting Diagnosis of Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD)**
- Cognitive features include attention focused on somatic symptoms and catastrophic interpretations.
- Associated behaviors: repeated bodily checking for abnormalities, frequent seeking of medical help and reassurance, avoidance of physical activity.
- Primarily presented to general medical health services rather than mental health services.
- Increased suicide risk associated with depression or independently.

###### Somatic Symptom Disorder: Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Impact on Health Status

**Somatic Symptom Disorder Prevalence and Characteristics:**
- Prevalence: Not known but higher than somatization disorder (<1%), lower than undifferentiated somatoform disorder (approx. 19%)
- General population: Around 5-7%, more common in females
- Older adults: Common to have numerous somatic symptoms and medical illnesses, focus on Criterion B for diagnosis
- Underdiagnosed in older adults due to normal aging or understandable worry about illness
- Children: Most common symptoms include recurrent abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, nausate; single prominent symptom more common than adults
- Parents' response to symptom important as it determines distress level and medical help seeking

**Risk Factors:**
- Temperamental: Negative affectivity (neuroticism) personality trait associated with high number of somatic symptoms
- Comorbid anxiety or depression common, can exacerbate symptoms and impairment
- Environmental: Few years of education, low socioeconomic status, recent stressful life events
- Persistent somatic symptoms: Demographic features (female sex, older age, fewer years of education, lower socioeconomic status, unemployment), reported history of sexual abuse or other childhood adversity, concurrent chronic physical illness or psychiatric disorder (depression, anxiety, persistent depressive disorder [dysthymia], panic), social stress, reinforcing social factors such as illness benefits
- Cognitive factors: Sensitization to pain, heightened attention to bodily sensations, attribution of symptoms to medical illness rather than psychological stress

**Culture-Related Issues:**
- High numbers of somatic symptoms found worldwide in various cultures with similar pattern and impact on impairment and treatment seeking
- Relationship between number of somatic symptoms and illness worry consistent across cultures
- Differences in somatic symptom presentation due to linguistic and cultural factors, described as "idioms of distress"
- Cultural differences in symptom attribution and explanation (family, work, environment stresses; general medical illness; suppression of anger and resentment; or culture-specific phenomena)
- Similar worldwide rates of seeking treatment for multiple somatic symptoms in general medical clinics.

**Functional Consequences:**
- Marked impairment of health status
- Individuals with severe somatic symptom disorder likely to have impaired health status scores more than 2 standard deviations below population norms.

###### Differentiating Somatic Symptom Disorder from Other Mental Health Conditions

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Consider other mental disorders as alternative or additional diagnoses if somatic symptoms are consistent
- If criteria for another disorder are met, both should be coded
- **Somatic symptom disorder**:
  - Presence of somatic symptoms does not exclude diagnosis if criteria are otherwise met
  - Symptoms may occur in acute episodes (e.g., panic disorder) or persistently (somatic symptom disorder)

**Other Medical Conditions**
- Somatic symptoms without clear etiology do not automatically indicate somatic symptom disorder
- Established medical disorders do not exclude diagnosis if criteria are met

**Comparison with Other Disorders**
- **Panic Disorder**: Acute episodes, focus on anxiety about health vs. more persistent symptoms in somatic symptom disorder
- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder**: Multiple worries, focus not primarily on health
- **Depressive Disorders**: Core depressive symptoms of low mood and anhedonia distinguish from somatic symptom disorder
- **Illness Anxiety Disorder**: Extensive worries without minimal or no somatic symptoms may indicate illness anxiety disorder
- **Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)**: Focus on loss of function vs. distress caused by symptoms in somatic symptom disorder
- **Delusional Disorder, Somatic Subtype**: Intensity and behavior stronger than in somatic symptom disorder
- **Body Dysmorphic Disorder**: Excessive concern about perceived defects in appearance vs. fear of underlying illness
- **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder**: Less intrusive ideas and associated behaviors aimed at reducing anxiety

**Comorbidity**
- High rates of comorbidity with medical disorders, anxiety, and depressive disorders
- Diagnose somatic symptom disorder when criteria are met but seek evidence for concurrent diagnoses

#### Illness Anxiety Disorder

**Illness Anxiety Disorder (IAD)**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- Preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness (Criterion A)
- Somatic symptoms are not present or mild, if present (Criterion B)
- High level of anxiety about health and easily alarmed about personal health status (Criterion C)
- Excessive health-related behaviors or maladaptive avoidance (Criteria D)
- Illness preoccupation has been present for at least 6 months (Criterion E)
- Not better explained by another mental disorder, such as somatic symptom disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or delusional disorder, somatic type (Criterion F)

**Specify**:
- Care-seeking type: Medical care is frequently used
- Care-avoidant type: Medical care is rarely used

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Individuals with IAD are often classified as having somatic symptom disorder
- IAD entails a preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious, undiagnosed medical illness
- If a physical sign or symptom is present, it may be a normal physiological sensation, benign and self-limited dysfunction, or bodily discomfort not generally considered indicative of disease
- If a diagnosable medical condition is present, the individual's anxiety and preoccupation are excessive and disproportionate to the severity of the condition
- Preoccupation with illness becomes a central feature of the individual's life, affecting daily activities, and may even result in invalidism
- Illness becomes a central topic of social discourse and a characteristic response to stressful life events
- Individuals exhibit excessive health-related behaviors or maladaptive avoidance

**Associated Features**:
- Individuals believe they are medically ill and encounter medical care more frequently than mental health settings
- Majority have extensive but unsatisfactory medical care, though some may be too anxious to seek medical attention
- Elevated rates of medical utilization but not more than general population
- Consult multiple physicians for the same problem and obtain repeatedly negative diagnostic test results
- Medical attention can lead to paradoxical exacerbation of anxiety or iatrogenic complications from tests and procedures
- Physicians may be dismissive, respond with frustration or hostility, which can result in a failure to diagnose a medical condition that is present.

###### "Understanding Illness Anxiety Disorder: Prevalence, Development, Risk Factors, and Impact"

**Illness Anxiety Disorder: Prevalence, Development, Risk Factors, Course Modifiers, Cultural Considerations, and Functional Consequences**

**Prevalence**:
- Estimates based on DSM-III and IV diagnosis of Hypochondriasis
- 1.3% to 10% 2-year prevalence in community surveys/population-based samples
- 3% to 8% 6-month/1-year prevalence in ambulatory medical populations
- Similar prevalence between males and females

**Development and Course**:
- Development: chronic, relapsing condition with early to middle adulthood onset
- Health-related anxiety increases with age in population-based samples
- Rare in children; may focus on memory loss in older individuals

**Risk Factors**:
- Sometimes precipitated by major life stress or serious but benign health threats
- History of childhood abuse or illness may predispose to development

**Course Modifiers**:
- Approximately one-third to one-half of cases have a transient form, associated with less psychiatric comorbidity, more medical comorbidity, and less severe illness anxiety disorder

**Cultural Considerations**:
- Diagnosis should be made cautiously in individuals whose ideas about disease align with culturally sanctioned beliefs
- Prevalence appears similar across diverse cultures but knowledge on phenomena is limited

**Functional Consequences**:
- Significant role impairment and decrements in physical function and health-related quality of life
- Health concerns interfere with relationships, disrupt family life, and damage occupational performance.

###### Differential Diagnosis of Illness Anxiety Disorder and Comorbidities

**Differential Diagnosis of Illness Anxiety Disorder**

**Medical Conditions**:
- Consideration of underlying medical conditions: neurological, endocrine, occult malignancies, and other diseases affecting multiple body systems
- Presence of a medical condition does not rule out coexisting Illness Anxiety Disorder (IAD)
- Health-related anxiety is disproportionate to the seriousness of the medical condition
- Transient preoccupations related to a medical condition do not constitute IAD

**Adjustment Disorders**:
- Health-related anxiety is a normal response to serious illness and is time-limited
- If health anxiety is severe, an **adjustment disorder** may be diagnosed
- Continuous persistence of disproportionate health-related anxiety for at least 6 months required to diagnose IAD

**Somatic Symptom Disorder**:
- Diagnosed when significant somatic symptoms are present
- Individuals with IAD have minimal somatic symptoms and are primarily concerned with the idea they are ill

**Anxiety Disorders**:
- **Generalized anxiety disorder**: Worry about multiple events, situations, or activities, only one of which may involve health
- **Panic disorder**: Individual may be concerned that panic attacks reflect a medical illness
- Health anxiety in IAD is more persistent and enduring than in anxiety disorders

**Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders**:
- Individuals with IAD may have intrusive thoughts about having a disease and associated compulsions (e.g., seeking reassurance)
- Preoccupations in IAD are usually focused on having a disease, whereas in OCD, the thoughts are intrusive and focused on fears of getting a disease in the future

**Major Depressive Disorder**:
- Some individuals with depression ruminate about their health and worry excessively about illness
- A separate diagnosis of IAD is not made if concerns occur only during major depressive episodes
- If excessive illness worry persists after remission, the diagnosis of IAD should be considered

**Psychotic Disorders**:
- Individuals with IAD are not delusional and can acknowledge the possibility that the feared disease is not present
- Concerns in IAD are plausible, unlike more bizarre somatic delusions in psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, delusional disorder, major depressive disorder with psychotic features)

**Comorbidity**:
- Exact comorbidities of IAD unknown
- Hypochondriasis co-occurs with anxiety disorders (GAD, panic disorder, OCD) and depression
- Approximately two-thirds of individuals with IAD are likely to have at least one other comorbid major mental disorder
- Individuals with IAD may have an elevated risk for somatic symptom disorder and personality disorders.

#### Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)

**Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **A. One or more symptoms of altered voluntary motor or sensory function**
- **B. Clinical findings provide evidence of incompatibility between the symptom and recognized neurological or medical conditions**
- **C. The symptom or deficit is not better explained by another medical or mental disorder**
- **D. The symptom or deficit causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning or warrants medical evaluation**

**Coding**:
- ICD-9-CM code: 300.11
- ICD-10-CM code depends on the symptom type (see below)

**Specify Symptom Type**:
- **With weakness or paralysis** (F44.4)
- **With abnormal movement** (e.g., tremor, dystonic movement, myoclonus, gait disorder) (F44.4)
- **With swallowing symptoms** (F44.4)
- **With speech symptom** (e.g., dysphonia, slurred speech) (F44.5)
- **With attacks or seizures** (F44.6)
- **With anesthesia or sensory loss** (F44.6)
- **With special sensory symptom** (e.g., visual, olfactory, or hearing distur­bance) (F44.7)
- **With mixed symptoms**

**Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)**:
- Acute episode: Symptoms present for less than 6 months
- Persistent: Symptoms occurring for 6 months or more
- With psychological stressor (specify stressor)
- Without psychologic stressor

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Functional (abnormal central nervous system functioning)
- Psychogenic (assumed etiology)
- May include weakness, paralysis, abnormal movements, gait abnormalities, altered or absent sensation, altered speech, and other symptoms
- Incompatibility with neurological disease shown through clinical findings, such as:
  - Hoover's sign
  - Positive findings on tremor entrainment test
  - Unresponsiveness during seizure-like episodes without electroencephalogram changes
  - Tubular visual field for visual symptoms
- Diagnosis based on overall clinical picture, not a single finding

**Associated Features Supporting the Diagnosis**:
- History of multiple similar somatic symptoms
- Onset associated with stress or trauma (psychological or physical)
- Dissociative symptoms such as depersonalization, derealization, and dissociative amnesia, particularly at symptom onset or during attacks
- Lack of intentional production of symptoms (lack of feigning) is not required for the diagnosis
- **Labelle indifference** (lack of concern about nature or implications of the symptom) can be associated with conversion disorder but is not specific to it
- **Secondary gain** (external benefits from symptoms) is not specific to conversion disorder and should not be used as the primary basis for the diagnosis

###### Conversion Disorder: Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Diagnostic Considerations

**Prevalence and Development**
- Transient conversion symptoms common but disorder prevalence unknown
- Diagnosis requires assessment in secondary care: approximately 5% of neurology clinic referrals
- Incidence of individual persistent symptoms: 2-5/100,000 per year
- Development throughout life course, onset peaks in third decade for non-epileptic attacks and fourth decade for motor symptoms
- Prognosis better in younger children than adolescents and adults

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**
- **Temperamental**: maladaptive personality traits commonly associated with conversion disorder
- **Environmental**: history of childhood abuse, neglect; stressful life events present but not always
- **Genetic and physiological**: presence of neurological disease causing similar symptoms a risk factor (e.g., non-epileptic seizmes in patients with epilepsy)
- **Course modifiers**: short duration of symptoms and acceptance of diagnosis positive; maladaptive personality traits, comorbid physical disease, receipt of disability benefits negative

**Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues**
- Symptoms explained within cultural context without clinically significant distress or disability: no conversion disorder diagnosis made

**Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues**
- Conversion disorder two to three times more common in females

**Functional Consistencies of Conversion Disorder**
- Individuals with conversion symptoms may have substantial disability, similar severity as individuals with comparable medical diseases

**Differential Diagnosis**
- If another mental disorder better explains the symptoms, that diagnosis should be made
- Conversion disorder may be diagnosed in the presence of another mental disorder, but neurological disease should be ruled out first.

###### Differentiating Conversion Disorder from Other Neurological and Psychological Conditions

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- **Neurological Disease**: Uncommon cause for symptoms after thorough assessment
- Unexpected neurological disease: Rarely found at follow up if symptoms appear stable
- Reassessment may be required if symptoms progress
- Conversion disorder can coexist with neurological disease

**Somatic Symptom Disorder vs. Conversion Disorder:**
- **Somatic Symptom Disorder**: Cannot be demonstrated to be incompatible with pathophysiology (e.g., pain, fatigue)
- Incompatibility required for conversion disorder diagnosis
- Excessive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors absent in conversion disorder

**Factitious Disorder and Malingering:**
- Conversion disorder diagnosis does not require judgment of conscious intention
- Clear evidence of feigning suggests factitious disorder or malingering

**Dissociative Symptoms:**
- Common in individuals with conversion disorder
- Both diagnoses should be made if present

**Body Dysmorphic Disorder:**
- Individuals have excessive concerns about physical features but no symptoms of sensory or motor functioning in affected body part

**Depressive Disorders:**
- General heaviness vs. more focal weakness in conversion disorder
- Core depressive symptoms present in depressive disorders

**Panic Disorder:**
- Transient neurological symptoms with characteristic cardiorespiratory symptoms in panic attacks
- Loss of awareness and amnesia for the attack in non-epileptic attacks, not in panic attacks

**Comorbid Conditions:**
- Anxiety disorders (especially panic disorder) and depressive disorders commonly coexist with conversion disorder
- Somatic symptom disorder may also coexist
- Psychosis, substance use disorder, alcohol misuse uncommon
- Personality disorders more common in individuals with conversion disorder than general population.

###### Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions

**Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (F54)**

**Criteria**:
- **A**: Medical symptom or condition (other than a mental disorder) is present
- **B**: Psychological or behavioral factors adversely affect the medical condition in one of four ways:
  - Close temporal association between psychological factors and development/exacerbation/delayed recovery from medical condition
  - Interfere with treatment of medical condition (e.g., poor adherence)
  - Constitute additional health risks for the individual
  - Influence underlying pathophysiology, precipitating or exacerbating symptoms/requiring medical attention
- **C**: Psychological and behavioral factors in Criterion B are not better explained by another mental disorder

**Specify Current Severity**:
- Mild: Increases medical risk (e.g., inconsistent adherence to antihypertension treatment)
- Moderate: Aggravates underlying medical condition (e.g., anxiety aggravating asthma)
- Severe: Results in medical hospitalization or emergency room visit
- Extreme: Results in severe, life-threatening risk (e.g., ignoring heart attack symptoms)

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Presence of clinically significant psychological or behavioral factors that adversely affect a medical condition by increasing risk for suffering, death, or disability (Criterion B)
- Psychological or behavioral factors can influence course/treatment, constitute additional health risks, or influence underlying pathophysiology
- Examples: Anxiety exacerbating asthma, denial of need for treatment, manipulation of insulin by an individual with diabetes
- Effects can range from acute (immediate medical consequences) to chronic (long-term effects)
- Affected medical conditions can be those with clear pathophysiology or functional syndromes/idiopathic symptoms

**Notes**:
- Diagnosis should be reserved for situations where the effect of psychological factors on medical condition is evident and clinically significant
- Evidence of association between psychological factors and medical condition, although causality and mechanisms may not be demonstrated.

###### Psychological Factors Impact on Multiple Medical Conditions

**Prevalence of Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions**
- Unclear prevalence
- More common diagnosis than somatic symptom disorders in U.S. private insurance billing data
- Occur across the lifespan, with young children requiring corroborative history from parents or school for diagnostic evaluation
- Particularly evident in older individuals as stressors like caregiving can exacerbate medical conditions

**Cultural Considerations**
- Influence on psychological factors and their effects on medical conditions: language and communication style, explanatory models of illness, patterns of seeking healthcare, service availability and organization, doctor-patient relationships, family and gender roles, attitudes toward pain and death
- Differentiation from culturally specific behaviors: acceptable within a culture, do not adversely affect outcomes, should not be pathologized as psychological factors affecting other medical conditions

**Functional Consequences of Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions**
- Demonstrated to impact course of various medical diseases

###### Differential Diagnosis: Mental Disorders Due to Medical Conditions

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- **Mental disorder due to another medical condition**: Temporal association between mental disorder symptoms and those of a medical condition. Presumed causality is in the opposite direction, with the medical condition causing the mental disorder through a direct physiological mechanism.
- **Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions**: Psychological or behavioral factors affecting the course of a medical condition. Distinguished from adjustment disorders and somatic symptom disorder by emphasis on exacerbation of medical condition versus maladaptive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
- **Adjustment disorders:** Abnormal psychological or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor, such as anxiety about angina.
- **Somatic symptom disorder**: Combination of distressing somatic symptoms and excessive or maladaptive thoughts, feelings, and behavior in response to these symptoms or associated health concerns. Emphasis on maladaptive behaviors rather than exacerbation of medical condition.
- **Illness anxiety disorder**: High illness anxiety that is distressing and disruptive to daily life with minimal somatic symptoms. Focus is the individual's worry about having a disease, as no serious disease may be present.

**Factitious Disorder:**
- **Criteria for Factitious Disorder**: Falsification or induction of illness or injury associated with identified deception. The individual presents himself or herself as ill, impaired, or injured, and the behavior is evident even in the absence of obvious external rewards. It is not better explained by another mental disorder such as delusional disorder or psychotic disorder.
- **Specify:** Single episode or recurrent episodes (two or more events of falsification of illness and/or induction of injury).

#### Factitious Disorder

**Factitious Disorder (Imposed on Another)**

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Falsification of physical or psychological signs or symptoms, or induction of injury/disease in another
- Individual presents another as ill, impaired, or injured to others
- Deceptive behavior evident without external rewards
- Not explained by other mental disorders (delusional disorder, psychotic disorder)

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- **A. Falsification of signs and symptoms:** Exaggeration, fabrication, simulation, induction
- **B. Presenting another as ill:** Deceives others into believing the victim is more ill or impaired
- **C. Absence of external rewards:** Behavior not driven by obvious rewards

**Subtypes:**
- Single episode
- Recurrent episodes (two or more)

**Recording Procedures:**
- Diagnosis given to perpetrator, not victim
- Victim may receive abuse diagnosis if applicable

**Associated Features:**
- Psychological distress for individual and others involved
- Similarities to substance use disorders, eating disorders, impulse control disorders, pedophilic disorder, etc.
- Criminal behavior (factitious disorder imposed on another)

**Emphasis:**
- Objective identification of falsification of signs/symptoms
- Deception associated with induced injury or disease.

###### Factitious Disorder: Characteristics and Progression in Hospital Settings

**Factitious Disorder:**
- Prevalence unknown due to deception involved
- Estimated 1% of individuals in hospital settings have presentations that meet criteria
- Course: intermittent episodes or persistent and unremitting (less common)
- Onset: usually early adulthood, often after medical condition or mental disorder diagnosis
- May begin after hospitalization of a dependent, such as child
- In individuals with recurrent episodes: successive deceptive contact with medical personnel including hospitalizations may become lifelong.

###### Factitious Disorders: Distinguishing Characteristics and Associated Conditions

**Differential Diagnosis of Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another**

**Factitious Disorder vs. Protection from Liability**:
- Caregivers who lie to protect themselves without obvious external rewards are not diagnosed with factitious disorder
- Those who lie extensively beyond immediate self-protection are diagnosed with factitious disorder

**Somatic Symptom Disorder vs. Factitious Disorder**:
- Somatic symptom disorder: Excessive attention and treatment seeking for perceived medical concerns without deception
- Factitious disorder: Deceptive falsification of symptoms, absent obvious rewards

**Malingering vs. Factitious Disorder**:
- Malingering: Reporting symptoms intentionally for personal gain (e.g., money, time off work)
- Factitious disorder: No obvious rewards

**Conversion Disorder vs. Factitious Disorder**:
- Conversion disorder: Neurological symptoms inconsistent with neurological pathophysiology
- Factitious disorder with neurological symptoms: Deceptive falsification of symptoms

**Borderline Personality Disorder vs. Factitious Disorder**:
- Deliberate physical self-harm in absence of suicidal intent can occur with borderline personality disorder
- Factitious disorder requires deception and induction of injury

**Medical Condition or Mental Disorder vs. Factitious Disorder**:
- Presence of a medical condition or mental disorder does not exclude factitious disorder
- Factitious disorder may involve comorbid illness

#### Other Specified Somatic Symptom and Related Disorder

**Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders (SSRD)**

**300.89 (F45.8) - Other Specified SSRD:**
- This category applies to presentations with symptoms characteristic of a somatic symptom disorder but not meeting full criteria for any specific diagnosis in the SSRD diagnostic class.
- Examples:
  * **Brief somatic symptom disorder**: Symptoms duration is less than 6 months.
  * **Brief illness anxiety disorder**: Symptoms duration is less than 6 months.
  * **Illness anxiety disorder without excessive health-related behaviors**: Criterion D for illness anxiety disorder not met.
  * **Pseudocyesis**: False belief of being pregnant with objective signs and reported symptoms of pregnancy.

**300.82 (F45.9) - Unspecified Somatic Symptom and Related Disorder:**
- This category is used when symptoms characteristic of a somatic symptom disorder cause clinically significant distress or impairment but do not meet the full criteria for any specific diagnosis in the SSRD diagnostic class.
- The unspecified SSRD should only be used when there are unusual situations with insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

### Feeding and Eating Disorders

**Feeding and Eating Disorders**

**Characteristics**: Persistent disturbance of eating behavior that impairs physical health or psychosocial functioning. Diagnoses include:
- Pica: Present with any other feeding disorder
- Rumination disorder
- Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ANI)
- Anorexia nervosa
- Bulimia nervosa
- Binge-eating disorder

**Diagnostic Criteria**: Mutually exclusive classification scheme, only one diagnosis per episode. Differences in clinical course, outcome, and treatment needs.

**Shared Features with Substance Use Disorders**: Similarities may reflect involvement of the same neural systems (regulatory self-control and reward). Contributions to development and perpetuation insufficiently understood.

**Obesity**: Not considered a mental disorder in DSM-5; results from long-term excess energy intake vs. expenditure. Caused by genetic, physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors. Associations with various mental disorders (e.g., binge eating, depression, schizophrenia). Side effects of some psychotropic medications can contribute to development; obesity may be a risk factor for certain mental disorders.

#### Pica

**Pica Diagnostic Criteria**
* **A.** Persistent eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances for at least 1 month:
  * Inappropriate to developmental level
  * Not part of culturally supported or socially normative practice
* **B.** Developmentally inappropriate and not a culturally accepted practice
* **C.** Identified in individuals from age 2 and above, excluding normal infant mouthing behavior
* **D.** If occurring with another mental disorder or medical condition, severe enough to require additional attention

**Diagnostic Features**
* Essential feature: Persistent eating of nonnutritive substances for at least a month (Criteria A-C)
* Typical substances: Paper, soap, cloth, hair, etc. (not diet products with minimal nutritional content)
* No aversion to food in general
* Variation with age and availability
* Coding: ICD-9-CM - 307.52 for children or adults; ICD-10-CM - F98.3 for children, F50.8 for adults

**Associated Features and Supporting Diagnosis**
* No specific biological abnormalities often found
* Complications: Mechanical bowel problems, intestinal obstruction, infection, poisoning (Criteria D)
* Deficiencies in vitamins or minerals reported sometimes.

###### Understanding Pica: Diagnosis, Comorbidities, and Differential Diagnoses

**Prevalence of Pica:**
- Unclear prevalence among individuals with intellectual disability
- Increases with severity of condition
- Can occur in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood (mostly reported in children)
- Diagnosis appropriate during pregnancy if cravings lead to medical risks
- Protracted course, may result in medical emergencies or be fatal

**Risk Factors:**
- Environmental: neglect, lack of supervision, developmental delay
- Cultural practices do not warrant diagnosis if not persistent and severe

**Gender:**
- Occurs in both males and females
- More common in individuals with intellectual disability or mental disorders during adulthood
- Can occur in pregnancy, but little known about postpartum period

**Diagnostic Markers:**
- Abdominal radiography, ultrasound, scanning methods to detect obstructions
- Blood tests, laboratory tests for poisoning or infection

**Functional Consequences:**
- Impairs physical functioning but rarely sole cause of social impairment
- Often occurs with other disorders (autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability)

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Anorexia nervosa: consumption of nonnutritive substances is a distinguishing factor
- Factitious disorder: element of deception and deliberate injury induction
- Self-injury behaviors in personality disorders: intentionally swallowing harmful items, but not pica

**Comorbidities:**
- Most common comorbidities: autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability
- Less frequently associated with schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder
- Can be linked to trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder), excoriation (skin picking) disorder, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.

#### Rumination Disorder

**Rumination Disorder**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **Criterion A**: Repeated regurgitation of food over a period of at least 1 month
- **Criterion B**: Regurgitated food is not attributable to an associated gastrointestinal or other medical condition
- **Criterion C**: Eating disturbance does not occur exclusively during anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder
- **Criterion D**: If symptoms occur in the context of another mental disorder, they are sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical attention

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Essential feature: Repeated regurgitation after feeding or eating for at least 1 month
- Previously swallowed food brought up into the mouth without nausea, involuntary retching, or disgust
- Regurgitation frequent, occurring at least several times per week, typically daily
- Not explained by an associated gastrointestinal or other medical condition
- Does not occur exclusively during anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder

**Associated Features**:
- Individuals may be irritable and hungry between episodes of regurgitation
- Weight loss and failure to make expected weight gains are common, particularly in infants
- Malnutrition may occur despite apparent hunger and large food ingestion
- Adolescents and adults may disguise the behavior by placing a hand over the mouth or coughing
- Some individuals avoid eating with others due to the socially undesirable behavior.

###### Rumination Disorder in Infancy and Beyond: Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment

**Rumination Disorder:**
* Prevalence: inconclusive but higher in individuals with intellectual disability
* Onset: infancy to adulthood, most common in infants aged 3-12 months
* Course: episodic or continuous until treated
* Self-soothing function for some individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders
* Environmental factors: lack of stimulation, neglect, stressful life situations, and problems in parent-child relationship
* Consequences: malnutrition, growth delay, negative impact on development and learning potential, weight loss or low weight (older individuals)
* Differential diagnosis: gastroesophageal reflux disorders, vomiting conditions like gastroparesis, pyloric stenosis, hiatal hernia, Sandifer syndrome, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and other mental disorders.
* Comorbidity: can occur with concurrent medical conditions or other mental disorders but only diagnosed as rumination disorder when severity warrants additional clinical attention.

#### Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder

**Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **307.59 (F50.8)**: Diagnosis code for ARFID

**Criteria A: Eating or Feeding Disturbance**:
- Apparent lack of interest in eating or food
- Avoidance based on sensory characteristics of food
- Concern about aversive consequences of eating
- Persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or energy needs

**Criteria B, C, D: Exclusions**:
- Not better explained by lack of available food or cultural practices
- Not exclusively during anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa
- No evidence of disturbance in body weight or shape experience
- Not attributable to concurrent medical condition or mental disorder

**Criteria A: Significant Weight Loss/Failure to Gain**:
- Weight loss or failure to maintain expected weight gain
- Faltering growth in children

**Criteria A: Nutritional Deficiency**:
- Significant nutritional deficiency
- Related health impact (e.g., hypothermia, bradycardia, anemia)
- Malnutrition can be life-threatening, particularly in infants

**Criteria A: Dependence on Enteral/Oral Nutritional Supplements**:
- Dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements to sustain adequate intake
- Examples: Infants with failure to thrive, neurodevelopmental disorders

**Criteria A: Marked Interference with Psychosocial Functioning**:
- Inability to participate in normal social activities
- Sustain relationships due to the disturbance

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Replaces and extends the DSM-IV diagnosis of **feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood**
- Main diagnostic feature: Avoidance/restriction of food intake
- One or more key features must be present (significant weight loss, nutritional deficiency, dependence on supplements, psychosocial interference)

**Associated Features**:
- Lack of interest in eating or food
- Irritable and difficult to console during feeding
- Emotional difficulties (not meeting diagnostic criteria for anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder)
- Developmental delays and learning potential impairment in infants/children
- Social functioning adversely affected in all ages
- Family function affected, with heightened stress at mealtimes

**Development and Course**:
- Most commonly develops in infancy or early childhood
- Can persist into adulthood
- Stability and long-standing nature is relatively stable
- Insufficient evidence linking ARFID and subsequent onset of eating disorder
- Triggers for presentation vary (physical, social, emotional)

###### Risk Factors and Diagnosis of Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder

**Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder**

**Risk Factors**:
- **Anxiety disorders**, autism spectrum disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder may increase risk for avoidant or restrictive feeding/eating behavior characteristic of the disorder
- **Environmental risk factors**:
  - Familial anxiety: Higher rates of feeding disturbances occur in children of mothers with eating disorders
- **Genetic and physiological**:
  - History of gastrointestinal conditions, gastroesophageal reflux disease, vomiting, and a range of other medical problems associated with feeding/eating behaviors characteristic of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder

**Diagnostic Issues**:
- **Culture-related diagnostic issues**: Avoidance of food intake should not be diagnosed as the disorder if it is solely related to specific religious or cultural practices
- **Gender differences**:
  - Equally common in males and females in infancy and early childhood
  - Comorbid with autism spectrum disorder has a male predominance
  - Food avoidance/restriction related to altered sensory sensitivities can occur in some physiological conditions, but is not extreme and does not meet full criteria for the disorder

**Diagnostic Markers**:
- Malnutrition, low weight, growth delay, and need for artificial nutrition in the absence of clear medical condition other than poor intake

**Functional Consequences**:
- Impairment of physical development and social difficulties that can have a significant negative impact on family function

**Differentiation from Other Disorders**:
- **Appetite loss preceding restricted intake** is a nonspecific symptom that can accompany many mental diagnoses
- Can be diagnosed concurrently with other medical conditions, but requires that the eating disturbance be the primary focus of intervention
- Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder cannot be diagnosed when avoidance/restriction is solely related to **specific religious or cultural practices**

**Associated Conditions**:
- **Reactive attachment disorder**: Withdrawal can lead to a disturbance in the caregiver-child relationship affecting feeding and the child's intake
- **Autism spectrum disorder**: Individuals may present with rigid eating behaviors and heightened sensory sensitivities, but these features do not always result in level of impairment for diagnosis
- **Anorexia nervosa**: Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to significantly low body weight is a core feature, while individuals with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder display no such features

###### Differential Diagnosis of Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Difficult to distinguish between avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and anorexia nervosa (AN), especially in late childhood and early adolescence due to shared symptoms like food avoidance and low weight
- Consideration of symptoms, course, and family history is advised for diagnosis
- ARFID may precede AN onset

**Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):**
- Individuals with OCD might present with avoidance or restriction of intake related to food preoccupations or ritualized eating behavior
- Diagnose both disorders if all criteria are met and eating disturbance requires specific intervention

**Major Depressive Disorder:**
- Appetite affected, leading to restricted food intake and weight loss
- Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should only be used concurrently when full criteria are met for both disorders and if the eating disturbance necessitates treatment

**Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders:**
- Individuals may exhibit odd eating behaviors or avoid specific foods due to delusional beliefs
- Diagnose both disorders only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when necessary for treatment

**Factitious Disorder or Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another:**
- Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be differentiated from factitious disorder and factitious disorder imposed on another
- Careful assessment of affected individual, caregiver, and their interaction is necessary before diagnosis.

**Comorbidities:**
- Commonly observed comorbidities with ARFID include anxiety disorders, OCD, neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).

#### Anorexia Nervosa

**Anorexia Nervosa**
- **Diagnostic Criteria**:
  - **A. Restriction of energy intake**: leading to significantly low body weight
    - Significantly low weight: less than minimally normal or expected for age, sex, developmental trajectory, physical health
  - **B. Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat** or behavior interfering with weight gain
  - **C. Disturbance in self-perception of body weight or shape**, undue influence on self-evaluation, lack of recognition of low weight's seriousness
- **ICD Codes**:
  - ICD-9-CM: 307.1 (assigned regardless of subtype)
  - ICD-10-CM: varies by subtype (see below)
- **Specify Subtype**:
  - **F50.01 Restricting type**: no recent binge eating or purging behavior (self-induced vomiting, laxatives, diuretics, or enemas)
    - Weight loss through dieting, fasting, excessive exercise
  - **F50.02 Binge-eating/purging type**: recurrent episodes of binge eating and purging (self-induced vomiting, laxatives, diuretics, or enemas)
    - Individuals with this subtype may also restrict their food intake
    - Crossover between subtypes is common, describe current symptoms rather than longitudinal course
- **Remission Status**:
  - **In partial remission**: no longer meet full criteria for anorexia nervosa, but still exhibit some symptoms (B or C)
  - **In full remission**: no longer meet any criteria for anorexia nervosa
- **Current Severity Level**:
  - Minimum severity based on Body Mass Index (BMI) or BMI percentile (for children and adolescents)
  - Levels: Mild, Moderate, Severe, Extreme

###### Diagnostic Features and Associated Symptoms of Anorexia Nervosa

**Anorexia Nervosa: Diagnostic Features**

**Three Essential Features:**
- **Persistent energy intake restriction**
- **Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat** (Criterion B)
- **Disturbance in self-perceived weight or shape** (Criterion C)

**Weight Criteria:**
- Individuals maintain a body weight below minimally normal level for age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health (Criterion A)
  - Weight assessment can be challenging due to individual differences in body builds and weight histories.
  - Body mass index (BMI) is a useful measure:
    * Adults: BMI of less than 18.5 kg/m2 is considered low weight, while a BMI below 17.0 kg/m2 indicates moderate to severe thinness.
    * Children and adolescents: Determining a BMI-for-age percentile is useful; CDC uses below the 5th percentile as underweight.

**Behavioral Features:**
- Intense fear of weight gain may not be alleviated by weight loss
- Preoccupation with body size and shape
- Distorted self-perception of weight and body parts (Criterion C)

**Associated Features:**
- Amenorrhea and vital sign abnormalities are common
- Laboratory findings can indicate behaviors like self-induced vomiting or laxative use
- Depressive symptoms, obsessive-compulsive behaviors related to food may be present (can also indicate other disorders)
- Other symptoms: excessive physical activity, inflexible thinking, limited social spontaneity, overly restrained emotional expression.

**Impulse Control:**
- Increased rates of impulsivity and substance abuse among individuals with binge-eating/purging type anorexia nervosa
- Excessive levels of physical activity may be difficult to control during treatment and jeopardize weight recovery

**Medication Misuse:**
- Individuals may manipulate medication dosages or omit insulin to achieve weight loss or avoid weight gain.

###### Anorexia Nervosa: Epidemiology, Diagnosis, and Functional Consequences

**Anorexia Nervosa:**

**Prevalence**
- Approximately 0.4% 12-month prevalence among young females
- Less common in males, with a 10:1 female-to-male ratio in clinical populations
- Onset often associated with stressful life events, such as leaving home for college

**Course and Outcome**
- Highly variable course and outcome
- Younger individuals may exhibit atypical features (denying "fear of fat")
- Older individuals more likely to have a longer duration of illness and signs/symptoms of long-standing disorder
- Some recover fully, others experience relapse or chronic course over years

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**
- Anxiety disorders or obsessional traits in childhood increase risk
- Cultural and societal factors (valuing thinness) contribute to risk
- Genetic and physiological factors also play a role
- Increased risk of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa among first-degree relatives
- Brain abnormalities observed using functional imaging technologies

**Diagnostic Markers**
- Laboratory abnormalities: leukopenia, mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, metabolic alkalosis, hypochloremia, and hypokalemia (from self-induced vomiting); laxative abuse may cause a mild metabolic acidosis
- Hepatic enzyme levels and electrolyte disturbances common
- Serum T4 low, T3 decreased, reverse T3 elevated; females have low estrogen levels, males have low testosterone levels
- Sinus bradycardia and arrhythmias (rarely)
- Low bone mineral density with osteopenia or osteoporosis
- Significant reduction in resting energy expenditure

**Physical Signs and Symptoms**
- Amenorrhea commonly present, indicating physiological dysfunction
- Menarche may be delayed in prepubertal females
- Complaints of constipation, abdominal pain, cold intolerance, lethargy, and excess energy
- Emaciation is the most remarkable finding on physical examination
- Hypotension, hypothermia, bradycardia, lanugo, peripheral edema (rarely), petechiae or ecchymoses, yellowing of skin (hypercarotenemia)

**Suicide Risk**
- Elevated suicide risk with rates reported as 12 per 100,000 per year
- Comprehensive evaluation necessary for assessing suicide ideation and behaviors.

###### Differential Diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa and Related Disorders

**Differential Diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa**

**Atypical Presenting Features**: Consider other possible causes when body weight is significantly low or there is significant weight loss:
- **Medical Conditions:** Gastrointestinal disease, hyperthyroidism, occult malignancies, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
  - Weight loss may occur without disturbance in body weight/shape experience or intense fear of weight gain
  - Acute weight loss can be followed by onset or recurrence of anorexia nervosa
  - Rare development after bariatric surgery for obesity
- **Major Depressive Disorder**
  - Severe weight loss but no desire for excessive weight loss or intense fear of gaining weight
- **Schizophrenia**: Odd eating behavior, occasional significant weight loss
  - Rarely manifests fear of weight gain and body image disturbance required for anorexia nervosa diagnosis
- **Substance Use Disorders**
  - Low weight due to poor nutritional intake
  - Generally do not fear gaining weight or exhibit body image disturbance
- **Substance Abuse**: Individuals who abuse appetite-reducing substances and endorse fear of weight gain should be carefully evaluated
- **Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Body Dysmorphic Disorder**
  - Some features overlap with anorexia nervosa
  - If social fears limited to eating behavior alone, diagnosis of social phobia should not be made
  - Additional diagnoses for unrelated issues may apply
- **Bulimia Nervosa**: Recurrent binge eating, inappropriate behaviors to avoid weight gain, overly concerned with body shape and weight
  - Individuals maintain normal or above normal body weight
- **Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder**
  - Significant weight loss or nutritional deficiency without fear of gaining weight or body image disturbance

**Comorbidities**:
- Bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders commonly co-occur with anorexia nervosa
- Anxiety disorder symptoms may precede eating disorder onset
- OCD can occur in individuals with the restricting type of anorexia nervosa
- Alcohol use disorder and other substance use disorders may be comorbid, especially with binge-eating/purging type.

#### Bulimia Nervosa
**Bulimia Nervosa Diagnostic Criteria (F50.2)**

**A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating:**
- Eating an amount larger than most individuals under similar circumstances within a discrete period of time
- Sense of lack of control during the episode

**B. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors:**
- Self-induced vomiting
- Misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications
- Fasting
- Excessive exercise

**C. Occurrence:**
- Both binge eating and compensatory behaviors occur, on average, at least once a week for 3 months

**D. Self-evaluation:**
- Unduly influenced by body shape and weight

**E. Exclusivity:**
- Does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa

**Specifiers:**
- In partial remission: Some, but not all, criteria have been met for a sustained period of time
- In full remission: No criteria have been met for a sustained period of time

**Current severity:**
- Mild: 1-3 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week
- Moderate: 4-7 episodes per week
- Severe: 8-13 episodes per week
- Extreme: 14 or more episodes per week

###### Bulimia Nervosa: Prevalence, Diagnosis, and Functional Consequences

**Bulimia Nervosa:**

**Prevalence**:
- Twelve-month prevalence among young females: 1%-1.5%
- Highest point prevalence in older adolescence and young adulthood
- Less known about point prevalence in males, but far less common with a 10:1 female-to-male ratio

**Development and Course**:
- Commonly begins in adolescence or young adulthood, uncommon before puberty or after age 40
- Binge eating often starts during/after dieting to lose weight
- Disturbed eating behavior persists for several years in many cases
- Course can be chronic or intermittent with periods of remission and recurrences
- Long-term outcomes are better with longer periods of remission (>1 year)
- Significantly elevated risk for mortality (all-cause and suicide): 2% per decade
- Diagnostic crossover to anorexia nervosa: 10-15%
- Some individuals may have binge eating without inappropriate compensatory behaviors, meeting criteria for binge-eating disorder or other specified eating disorder

**Risk Factors**:
- Temperamental: weight concerns, low self-esteem, depressive symptoms, social anxiety disorder, overanxious disorder of childhood
- Environmental: internalization of thin body ideal leading to weight concerns and increased risk for bulimia nervosa
- Genetic and physiological: childhood obesity, early pubertal maturation, familial transmission, genetic vulnerabilities
- Culture-related diagnostic issues: similar prevalence in industrialized countries, primarily white females in clinical samples but also occurs in other ethnic groups with comparable prevalence

**Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues**:
- Much more common in females than males
- Underrepresentation of males in treatment-seeking samples, reasons not yet systematically examined

**Diagnostic Markers**:
- No specific diagnostic test for bulimia nervosa
- Laboratory abnormalities: fluid and electrolyte imbalances, metabolic alkalosis or acidosis, elevated serum amylase
- Physical examination typically yields no findings, but inspection of the mouth may reveal tooth enamel loss, increased dental caries, or salivary gland enlargement
- Manual stimulation of the gag reflex can lead to calluses/scars on the back of the hands
- Serious cardiac and skeletal myopathies have been reported in some individuals using ipecac to induce vomiting

**Suicide Risk**:
- Elevated suicide risk for individuals with bulimia nervosa
- Comprehensive evaluation should include assessment of suicide ideation and behaviors as well as other suicide risk factors

**Functional Consequences**:
- A minority of individuals report severe role impairment, primarily in the social life domain.

###### Diagnosing Bulimia Nervosa and Associated Conditions

**Differential Diagnosis:**

**Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-Eating/Purging Type**:
- Individuals whose binge-eating behavior occurs only during episodes of anorexia nervosa are given this diagnosis
- Should not be given additional diagnosis of bulimia nervosa
- For individuals with initial diagnosis of anorexia nervosa who binge and purge, but weight is normal, a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa should be given only when all criteria have been met for at least 3 months

**Binge-Eating Disorder**:
- Some individuals binge eat but do not engage in regular inappropriate compensatory behaviors
- Diagnosis of **binge-eating disorder** should be considered

**Kleine-Levin Syndrome**:
- Disturbed eating behavior, but characteristic psychological features of bulimia nervosa are not present

**Major Depressive Disorder, with Atypical Features**:
- Overeating is common, but individuals do not engage in inappropriate compensatory behaviors or excessive concern with body shape and weight
- If criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses should be given

**Borderline Personality Disorder**:
- Binge-eating behavior is included in impulsive behavior criterion of borderline personality disorder definition
- If criteria for both borderline personality disorder and bulimia nervosa are met, both diagnoses should be given

**Comorbidity**:
- Comorbidity with mental disorders is common in individuals with bulimia nervosa
- Most experience at least one other mental disorder and many experience multiple comorbidities
- Increased frequency of:
  - Depressive symptoms (e.g., low self-esteem) and bipolar and depressive disorders, particularly depressive disorders
  - Mood disturbances often begin around the same time as or following bulimia nervosa onset
  - Frequency of anxiety symptoms (e.g., fear of social situations) or anxiety disorders
- Lifetime prevalence of substance use, particularly alcohol or stimulant use, is at least 30%
- Stimulant use may begin to control appetite and weight
- Substantial percentage of individuals with bulimia nervosa have personality features meeting criteria for one or more personality disorders, most frequently borderline personality disorder.

#### Binge-Eating Disorder

**Binge-Eating Disorder (F50.8)**

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- Recurrent episodes of **binge eating** (at least once weekly for 3 months)
  - Episodes characterized by:
    * Eating a large amount of food in a short period of time
    * Sense of lack of control during the episode

**Associated Features:**
- Eating much more rapidly than normal
- Eating until feeling uncomfortably full
- Eating large amounts when not physically hungry
- Eating alone due to embarrassment
- Feeling disgusted, depressed, or guilty afterward

**Distress and Severity:**
- Marked distress regarding binge eating
- Mild, Moderate, Severe, Extreme based on frequency of episodes (1-3, 4-7, 8-13, 14+ per week)

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Recurrent binge eating with loss of control over eating
- Variable type and quantity of food consumed during binges
- Marked distress and embarrassment
- Secretive behavior to conceal symptoms
- Triggers: negative affect, interpersonal stressors, dietary restraint, body image issues, boredom

**Support for Diagnosis:**
- Binge-eating disorder occurs in normal weight/overweight and obese individuals
- Distinct from obesity as not all obese people engage in recurrent binge eating
- Associated with greater functional impairment, lower quality of life, more subjective distress, and psychiatric comorbidities compared to weight-matched non-binge eaters.

###### Binge Eating Disorder: Prevalence, Diagnosis, and Comorbidities

**Prevalence of Binge-Eating Disorder**
* **12-month prevalence**: 1.6% females, 0.8% males (less skewed than bulimia nervosa)
* Prevalent among minorities as much as whites
* More common in those seeking weight loss treatment

**Development and Course of Binge-Eating Disorder**
* Onset: adolescence or young adulthood but can begin later
* Typically begins before bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa
* Higher remission rates than other eating disorders
* Persistent course comparable to bulimia nervosa
* Uncommon crossover to other eating disorders

**Risk and Prognostic Factors for Binge-Eating Disorder**
* Genetic and physiological influences
* No clear cultural differences in prevalence or presentation

**Functional Consequences of Binge-Eating Disorder**
* Social role adjustment problems
* Impaired health-related quality of life and life satisfaction
* Increased medical morbidity and mortality
* Associated with weight gain and development of obesity
* Increased healthcare utilization compared to BMI-matched controls

**Differential Diagnosis of Binge-Eating Disorder vs. Bulimia Nervosa**
* Recurrent binge eating without compensatory behaviors (purging, driven exercise)
* Absence of marked or sustained dietary restriction
* Higher rates of improvement in treatment

**Binge-Eating Disorder vs. Obesity**
* Associated with overweight and obesity but distinct features: higher levels of overvaluation, increased psychiatric comorbidity, effective long-term psychological treatments

**Comorbidities of Binge-Eating Disorder**
* Significant psychiatric comorbidity comparable to bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa
* Most common: bipolar disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders.

#### Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder

**Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (307.59, F50.8)**
- Category for presentations with feeding and eating disorder symptoms causing distress or impairment without meeting full criteria of any specific disorder
- Use "other specified" followed by reason why presentation does not meet criteria for a specific feeding and eating disorder:
  - **Atypical anorexia nervosa**: Significant weight loss, but individual's weight is within or above normal range
  - **Bulimia nervosa (low frequency and/or limited duration)**: All criteria met except binge-eating and compensatory behaviors occur less frequently than weekly and for less than 3 months
  - **Binge-eating disorder (low frequency and/or limited duration)**: All criteria met except binge eating occurs less frequently than weekly and for less than 3 months
  - **Purging disorder**: Recurrent purging behaviors in absence of binge eating
  - **Night eating syndrome**: Recurrent episodes of night eating after sleep or excessive food consumption after evening meal
- Reason for not meeting criteria should be specified if known, otherwise use "unspecified feeding and eating disorder"

**Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder (307.50, F50.9)**
- Category for presentations with feeding and eating disorder symptoms causing distress or impairment without meeting full criteria of any specific disorder
- Use "unspecified" when reason for not meeting criteria is unclear or insufficient information is available.

#### Elimination Disorders
- Involve inappropriate elimination of urine or feces
- Typically first diagnosed in childhood or adolescence
- Group includes:
  - **Enuresis**: Repeated voiding of urine into inappropriate places (nocturnal or diurnal)
  - **Encopresis**: Repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places
- Subtypes for encopresis:
  - Presence or absence of constipation
  - Overflow incontinence
- Minimum age requirements for diagnosis based on developmental, not chronological, age
- Both disorders may be voluntary or involuntary
- Co-occurrence of both disorders can also occur.

#### Enuresis

**Enuresis (Involuntary Urination)**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **307.6 (F98.0)**: A diagnosis code used for enuresis
- **Repeated voiding of urine** into bed or clothes, whether involuntary or intentional
- The behavior is clinically significant as manifested by:
  - Frequency of at least twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months
  - Presence of clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic (occupational), or other important areas of functioning
- Chronological age of at least **5 years** (or equivalent developmental level)
- The behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., diuretic, antipsychotic medication) or another medical condition (e.g., diabetes, spina bifida, seizure disorder)

**Subtypes**:
- **Nocturnal only**: Passage of urine only during nighttime sleep
- **Diurnal only**: Passage of urine during waking hours
- **Nocturnal and diurnal**: A combination of the two subtypes

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Essential feature: Repeated voiding of urine into bed or clothes (Criteria A, B)
  - Most often involuntary, occasionally intentional
  - At least twice a week for 3 consecutive months or clinically significant distress/impairment
- Age: Chronological age of at least **5 years** (or equivalent developmental level) (Criterion C)
- Not attributable to physiological effects or medical conditions (Criterion D)

**Supporting Diagnosis**:
- During nocturnal enuresis, voiding may occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and be recalled in a dream
- In diurnal enuresis, the child defers micturition until incontinence occurs, sometimes due to social anxiety or preoccupation with play activity
  - Most common time for enuresis: Early afternoon on school days
  - May persist despite appropriate treatment of infection

**Prevalence**:
- Prevalence: 5%-10% among **5-year-olds**, 3%-5% among **10-year-olds**, around 1% among individuals **15 years or older**
- Primary vs. Secondary Enuresis:
  - Primary enuresis begins at age **5 years**
  - Most common onset: Ages **5-8 years**, but may occur at any time
  - Spontaneous remission rate: 5%-10% per year
  - Approximately 1% continues into adulthood
  - Diurnal enuresis uncommon after age **9 years**

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**:
- **Predisposing factors**: Delayed or lax toilet training, psychosocial stress
- **Genetic/Physiological**: Delays in development of normal circadian rhythms, abnormalities in central vasopressin receptor sensitivity, reduced functional bladder capacity and hyperreactivity (unstable bladder syndrome)
- Enuresis is a genetically heterogeneous disorder with heritability seen in family, twin, and segregation analyses
  - Risk for childhood nocturnal enuresis: **3.6 times higher** for offspring of enuretic mothers, **10.1 times higher** with paternal urinary incontinence
- Culture-Related: Prevalence rates and developmental trajectories similar across countries; high rates in orphanages/residential institutions
- Gender Differences: Nocturnal enuresis more common in males, diurnal incontinence more common in females
- **Functional Consequences of Enuresis**: Amount of impairment a function of social limitations, effect on self-esteem, degree of ostracism by peers, and caregiver reactions.

###### Diagnosing Enuresis: Considerations for Neurogenic Causes and Comorbidities

**Differential Diagnosis for Enuresis**

**Conditions to Consider:**
- **Neurogenic bladder or another medical condition**:
  * Not made in presence of these conditions causing polyuria or urgency (e.g., untreated diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus)
  * Diagnosis compatible if urinary incontinence was present before development of another medical condition or persists after appropriate treatment

**Medication side effects**:
- Enuresis may occur during antipsychotic medications, diuretics, and other medications inducing incontinence
- Do not make diagnosis in isolation but note as medication side effect
- Diagnosis may be made if urinary incontinence was present prior to treatment with medication

**Comorbidities**:
- **Behavioral symptoms**: Higher prevalence in children with enuresis compared to those without it
- **Developmental delays**: Present in a portion of children with enuresis (speech, language, learning, motor skills)
- **Encopresis**, **sleepwalking**, and **sleep terror disorder** may be present
- **Urinary tract infections** more common in children with enuresis, especially diurnal subtype, than in continent children.

#### Encopresis

**Encopresis Diagnostic Criteria:**
- **Repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places (Criterion A)**
  - Involuntary or intentional
- **At least one such event occurs monthly for at least three months (Criterion B)**
- **Chronological age is at least 4 years (or equivalent developmental level) (Criterion C)**
- **Not attributable to physiological effects of substances or medical conditions except through constipation (Criterion D)**

**Subtypes:**
1. With Constipation and Overflow Incontinence:
   * Characteristically poorly formed feces
   - Leakage is infrequent to continuous, mostly daytime
   - Only part of the feces passed during toileting
   - Resolves after constipation treatment
2. Without Constipation and Overflow Incontinence:
   * Feces of normal form and consistency
   - Soiling may be deliberate or accidental
   - Associated with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, or anal masturba-tion

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Feeling ashamed and wishing to avoid situations causing embarrassment
- Degree of impairment based on effect on self-esteem, social ostracism, and caregiver reaction
- Smearing feces may be deliberate or accidental for hiding incontinence
- Features of oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder when incontinence is deliberate
- Prevalence: approximately 1% of 5-year-olds; more common in males than females

**Development and Course:**
- Not diagnosed until age 4 (or equivalent mental development)
- Predisposing factors include inadequate toilet training and psychosocial stress
- Two types: primary (no established fecal continence) and secondary (after established fecal continence)
- Persists with intermittent exacerbations for years

**Risk and Prognostic Factors:**
- Genetic and physiological factors, such as painful defecation or medication use
- Differential Diagnosis: only appropriate if constipation cannot be explained by other medical conditions.

**Other Specified Elimination Disorder:**
- Used for presentations that cause clinically significant distress or impairment but do not meet criteria for any specific elimination disorder. Code 788.39 (N39.498) for urinary symptoms; 787.60 (R15.9) for fecal symptoms.

#### Unspecified Elimination Disorder

**Unspecified Elimination Disorder**
- Applies to presentations where symptoms of elimination disorder cause clinically significant distress or impairment but do not meet full criteria for any specific diagnosis within the elimination disorders diagnostic class
- Used when:
  - Symptoms characteristic of an elimination disorder are predominant
  - But do not meet criteria for a specific elimination disorder
  - Clinician chooses not to specify reason for lack of criteria
  - Insufficient information is available (e.g., emergency room settings)
- **Coding notes**:
  - Code **788.30 (R32)** for unspecified elimination disorder with urinary symptoms
  - Code **787.60 (R15.9)** for unspecified elimination disorder with fecal symptoms

### Sleep-Wake Disorders

**Sleep-Wake Disorders Classification in DSM-5**

**Background:**
- Intended for general mental health and medical clinicians
- Encompasses 10 disorders: insomnia disorder, hypersomnolence disorder, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, NREM sleep arousal disorders, nightmare disorder, REM sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, substance/medication-induced sleep disorder

**Characteristics:**
- Individuals present with complaints of dissatisfaction regarding sleep quality, timing, and amount
- Resulting daytime distress and impairment are core features for all disorders
- DSM-5 uses a simple approach while reflecting scientific advances since DSM-IV
- "Lumping" or "splitting" approaches used depending on available validators

**Importance:**
- Sleep disorders often accompany depression, anxiety, and cognitive changes
- Persistent sleep disturbances are risk factors for mental illnesses and substance use disorders
- Coexisting medical and neurological conditions are common
- Sleep disorders can indicate underlying medical conditions like breathing-related disorders, heart/lung diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, musculoskeletal system issues, REM sleep behavior disorder (an early indicator of neurogenetic disorders)
- Differential Diagnosis requires a multidimensional approach

**Classification:**
- Lumping approach in some cases like insomnia disorder
- Splitting approach in others, such as narcolepsy
- Useful for clinical assessment and treatment planning
- Superior performance characteristics compared to DSM-IV in terms of interrater reliability, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and face validity

**DSM-5 Classification vs. ICSD-2:**
- DSM-5 simplifies sleep-wake disorders classification like DSM-IV but reflects scientific advances since its publication
- ICSD-2 elaborated numerous diagnostic subtypes and was prepared for use by specialists

**Text Accompaniment:**
- Provides linkages to corresponding non-psychiatric listings from the ICD, such as neurology codes.

#### Insomnia Disorder

**Insomnia Disorder (ICD-9: 780.52; ICD-10: G47.00)**

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- Predominant complaint of dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality
- One or more symptoms: difficulty initiating, maintaining, or early morning awakening
- Clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, educational, academic, behavioral, or other areas of functioning
- Sleep disturbance occurs at least 3 nights per week for 3 months
- Not better explained by another sleep disorder or physiological effects of substances
- Coexisting mental disorders and medical conditions do not adequately explain the complaint

**Specifiers:**
- Episodic: Symptoms last less than 3 months
- Persistent: Symptoms present for more than 3 months
- Recurrent: Two or more episodes within a year

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Difficulty initiating sleep (sleep onset insomnia) or maintaining sleep (sleep maintenance insomnia)
- Early morning awakening with inability to return to sleep
- Nonrestorative sleep: poor quality sleep that does not leave the individual rested upon awakening
- Fatigue, daytime sleepiness, cognitive impairments, mood disturbances, preoccupation with sleep, and excessive efforts to sleep

**Associated Features:**
- Physiological and cognitive arousal factors interfering with sleep
- Maladaptive sleep habits (excessive time in bed, erratic schedule, napping) and cognitions (fear of sleeplessness, apprehensions about daytime impairments, clock monitoring)
- Daytime complaints: fatigue, decreased energy, mood disturbances
- Neurocognitive impairments inconsistently present but may include higher complexity tasks or frequent changes in performance strategy.

###### Insomnia Disorder: Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Long-Term Consequences

**Prevalence**
- About one-third of adults report insomnia symptoms (10%-15% experience daytime impairments)
- 6%-10% have symptoms meeting criteria for insomnia disorder
- Most prevalent sleep disorder
- Approximately 10%-20% complain in primary care settings
- More prevalent among females than males (gender ratio: 1.44:1)
- Often comorbid with another condition or mental disorder (40%-50%)

**Onset and Course**
- Can occur at any point in life, most commonly young adulthood, menopause for women
- Situational, persistent, or recurrent
- Insidious onset without identifiable precipitating factor possible
- Chronicity rates: 45% to 75% for follow-ups of 1-7 years
- Night-to-night variability in sleep patterns
- Characteristics change with age (initiating sleep more common in young adults, maintaining sleep older adults)

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**
- Precipitating events: major life events or chronic daily stress
- Poor sleep habits, irregular scheduling, fear of not sleeping perpetuate problem
- Temperamental: anxiety or worry-prone personality, cognitive styles, increased arousal predisposition, repressed emotions
- Environmental factors: noise, light, uncomfortable temperature, high altitude
- Genetic and physiological: female gender, aging
- Course modifiers: poor sleep hygiene practices (e.g., excessive caffeine use), irregular schedules

**Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues**
- More prevalent complaint among females than males
- Better preservation of sleep continuity and slow wave sleep in older females compared to older males

**Diagnostic Markers**
- Polysomnography: impairments of sleep continuity (increased latency, decreased sleep efficiency), increased stage 1 sleep, decreased deep sleep
- Objective sleep laboratory measures show less daytime sleepiness than individual subjective complaints
- Increased physiological and cognitive arousal plays a significant role in insomnia disorder

**Functional Consequences of Insomnia Disorder**
- Interpersonal, social, occupational problems
- Decreased attention and concentration, increased irritability, poor concentration
- Long-term consequences: increased risks for major depressive disorder, hypertension, myocardial infarction; reduced quality of life, increased economic burden.

###### Insomnia Diagnosis & Comorbidity: Types and Relationships

**Normal Sleep Variations vs Clinical Insomnia**
- **Normal sleep duration**: varies considerably across individuals
- **Short sleepers**: lack difficulty falling or staying asleep, absence of daytime symptoms
- **Short sleepers vs insomnia disorder**: short sleepers may desire longer sleep, creating an insomnia-like pattern
- **Clinical insomnia**: must be distinguished from normal age-related changes and sleep deprivation

**Situational/Acute Insomnia**
- Condition lasting a few days to weeks
- Associated with life events or changes in sleep schedules
- Can produce significant distress, interfere with functioning
- When symptoms are frequent enough: other specified insomnia disorder or unspecified insomnia disorder

**Delayed Sleep Phase and Shift Work Types of Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorder**
- **Delayed sleep phase**: report sleep onset insomnia only when trying to sleep at socially normal times
- No difficulty falling or staying asleep with delayed bed/rising times
- **Shift work type**: distinguished from insomnia disorder by history of recent shift work

**Restless Legs Syndrome**
- Can produce difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep
- Urge to move legs and unpleasant leg sensations differentiate it from insomnia disorder

**Breathing-Related Sleep Disorders**
- Most have history of snoring, breathing pauses, excessive daytime sleepiness
- 50% of those with sleep apnea may report insomnia symptoms, more common in females and older adults
- **Narcolepsy**: characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hallucinations
- Parasomnias: unusual behavior during sleep leading to intermittent awakenings and difficulty resuming sleep

**Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder, Insomnia Type**
- Substance use can worsen insomnia and potentially progress to substance use disorder
- Distinguished from insomnia disorder by etiologically related substance

**Comorbidity of Insomnia**
- Common comorbidity with medical conditions (diabetes, heart disease)
- Risk relationship bidirectional: insomnia increases risk and vice versa
- Comorbid mental disorders: bipolar, depressive, anxiety disorders

**International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2)**
- Recognizes distinct insomnia phenotypes: psychophysiological insomnia, idiopathic insomnia, sleep-state misperception, inadequate sleep hygiene
- Limited evidence to support these distinct phenotypes.

#### Hypersomnolence Disorder

**Hypersomnolence Disorder Criteria (ICD-10-CM)**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **Self-reported excessive sleepiness (hypersomnolence)**: Despite a main sleep period of at least 7 hours, with one or more of the following symptoms:
  - Recurrent periods of sleep or lapses into sleep within the same day
  - A prolonged main sleep episode of more than 9 hours per day that is nonrestorative
  - Difficulty being fully awake after abrupt awakening
- **The hypersomnolence**: Occurs at least three times per week, for at least 3 months
- **The hypersomnolence**: Accompanied by significant distress or impairment in cognitive, social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
- **The hypersomnolence**: Not better explained by and does not occur exclusively during the course of another sleep disorder (e.g., narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorder, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, parasomnia)
- **The hypersomnolence**: Not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., drug of abuse, medication)
- **Coexisting mental and medical disorders**: Do not adequately explain the predominant complaint of excessive sleepiness

**Coding Note**:
- The code `780.54 (G47.1 0)` applies to all three specifiers.
- Code also the relevant associated mental disorder, medical condition, or other sleep disorder immediately after the code for hypersomnolence disorder to indicate the association.

**Specify**:
- **Acute**, **Subacute**, or **Persistent** duration of the excessive sleepiness
- **Current severity** based on degree of difficulty maintaining daytime alertness

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Hypersomnolence: Excessive quantity of sleep, deteriorated quality of wakefulness, and sleep inertia
  - Individuals fall asleep quickly with a good sleep efficiency (>90%)
  - Difficulty waking up in the morning, sometimes appearing confused or combative
  - Sleep inertia: A period of impaired performance and reduced vigilance following awakening
- Nonrestorative sleep, automatic behavior, difficulties awakening, and sleep inertia can also be seen in other conditions (e.g., narcolepsy)
- Approximately 80% of individuals with hypersomnolence report nonrestorative sleep, and up to 50% have sleep inertia
- Short naps (less than 30 minutes) are often unrefreshing
- Hypersomnolence may be more severe and can manifest even in high-attention situations
- Some individuals with hypersomnolence have a family history of excessive sleepiness and autonomic nervous system dysfunction

###### Hypersomnolence Disorder: Causes, Symptoms, and Impact on Daily Life

**Prevalence**
- Approximately 5%-10% of individuals consulting at sleep disorders clinics with complaints of daytime sleepiness are diagnosed with hypersomnolence disorder
- Estimated that about 1% of European and US general population experiences sleep inertia episodes
- Hypersomnolence occurs equally in males and females

**Development and Course**
- Persistent course with progressive evolution in severity of symptoms
- Sleep episodes can last up to 20 hours, average nighttime sleep duration is around 9-10 hours
- Individuals are able to reduce sleep time during working days, but increase it on weekends/holidays by up to 3 hours
- Awakenings difficult and accompanied by sleep inertia episodes in nearly 40% of cases
- Manifests fully in late adolescence or early adulthood (mean age at onset: 17-25 years)
- Individuals diagnosed, on average, 10-15 years after first symptoms appear
- Rare pediatric cases with gradual onset between ages 15 and 25
- Course persistent and stable unless treatment is initiated
- Sleep disorders (e.g., breathing-related sleep disorders) may worsen symptoms

**Environmental Factors**
- Temporary increase from psychological stress or alcohol use, but not precipitating factors
- Viral infections reported to precede/accompanied hypersomnolence in 10% of cases (e.g., HIV pneumonia, infectious mononucleosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome)
- Hypersomnolence can appear within 6-18 months following head trauma

**Genetic and Physiological Factors**
- Familial with autosomal dominant mode of inheritance

**Diagnostic Markers**
- Nocturnal polysomnography: normal to prolonged sleep duration, short sleep latency, increased sleep continuity, normal REM sleep distribution
- Sleep efficiency >90%
- Increased amounts of slow-wave sleep
- Mean sleep latency <10 minutes (<8 minutes in many cases)
- Sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) present but less than 2 times in 4-5 nap opportunities

**Functional Consequences**
- Reduced alertness, efficiency, concentration, and memory during daytime activities
- Significant distress and dysfunction in work and social relationships
- Difficulty meeting morning obligations (e.g., arriving at work on time)
- Unintentional daytime sleep episodes can be embarrassing or dangerous

###### "Differentiating Hypersomnolence Disorder from Other Sleep-Related Conditions"

**Hypersomnolence Disorder Differential Diagnosis:**
- **Normative Variation in Sleep**: Normal sleep duration varies greatly in population
- *Long Sleepers*: No excessive sleepiness, sleep inertia, or automatic behavior with required amount of nocturnal sleep
- Sleep reported as refreshing
- If social/occupational demands lead to shorter nocturnal sleep, daytime symptoms may appear
- **Inadequate Nocturnal Sleep** vs Hypersomnolence:
  + Inadequate nocturnal sleep can produce similar daytime sleepiness symptoms as hypersomnolence
  + Average sleep duration <7 hours suggests inadequate nocturnal sleep, >9-10 hours suggests hypersomnolence
  - Individuals with insufficient nocturnal sleep typically catch up on longer sleep durations when free from demands
  + Unlike hypersomnolence, inadequate nocturnal sleep unlikely to persist unabated for decades
- **Diagnostic Trial**: Sleep extension for 10-14 days can clarify diagnosis
- **Poor Sleep Quality and Fatigue**: Distinguish from excessive sleepiness related to insufficient sleep quantity or quality and fatigue
  + Excessive sleepiness and fatigue difficult to differentiate, may overlap considerably
- **Breathing-Related Sleep Disorders**: Individuals with hypersomnolence and breathing disorders have similar excessive sleepiness patterns
  + History of snoring, pauses in breathing during sleep, brain injury, cardiovascular disease, obesity, oropharyngeal anatomical abnormalities, hypertension, heart failure suggest breathing-related sleep disorder
  + Polysomnographic studies can confirm presence of apneic events and absence in hypersomnolence
- **Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders**: Characterized by daytime sleepiness, history of abnormal sleep-wake schedule with shifted or irregular hours
- **Parasomnias**: Rarely produce prolonged undisturbed nocturnal sleep or daytime sleepiness characteristic of hypersomnolence disorder
  + Distinguish from mental disorders associated with hypersomnolence: depressive disorders, bipolar disorders (during a depressive episode), major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern, substance-related disorders related to self-medication with stimulants, neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy
- **Comorbidity**: Hypersomnolence can be associated with depressive disorders, bipolar disorders (during a depressive episode), major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern, substance-related disorders related to self-medication with stimulants. Individuals with hypersomnolence disorder are at risk for these conditions.
- **Relationships and Classification**: Hypersomnolence disorder classified as "hypersomnias of central origin" in International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2).

#### Narcolepsy

**Narcolepsy Diagnosis Criteria (ICD-9-CM Code 347.00-347.10)**

**Diagnostic Criteria for Narcolepsy:**
- Recurrent periods of an irrepressible need to sleep, lapsing into sleep, or napping occurring within the same day at least three times per week over the past 3 months (Criterion A)
- Presence of one or more of the following:
  - Episodes of cataplexy:
    * Sudden bilateral loss of muscle tone with maintained consciousness precipitated by laughter or joking (Cataplexy subtype)
      - In individuals with long-standing disease
      - In children or within 6 months of onset: spontaneous grimaces, jaw-opening episodes, tongue thrusting, or global hypotonia without emotional triggers
    * Hypocretin deficiency as measured using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 immunoreactivity values (less than one-third of healthy subjects' levels or less than 110 pg/mL), not observed in context of acute brain injury, inflammation, or infection (Criterion B1)
    * Nocturnal sleep polysomnography showing rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency less than 15 minutes or multiple sleep latency test showing a mean sleep latency less than 8 minutes and two or more sleep-onset REM periods (Criterion B2)

**Subtypes:**
- Narcolepsy without cataplexy but with hypocretin deficiency: low CSF levels of hypocretin-1 and positive polysomnography/multiple sleep latency test, no cataplexy present (347.00)
- Narcolepsy with cataplexy but without hypocretin deficiency: rare subtype, normal CSF hypocretin-1 levels, Criterion 8 requirements of cataplexy and positive polysomnography/multiple sleep latency test met (347.01)
- Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narcolepsy: late-onset (age 30-40 years), low or intermediate CSF hypocretin-1 levels, deafness, cerebellar ataxia, eventualement dementia, caused by exon 21 DNA methyltransferase-1 mutations (347.00)
- Autosomal dominant narcolepsy, obesity, and type 2 diabetes: rare cases with normal CSF hypocretin-1 levels but associated with a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein gene mutation (347.00)
- Narcolepsy secondary to another medical condition: develops secondary to infectious, traumatic, or tumoral destruction of hypocretin neurons, HLA DQB1*06:02 may be positive in some cases (347.10).

**Coding Note:**
- Code the underlying medical condition first and specify current severity for ICD-9-CM code 347.10 only: Mild, Moderate, or Severe.

**Additional Considerations:**
- Unclear "cataplexy-like" symptoms may be reported without emotional triggers in some cases of narcolepsy without cataplexy but with hypocretin deficiency (repeating the test is advised before establishing subtype diagnosis)
- In narcolepsy with cataplexy but without hypocretin deficiency, HLA DQB1*06:02 may be negative and seizures, falls of other origin, or conversion disorder should be excluded.
- In secondary narcolepsy caused by infectious, traumatic, or tumoral destruction of hypocretin neurons, HLA DQB1*06:02 may be positive and result from the insult triggering the autoimmune process. Other cases may have destruction of hypocretin neurons secondary to trauma or hypothalamic surgery.
- Head trauma or infections of the central nervous system can produce transitory decreases in CSF hypocretin-1 levels without hypocretin cell loss, complicating diagnosis.

###### Diagnostic Criteria for Narcolepsy with Cataplexy

**Criteria for Diagnosis of Narcolepsy with Cataplexy:**

**Criterion A (Recurrent Daytime Naps or Sleep Lapses):**
- Recurring daytime naps or sleep lapses
- Minimum of three times a week for at least 3 months

**Criterion B1 (Cataplexy Triggered by Emotions):**
- Cataplexy is triggered by emotions, typically laughing and joking
- Occurs a few times per month when untreated or in the past
- Should not be confused with physiological weakness or stress-induced tremors

**Criterion B2 (Alternative Presentations of Cataplexy):**
- Atypical cataplexy may affect primarily face, causing grimaces or jaw opening
- Low-grade continuous hypotonia yielding wobbling walk
- Criterion Bl(b) can be met in children or within 6 months of rapid onset

**Hypocretin Deficiency:**
- Nearly always results from loss of hypothalamic hypocretin-producing cells
- Hypocretin deficiency: less than one-third of control values, or 110 pg/mL
- Caused by an autoimmune process and almost all affected individuals carry HLA-DQB1*06:02

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- Gold standard: CSF hypocretin-1 measurement
- Polysomnographic sleep study followed by Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT)
- Must be performed after stopping psychotropic medications and adequate sleep time documentation.

###### Narcolepsy: Diagnosis, Characteristics, and Functional Consequences

**Associated Features of Narcolepsy-Cataplexy**

**Severe Sleepiness**:
- Automatic behaviors may occur without memory or consciousness
- Vivid hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations before/after sleep (distinct from less vivid dreamlike mentation)
- Nightmares and vivid dreaming common
- REM sleep behavior disorder
- Sleep paralysis upon falling asleep or awakening, leaving individuals awake but unable to move or speak

**Nocturnal Disruptions**:
- Nocturnal eating and obesity
- Frequent long/short awakenings, which can be disabling
- Individuals may appear sleepy or fall asleep during clinical assessment

**Cataplexy**:
- Sudden loss of muscle tone, leaving individuals slumped in a chair with slurred speech and drooping eyelids
- Reflexes abolished when clinician checks during cataplexy attack (distinguishes from conversion disorder)

**Prevalence and Development**:
- Affects 0.02%-0.04% of the general population
- Onset typically in children/adolescents/young adults, rarely in older adults
- Abrupt or progressive onset, with symptoms progressing to inability to stay awake during the day and maintain good sleep at night

**Risk Factors**:
- Genetic factors: 10-40-fold increased risk in first-degree relatives
- Environmental triggers: group A streptococcal throat infection, influenza (especially H1N1), head trauma, abrupt changes in sleep patterns

**Diagnostic Tests**:
- Functional imaging suggests impaired hypothalamic responses to humor stimuli
- Polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) confirm diagnosis
  - Sleep-onset REM period within 15 minutes highly specific, moderately sensitive
  - Averaged sleep latency of less than 8 minutes on MSLT in most individuals with narcolepsy versus 2%-4% of controls or individuals with other sleep disorders

###### Narcolepsy Diagnosis: Differentiating Factors and Misdiagnoses

**Differential Diagnosis: Hypersomnia vs. Narcolepsy**

**Similarities**:
- Degree of daytime sleepiness
- Age at onset
- Stable course over time

**Distinctive Features**:

**Hypersomnia**:
- Longer and less disrupted nocturnal sleep
- Greater difficulty awakening
- Persistent daytime sleepiness (vs. more discrete "sleep attacks" in narcolepsy)
- Longer and less refreshing daytime sleep episodes
- Little or no dreaming during daytime naps

**Narcolepsy**:
- Cataplexy: sudden, rapid loss of muscle tone often triggered by strong emotions (e.g., laughter, surprise)
- Recurrent intrusions of elements of REM sleep into the transition between sleep and wakefulness (e.g., sleep-related hallucinations, sleep paralysis)
- Shorter sleep latencies during MSLT
- Presence of multiple sleep-onset REM periods in MSLT

**Other Conditions to Consider**:

**Sleep Deprivation/Insufficient Nocturnal Sleep**:
- Difficulties falling asleep at night (adolescents)
- Positive MSLT result if conducted while sleep deprived or with phase-delayed sleep

**Sleep Apnea Syndromes**:
- Common in obese individuals
- Cataplexy may be overlooked or absent, assuming obstructive sleep apnea unresponsive to usual therapies

**Major Depressive Disorder**:
- Narcolepsy or hypersomnia may be associated/confused with depression
- Cataplexy is not present in depression
- Normal MSLT results, dissociation between subjective and objective sleepiness

**Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)**:
- Atypical features such as long-lasting cataplexy or unusual triggers may be present
- Individuals report sleeping and dreaming but MSLT does not show characteristic sleep-onset REM period
- Full-blown, long-lasting pseudocataplexy during consultation allows examining physician to verify reflexes that remain intact

**Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder or Other Behavioral Problems**:
- Sleepiness can cause behavioral problems (e.g., aggressiveness, inattention) leading to misdiagnosis

**Seizures**:
- Cataplexy can be misdiagnosed as seizures
- Seizures are more likely to occur when individuals are not expecting them and may cause injury during falls
- Isolated atonia without other seizure signs rare in absence of other seizures, and have distinct electroencephalogram signatures

**Chorea/Movement Disorders**:
- Cataplexy can be misdiagnosed as chorea or pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (especially with strep throat and high antibody levels)
- Overlapping movement disorder may occur close to cataplexy onset

**Schizophrenia**:
- In presence of vivid hypnagogic hallucinations, individuals may believe they are real, suggesting schizophrenia
- With stimulant treatment, persecutory delusions may develop if cataplexy is present
- If cataplexy is present, clinician should assume it is secondary to narcolepsy before considering co-occurring diagnosis of schizophrenia.

**Comorbidities**:
- Narcolepsy can co-occur with bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders; rare cases with schizophrenia
- Associated with increased body mass index/obesity, especially when untreated
- Comorbid sleep apnea should be considered if there is a sudden aggravation of preexisting narcolepsy.

#### Breathing- Related Sleep Disorders

##### Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea

**Criteria**:
- **Polysomnography findings**:
  - At least 5 obstructive apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep with:
    - Nocturnal breathing disturbances (e.g., snoring, snorting/gasping, pauses)
    - Daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep
  - 15+ obstructive apneas and/or hypopneas per hour of sleep
- **Specify severity**: Mild (<15), Moderate (15-30), Severe (>30) based on Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI)
  - AHI measures number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep using polysomnography or other monitoring
  - Also consider nocturnal desaturation, sleep fragmentation, and symptoms/daytime impairment

**Features**:
- Most common breathing-related sleep disorder
- Characterized by repeated upper airway obstruction during sleep (apneas, hypopneas)
- Apnea: total absence of airflow
- Hypopnea: reduction in airflow
  - Minimum duration: 10 seconds in adults, 2 missed breaths in children
  - Typically associated with oxygen desaturation (>3%) and/or electroencephalographic arousal
- Symptoms: snoring, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, unrefreshing sleep
  - Diagnosed by polysomnography and symptoms (nocturnal or daytime)

**Associated Features**:
- Nocturia, heartburn, morning headaches, dry mouth, erectile dysfunction, reduced libido
- Difficulty breathing while lying supine or sleeping
- Increased risk of hypertension (>60%) in individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea

###### Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea: Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Impact

**Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea**

**Prevalence:**
- Affects at least 1%-2% of children, 2%-15% of middle-age adults, and over 20% of older individuals
- Prevalence may be high in elderly populations due to obesity rates
- Higher prevalence among males, older adults, certain racial/ethnic groups
- Male-to-female ratio: 2:1 to 4:1 (adults), no gender difference in children

**Development and Course:**
- Age distribution follows J-shaped distribution with peak in children ages 3-8 due to tonsillar tissue
- Prevalence decreases with growth, then increases with obesity and menopause in females
- Insidious onset, gradual progression, and persistent course
- Symptoms may lead to evaluation, weight gain can precipitate increase
- Average apnea hypopnea index (AHI) increase: 2 additional apneas/hypopneas per hour over 4-5 years

**Children:**
- Diagnosis more difficult due to subtle symptoms and reduced sensitivity of self-reported symptoms
- More noticeable nighttime symptoms, such as observed apnea or labored breathing in young children
- Older children: excessive daytime sleepiness, behavioral problems, learning difficulties, failure to thrive

**Risk Factors:**
- Genetic (strong basis, family aggregation) and physiological (obesity, gender)
- Other risks: maxillary-mandibular retrognathia or micrognathia, positive family history, genetic syndromes, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, menopause in females, endocrine disorders, certain medications

**Diagnostic Markers:**
- Polysomnography: confirms diagnosis, quantifies respiratory disturbances and oxygen saturation changes
- Low AHI thresholds for children (2 or less) compared to adults due to different breathing patterns
- Arterial blood gas measurements may reveal waking hypoxemia or hypercapnia
- Imaging: narrowing of upper airway, cardiac testing shows impaired ventricular function, elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit values in severe cases

**Functional Consequences:**
- Increased risk for occupational accidents and motor vehicle crashes
- Reduced health-related quality of life, especially in physical and vitality subscales.

###### Differential Diagnosis of Sleep Disorders: OSA, Narcolepsy, Panic Attacks, ADHD, Substance-Induced Insomnia/Hypersomnia, and Comorbidities.

**Differential Diagnosis of Sleep Disorders**

**Primary Snoring vs. Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea (OSAH)**:
- Individuals with OSAH must be differentiated from those with **primary snoring** (asymptomatic individuals who snore without abnormalities on polysomnography)
- Presence of nocturnal gasping and choking suggests the diagnosis of OSAH, but requires polysomnography

**Definitive Differential Diagnosis**:
- Requires polysomnographic studies to distinguish between **hypersomnia**, **central sleep apnea**, **sleep-related hypoventilation**, and **OSAH**
- OSAH must be differentiated from other causes of sleepiness, such as **narcolepsy**, **hypersomnia**, and **circadian rhythm sleep disorders**

**Differentiating from Other Sleep Disorders**:
- OSAH can be differentiated from **narcolepsy** by the absence of cataplexy, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis, and the presence of loud snoring, gasping during sleep, or observed apneas
- Daytime sleep episodes in narcolepsy are shorter, more refreshing, and more often associated with dreaming
- OSAH shows characteristic apneas and hypopneas and oxygen desaturation on nocturnal polysomnography
- Narcolepsy may also be associated with obesity, and some individuals have concurrent OSAH and narcolepsy

**Insomnia Disorder**:
- Can be differentiated from OSAH by the absence of snoring and lack of history/symptoms characteristic of OSAH
- However, insomnia and OSAH may coexist, requiring concurrent treatment to improve sleep

**Panic Attacks vs. OSAH**:
- Nocturnal panic attacks may include symptoms of gasping or choking during sleep, difficult to distinguish clinically from OSAH
- Lower frequency of episodes, intense autonomic arousal, and lack of excessive sleepiness differentiate nocturnal panic attacks from OSAH
- Polysomnography in individuals with nocturnal panic attacks does not reveal the typical pattern of apneas/hypopneas and oxygen desaturation characteristic of OSAH

**Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**:
- ADHD symptoms may be similar to those of childhood obstructive sleep apnea, but presence of other symptoms/signs of OSAH suggests the diagnosis
- Obstructive sleep apnea and ADHD may commonly co-occur, with risk factors like enlarged tonsils, obesity, or family history of sleep apnea

**Substance-Induced Insomnia or Hypersomnia**:
- Substance use/withdrawal can produce insomnia or hypersomnia; a careful history usually suffices to identify the relevant substance/medication
- In some cases, substance use may exacerbate OSAH; an individual with OSAH symptoms should receive that diagnosis, even in the presence of concurrent substance use

**Comorbidities**:
- **Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (OSAH)** is associated with increased risk of **systemic hypertension**, **coronary artery disease**, **heart failure**, **stroke**, and **mortality**
- Associated conditions, such as cerebrovascular disease or Parkinson's disease, may increase the frequency of OSAH
- As many as 1/3 of individuals with OSAH report symptoms of depression, with a correlation between severity of OSAH and depression

##### Central Sleep Apnea

**Central Sleep Apnea Disorders**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- Evidence by polysomnography of five or more central apneas per hour of sleep
- The disorder is not better explained by another current sleep disorder

**Subtypes**:
1. **Idiopathic Central Sleep Apnea (G47.31)**: Characterized by repeated episodes of apneas and hypopneas during sleep caused by variability in respiratory effort without evidence of airway obstruction
2. **Cheyne-Stokes Breathing (R06.3)**: A pattern of periodic crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume resulting in central apneas and hypopneas at a frequency of at least five events per hour, accompanied by frequent arousals
3. **Central Sleep Apnea Comorbid with Opioid Use (G47.37)**: Attributed to the effects of opioids on respiratory rhythm generators in the medulla and differential effects on hypoxic versus hypercapnic respiratory drive

**Coding Note for Cheyne-Stokes Breathing Subtype**:
- When an opioid use disorder is present, first code the opioid use disorder (305.50 or 304.00) and then code 780.57 for central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use
- When an opioid use disorder is not present, only code 780.57 for central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use

**Severity of Central Sleep Apnea**:
- Graded based on frequency of breathing disturbances and associated oxygen desaturation and sleep fragmentation
- Subtypes: Idiopathic central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes breathing are characterized by high loop gain, leading to periodic variations in ventilation and PaC02 levels

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Central sleep apnea disorders are characterized by repeated episodes of apneas and hypopneas during sleep caused by variability in respiratory effort
- These are disorders of ventilatory control with periodic or intermittent respiratory events
- Idiopathic central sleep apnea is characterized by sleepiness, insomnia, and awakenings due to dyspnea, with five or more central apneas per hour of sleep
- Cheyne-Stokes breathing is characterized by a pattern of periodic crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume resulting in central apneas and hypopneas at a frequency of at least five events per hour, accompanied by frequent arousals

**Supporting Diagnosis**:
- Individuals with central sleep apnea hypopneas may manifest symptoms such as sleepiness or insomnia
- Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea can coexist with Cheyne-Stokes breathing, resulting in snoring and abruptly terminating apneas during sleep
- Prevalence: Idiopathic central sleep apnea is rare, while the prevalence of Cheyne-Stokes breathing is high (20% or higher) in individuals with ejection fractions less than 45%

**Prevalence and Course**:
- Central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use occurs in approximately 30% of individuals taking chronic opiates for nonmalignant pain
- Risk factors: Genetic, physiological (e.g., heart failure, stroke), age, gender

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Distinguished from other breathing-related sleep disorders and medical/mental conditions based on polysomnography findings

##### Sleep-Related Hypoventilation

**Sleep-Related Hypoventilation: Diagnostic Criteria**

**Diagnostic Criteria for Sleep-Related Hypoventilation:**
* Polysomnography reveals episodes of decreased respiration and elevated C02 levels during sleep.
* Persistent low levels of hemoglobin oxygen saturation unassociated with apneic/hypopneic events may indicate hypoventilation.
* Disturbance not better explained by another current sleep disorder.

**Subtypes:**
1. Idiopathic Hypoventilation (327.24, G47.34): Not attributable to any readily identified condition.
2. Congenital Central Alveolar Hypoventilation (327.25, G47.35): Rare congenital disorder characterized by shallow breathing or cyanosis and apnea during sleep in the perinatal period.
3. Comorbid Sleep-Related Hypoventilation (327.26, G47.36): Occurs due to medical conditions like pulmonary disorders or neuromuscular/chest wall disorders, medications, obesity, or substance use disorder.

**Grading Severity:**
* Based on degree of hypoxemia and hypercarbia during sleep and evidence of end-organ impairment (e.g., right heart failure).
* Blood gas abnormalities during wakefulness indicate greater severity.

**Associated Features:**
* Excessive daytime sleepiness, frequent arousals and awakenings, morning headaches, insomnia complaints.
* Episodes of orthopnea due to diaphragm weakness.
* Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea or central sleep apnea may coexist.
* Consequences: pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale (right heart failure), polycythemia, neurocognitive dysfunction.
* Frequent arousals or bradytachycardia during episodes of hypoventilation.
* Individuals may complain of excessive sleepiness and insomnia or present with findings of neurocognitive dysfunction or depression.
* Features of the medical condition causing sleep-related hypoventilation can also be present.

###### Sleep-Related Hypoventilation: Prevalence, Diagnosis, and Complications

**Prevalence**
- Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation in adults is very uncommon
- Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation: unknown prevalence; rare disorder
- Comorbid sleep-related hypoventilation more common, reflects severity of underlying condition

**Development and Course**
- Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation is a slowly progressive respiratory impairment
- Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation manifests at birth or during infancy/childhood due to variable penetrance of PHOX2B mutation
- Children with congenital central alveolar hypoventilation may have associated disorders (e.g., autoimmune, Hirschsprung's disease)

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**
- Environmental: reduced ventilatory drive due to central nervous system depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opiates, alcohol)
- Genetic and physiological: underlying neurological deficits in ventilation control centers
- Comorbid conditions: pulmonary disorders, neuromuscular/chest wall disorders, hypothyroidism, medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, opiates)
- Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the PHOX2B gene

**Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues**
- Sleep-related hypoventilation diagnosis reflects gender distributions of underlying conditions (e.g., COPD, neuromuscular disorders)

**Diagnostic Markers**
- Gold standard: arterial blood gas measurements showing sleep-related hypoxemia and hypercapnia
- Prolonged decreases in oxygen saturation during sleep (less than 90% for more than 5 minutes with a nadir of at least 85%, or oxygen saturation less than 90% for at least 30% of sleep time)

**Consequences of Sleep-Related Hypoventilation**
- Chronic exposure to hypercapnia and hypoxemia causes vasoconstriction, pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, cognitive dysfunction, polycythemia, cardiac arrhythmias, and progressive respiratory failure

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Distinguish from other medical conditions affecting ventilation (e.g., lung disease), other breathing-related sleep disorders (obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, central sleep apnea) based on clinical features and polysomnography findings
- Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation: exclusion of lung diseases, skeletal malformations, neuromuscular disorders, medical/neurological conditions or medications affecting ventilation

**Comorbidity**
- Sleep-related hypoventilation often occurs with pulmonary disorders (e.g., interstitial lung disease, COPD), neuromuscular/chest wall disorders, and medication use (e.g., benzodiazepines, opiates)
- Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation may occur in association with autonomic dysfunction and Hirschsprung's disease

**Classification**
- International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2): sleep-related hypoventilation/hypoxemic syndromes
- DSM-5: distinct sleep-related pathogenetic processes leading to hypoventilation

##### Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders

**Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders: Delayed Sleep Phase Type**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- Persistent or recurrent pattern of sleep disruption due to an alteration of the circadian system or misalignment between endogenous rhythm and sleep schedule
- Causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational functioning

**Features of Delayed Sleep Phase Type**:
- Delayed sleep onset and awakening times
- Inability to fall asleep and awaken at desired/acceptable earlier time
- Symptoms: insomnia, difficulty waking, excessive early day sleepiness
- Normal sleep quality and duration when allowed to set own schedule

**Associated Features**:
- History of mental disorders or concurrent mental disorder
- Extreme and prolonged difficulty awakening with morning confusion
- Psychophysiological insomnia due to maladaptive behaviors

**Prevalence, Course, and Prognosis**:
- Prevalence: approximately 0.17% in general population, greater than 7% in adolescents
- Familial history present in individuals with delayed sleep phase type
- Persistent course lasting longer than 3 months with intermittent exacerbations
- Symptoms begin typically in adolescence and early adulthood, may decrease with age
- Exacerbation triggered by changes in work or school schedule

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Normal sleep patterns without personal distress
- Other circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (e.g., non-24-hour sleep-wake type)
- Sleep disturbances and other medical, neurological, mental disorders causing excessive sleepiness

**Comorbidities**:
- Strongly associated with depression, personality disorder, somatic symptom disorder/illness anxiety disorder
- Comorbid sleep disorders (e.g., insomnia, restless legs syndrome, sleep apnea) and depressive/bipolar and anxiety disorders can exacerbate symptoms

##### Advanced Sleep Phase Type 

**Advanced Sleep Phase Type Specifiers:**
* Familial history of advanced sleep phase
* Onset of symptoms may occur earlier (childhood, early adulthood)
* Autosomal dominant mode of inheritance
* Prevalence: approximately 1% in middle-age adults, more common in older adults
* Characterized by sleep-wake times several hours earlier than desired or conventional
* Diagnosis based on advanced timing of major sleep period (more than 2 hours), early morning insomnia, and daytime sleepiness
* Individuals exhibit normal sleep quality and duration for age when allowed to set schedule

**Diagnostic Features:**
* "Morning types" with earlier sleep-wake times
* Earlier timing of circadian biomarkers (melatonin, core body temperature rhythms)
* Persistent sleep deprivation from early rise time when keeping conventional schedules
* Use of hypnotics or alcohol for sleep maintenance insomnia, stimulants for daytime sleepiness may lead to substance abuse

**Clinical Expression:**
* Onset is usually in late adulthood but can be earlier in familial form
* Persistent course lasting more than 3 months
* Severity of symptoms depends on work and social schedules
* Variable clinical expression across lifespan depending on obligations
* Remission possible when individuals can alter their schedules to accommodate advanced circadian timing

**Risk Factors:**
* Decreased late afternoon/early evening light exposure, increased risk for advancing circadian rhythms
* Shortened endogenous circadian period in familial form

**Functional Consequences:**
* Excessive sleepiness can negatively impact cognitive performance, social interaction, and safety
* Use of wake-promoting agents or sedatives may increase risk for substance abuse. 

**Differential Diagnosis:**
* Rule out other sleep disorders like insomnia disorder and mental disorders (depression, bipolar) with early morning symptoms
* Consider comorbid medical conditions and mental disorders.

##### Irregular Sleep-Wake Type

**Irregular Sleep-Wake Type:**

**Characteristics:**
- Based on history of insomnia at night and excessive sleepiness during the day
- Lack of discernible sleep-wake circadian rhythm
- No major sleep period, fragmented into multiple periods throughout 24 hours (longest between 2:00 AM and 6:00 AM)
- Often associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, or neurodevelopmental disorders in children

**Associated Features:**
- Insomnia or excessive sleepiness depending on time of day
- Fragmented sleep and wake periods across 24 hours
- History of isolation or reclusion may occur
- Frequent napping throughout the day

**Prevalence:**
- Unknown in general population

**Course:**
- Persistent condition with variable age at onset, more common in older adults

**Risk and Prognostic Factors:**
- Neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease) and neurodevelopmental disorders increase risk
- Decreased exposure to environmental light and structured daytime activity can contribute to weak external entraining stimuli

**Diagnostic Markers:**
- Detailed sleep history
- Sleep diary or actigraphy

**Functional Consequences:**
- Insomnia or excessive sleepiness depending on time of day
- Disruption of caregiver's sleep

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Normative variations in sleep
- Voluntary irregular sleep-wake schedule and poor sleep hygiene
- Comorbidities: medical conditions, mental disorders (including intellectual disability and traumatic brain injury) that result in social isolation or lack of light and structured activities.

##### Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Type

**Diagnostic Features of Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Type**

**Symptoms:**
- History of insomnia or excessive sleepiness
- Alternating periods of sleep disturbance and asymptomatic periods
- Gradual increase in sleep latency leading to sleep-onset insomnia
- Trouble staying awake during the day, leading to excessive daytime sleepiness
- Circadian rhythm not aligned with external 24-hour environment

**Associated Features:**
- Most common among blind or visually impaired individuals
- Decreased light perception and exposure
- Delayed sleep phase history
- Increased sleep duration
- Prevalence: rare in sighted individuals, 50% in blind individuals
- Course: persistent with intermittent remission and exacerbations
- Age at onset variable depending on visual impairment onset
- Irregular sleep schedules and exposure to light or lack of light can worsen symptoms

**Risk Factors:**
- Decreased light perception and exposure in sighted individuals
- Social isolation and behavioral factors
- Developing after changes in sleep habits (e.g., night shift work, job loss)
- Traumatic brain injury

**Diagnostic Markers:**
- History and sleep diary or actigraphy for an extended period
- Sequential measurement of phase markers (e.g., melatonin)

**Functional Consequences:**
- Inability to attend school or maintain a steady job due to unpredictable sleep and wake times
- Increased potential for social isolation

**Differentiation from Other Disorders:**
- Non-24-hour sleep-wake type vs. delayed sleep phase type: presence of a daily delay drift in non-24-hour sleep-wake type, while delayed sleep phase type displays a consistent delay for several days.
- Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders vs. non-24-hour sleep-wake type: presence of other circadian rhythm abnormalities (e.g., irregular sleeping hours) in addition to non-24-hour sleep-wake type.
- Depressive symptoms and depressive disorders may result in similar circadian dysregulation, but non-24-hour sleep-wake type has a more significant impact on social functioning and daytime activity.

**Comorbidities:**
- Blindness
- Depressive and bipolar disorders with social isolation.

##### Shift Work Type

**Shift Work Type Diagnostic Features and Prevalence**

**Diagnosis**: Based on:
- History of working outside normal daytime hours (especially at night) on a regular basis
- Symptoms of excessive sleepiness at work and impaired sleep at home persistently

**Prevailing Symptoms**:
1. Shift work effects usually resolve when returning to daytime routine
2. Individuals traveling across time zones frequently may experience similar symptoms

**Prevalence**:
- Unclear, estimated to affect 5%-10% of night worker population (16%-20% of workforce)
- Prevalence rises with age and middle-age

**Development and Course**:
- Shift work type can appear at any age, more common in older adults
- Disruptive work hours may worsen over time if persist
- Older adults may experience more sleep disruption despite similar phase adjustment as younger adults

**Risk Factors**:
1. **Temperamental**: morning-type disposition, long sleep duration needs, competing demands
2. **Genetic and physiological**: obesity, sleep apnea exacerbating symptoms
3. **Functional consequences**: poor work performance, accidents, mental health issues (e.g., alcohol use disorder), physical health problems (e.g., gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer), bipolar disorder mania episodes
4. **Differential diagnosis**: normative variations vs shift work type symptoms and severity; rule out other sleep disorders like sleep apnea, insomnia, narcolepsy
5. **Comorbidity**: increased risk for alcohol use disorder, substance use disorders, depression
6. **International classification**: Shift Work Type in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2) includes nine circadian rhythm sleep disorders.

#### Parasomnias

**Parasomnias: Sleep Disorders Characterized by Abnormal Events**

**Definition**: Parasomnias are disorders associated with abnormal behavioral, experiential, or physiological events during sleep or transition between sleep stages.

**Common Types of Parasomnias:**
- **Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) Sleep Arousal Disorders**: Occur in association with NREM sleep and represent a mixture of wakefulness and NREM sleep.
- **Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep Behavior Disorder**: Happens during REM sleep, characterized by the loss of the normal inhibition on voluntary muscle activation that occurs in REM sleep. This leads to behavioral components typically associated with wakefulness.

**Key Points:**
- Parasomnias demonstrate that sleep and wakefulness are not mutually exclusive states.
- Sleep is not a global phenomenon, as these disorders show that different brain regions can be activated during various sleep stages.

##### Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorders

**Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorders**

**Criteria for Diagnosis**:
- Repeated episodes of incomplete awakening from sleep during first third of major sleep episode (Criterion A)
- Accompanied by one or more of the following:
  - **Sleepwalking:** Rising from bed during sleep, blank stare, relatively unresponsive, difficulty waking (A1)
    - May include complex behaviors (sitting up, leaving bed, using objects)
    - Can result in injuries due to lack of pain perception
    - Subtypes: With sleep-related eating or sexual behavior (F51.3)
  - **Sleep Terrors:** Sudden arousals with panic and intense fear, autonomic signs (A2)
    - Occur during first third of major sleep episode
    - Lasting minutes to hours
    - Difficult to awaken or comfort during episode
    - Amnesia for episode on waking (F51.4)

**Other Features**:
- No dream imagery recalled
- Amnesia for episodes is present
- Clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning
- Not attributable to substance effects
- Coexisting disorders do not explain the arousal events

**Coding and Diagnostic Features**:
- For ICD-9-CM: code 307.46 for all subtypes
- For ICD-10-CM: code based on subtype (F51.3 or F51.4)

###### "Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Functional Consequences of Sleepwalking and Sleep Terrors"

**Prevalence of NREM Sleep Arousal Disorders**
- Common in general population: 10% to 30% children have slept walked at least once, 2%-3% sleepwalk frequently
- Prevalence of sleepwalking disorder: 1%-5%
- Prevalence of sleepwalking episodes in adults: 1.0%-7.0%, with weekly to monthly occurrences in 0.5%-0.7%
- Lifetime prevalence of sleepwalking in adults: 29.2%, past-year prevalence: 3.6%
- Prevalence of sleep terrors: unknown, but approximately 36.9% at 18 months, 19.7% at 30 months, and 2.2% in adults

**Development and Course**
- Most common in childhood, decreases with age
- Onset of sleepwalking in adulthood should prompt search for specific etiologies (obstructive sleep apnea, nocturnal seizures, medication)
- Environmental factors: sedatives, sleep deprivation, sleep schedule disruptions, fatigue, stress
- Genetic and physiological factors: family history, unknown mode of inheritance

**Diagnostic Markers**
- NREM arousal disorders arise from any stage of NREM sleep, most commonly deep NREM (slow-wave) sleep
- Most likely to occur in first third of night, rarely during daytime naps
- Polysomnography: obscured with movement artifact, theta or alpha frequency activity during episode indicates partial arousal
- No specific polysomnographic markers for sleepwalking or terror, but sleep deprivation may increase likelihood of capturing an event

**Functional Consequences of NREM Sleep Arousal Disorders**
- Clinically significant distress or impairment required for diagnosis
- Embarrassment and social isolation are common
- Occasional occurrences in nonclinical populations
- Serious injuries to self or others rare, but can happen (not "sought out")
- NREM sleep arousal disorders may lead to violent or injurious behaviors with forensic implications.

###### Differential Diagnosis: Sleep Arousals and Related Disorders

**Differential Diagnosis of Sleep Disorders:**
- **Nightmare Disorder vs NREM Sleep Arousal Disorders**
  * Individuals with Nightmare Disorder: awaken easily and completely, report vivid story-like dreams, episodes later in the night, occur during REM sleep
  * Individuals with NREM Sleep Arousal Disorders: characterized by fragmentary imagery, difficulty waking up, confusion, amnesia, occur during NREM sleep

**Other Conditions to Consider:**
- **Breathing-related Sleep Disorders:** symptoms include snoring, breathing pauses, daytime sleepiness
- **REM Sleep Behavior Disorder:** episodes of prominent complex movements, personal injury, occurs during REM sleep
- **Parasomnia Overlap Syndrome:** clinical and polysomnographic features of both sleepwalking and REM sleep behavior disorder
- **Sleep-related Seizures:** nocturnal seizures may mimic NREM sleep arousal disorders but are more stereotypic, occur multiple times nightly
- **Alcohol-induced Blackouts:** disruption of memory for events during drinking episode, behaviors indistinguishable from those seen in NREM sleep arousal disorders
- **Dissociative Amnesia with Dissociative Fugue:** arises from wakefulness rather than sleep and is associated with a history of childhood physical or sexual abuse
- **Malingering or Other Voluntary Behavior Occurring During Wakefulness:** arises from wakefulness, not sleep

**Other Conditions to Consider (Continued):**
- **Panic Disorder:** panic attacks cause abrupt awakenings without confusion, amnesia or motor activity
- **Medication-induced Complex Behaviors:** induced by use or withdrawal of substances or medications, isolated amnesia.

**International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD), 2nd Edition:**
- Includes "confusional arousal" as a NREM sleep arousal disorder.

##### Nightmare Disorder

**Nightmare Disorder (307.47 F51.5)**

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- **A.** Repeated occurrences of extended, extremely dysphoric, and well-remembered dreams during the second half of major sleep episode
  * Involving efforts to avoid threats to survival, security, or physical integrity
  * Occurring during the second half of major sleep episode
- **B.** Rapid orientation and alertness upon awakening from dysphoric dreams
- **C.** Sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
- **D.** Symptoms not attributable to physiological effects of substances (drugs or medications)
- **E.** Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not adequately explain predominant complaint of dysphoric dreams

**Specifiers:**
- During sleep onset
- With associated non-sleep disorder, including substance use disorders
- With associated other medical condition
- With associated other sleep disorder

**Coding Note:**
- Code 307.47 (F51.5) applies to all three specifiers and relevant associated disorders or conditions

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Nightmares: lengthy, elaborated storylike sequences of dream imagery that seem real and induce anxiety, fear, or other dysphoric emotions
- Content focuses on attempts to avoid or cope with imminent danger but may involve negative emotions
- Well remembered and detailed descriptions after awakening
- Occur mainly during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep
  * More likely in the second half of major sleep episode
- Factors increasing early-night REM intensity, such as sleep fragmentation or deprivation, jet lag, and REM-sensitive medications, may facilitate nightmares earlier in the night including at sleep onset
- Dysphoric emotions terminate with awakening but may persist into wakefulness contributing to difficulty returning to sleep and lasting daytime distress
- Some nightmares (bad dreams) may not induce awakening and be recalled later

**Associated Features:**
- Mild autonomic arousal: sweating, tachycardia, tachypnea during nightmares
- Body movements or vocalizations are not characteristic due to REM sleep-related loss of muscle tone but may occur under emotional stress or sleep fragmentation in PTSD.

**Additional Information:**
- Individuals with frequent nightmares at greater risk for suicidal ideation and attempts.

###### Nightmares: Prevalence, Causes, and Consequences Across Age Groups and Sexes

**Prevalence of Nightmares**
- Prevalence increases through childhood into adolescence:
  - 1.3% to 3.9% of parents report nightmares "often" or "always" in preschool children
  - Increases for both males and females from ages 10 to 13
- Higher prevalence for females (twice as high) compared to males in late adolescence and early adulthood (ages 20-29)
- Prevalence decreases steadily with age for both sexes
- In adults, prevalence of nightmares at least monthly is 6%, whereas prevalence for frequent nightmares is 1%-2%

**Development and Course of Nightmares**
- **Nightmares often begin between ages 3 and 6 years**
- Peak prevalence and severity in late adolescence or early adulthood
- May appear in children exposed to acute or chronic psychosocial stressors
- Persist into adulthood for a minority, becoming virtually a life-long disturbance

**Risk Factors for Nightmares**
- **Individuals who experience nightmares report more frequent past adverse events, but not necessarily trauma**
- Display personality disturbances or psychiatric diagnosis
- Environmental: Sleep deprivation, fragmentation, and irregular sleep-wake schedules
- Genetic and physiological: Twin studies identify genetic effects on the disposition to nightmares
- **Adaptive parental bedside behaviors** may protect against developing chronic nightmares

**Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues**
- Significance attributed to nightmares may vary by culture, with sensitivity to beliefs facilitating disclosure

**Gender Differences in Nightmares**
- Adult females report having nightmares more frequently than do adult males
- Female nightmare themes: sexual harassment or loved ones disappearing/dying
- Male nightmare themes: physical aggression or war/terror

**Diagnostic Markers of Nightmare Disorder**
- Polysomnographic studies demonstrate abrupt awakenings from REM sleep, usually during the second half of the night, prior to report of a nightmare
- Heart, respiratory, and eye movement rates may quicken or increase in variability before awakening
- Nightmares following traumatic events may also arise during non-REM (NREM), particularly stage 2 sleep

**Functional Consequences of Nightmare Disorder**
- Causes more significant subjective distress than demonstrable social or occupational impairment
- If awakenings are frequent or result in sleep avoidance, individuals may experience excessive daytime sleepiness, poor concentration, depression, anxiety, or irritability
- Frequent childhood nightmares (e.g., several per week) can cause significant distress to parents and child

###### Differentiating Nightmare Disorder from Other Sleep Disturbances

**Differential Diagnosis of Sleep Disturbances:**

**Sleep Terror Disorder vs Nightmare Disorder**
- **Sleep terror disorder**: Arises in first third of night during NREM sleep, leads to partial awakenings with confusion and disorientation, no dream recall or images with no storylike quality, amnesia upon waking.
- **Nightmare disorder**: Occurs later in the night during REM sleep, produces vivid dreams with clear recall, mild autonomic arousal, complete awakenings.

**Additional Differentiators:**
- **REM Sleep Behavior Disorder**: Complex motor activity during frightening dreams, violent dream enactments, nocturnal injuries, controlled by medication.
- **Bereavement**: Dysphoric dreams involve loss and sadness, self-reflection upon awakening.
- **Narcolepsy**: Excessive sleepiness, cataplexy, nocturnal seizures or repetitive nightmares with epileptogenic features.
- **Nocturnal Seizures**: Stereotypical motor activity during sleep, rare occurrence of nightmares reflecting seizure content.
- **Breathing-related Sleep Disorders**: Autonomic arousal without recall of nightmares.
- **Panic Disorder**: Abrupt awakenings with fearfulness and autonomic arousal similar to panic attacks during wakefulness, no reported nightmares.

**Medication or Substance Use:**
- Nightmares as a symptom of various medications or substances: dopaminergics, beta-adrenergic antagonists, amphetamines, cocaine, antidepressants, smoking cessation aids, melatonin.

**Comorbidities:**
- Nightmares may accompany medical conditions like coronary heart disease, cancer, parkinsonism and pain or treatments such as hemodialysis or medication withdrawal.
- Frequently comorbid with mental disorders: PTSD, insomnia disorder, schizophrenia, psychosis, mood anxiety adjustment and personality disorders, grief during bereavement.

**International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2):**
- Similar diagnostic criteria for nightmare disorder as presented in the text.

##### Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder

**Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep Behavior Disorder**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **327.42 (G47.52)** ICD-10 code
- A. Repeated episodes of arousal during sleep associated with:
  - Vocalization and/or complex motor behaviors
  - Arise during REM sleep, usually more than 90 minutes after sleep onset
  - More frequent in later portions of the sleep period
  - Uncommon during daytime naps
- B. Upon awakening:
  - Immediately awake, alert, and oriented
  - Not confused or disoriented
- C. One of the following:
  1. REM sleep without atonia on polysomnographic recording
  2. History suggestive of REM sleep behavior disorder and an established synucleinopathy diagnosis (e.g., Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy)
- D. Clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning due to the behavior
- E. Not attributable to physiological effects of a substance (e.g., drugs, medications) or another medical condition
- F. Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not explain the episodes
- **Diagnostic Features**:
  - Repeated episodes of arousal during REM sleep with vocalizations and/or complex motor behaviors (Criteria A and B)
  - Dream enacting behaviors reflecting motor responses to dream content of attacking or escaping from threatening situations
  - Vocalizations are often loud, emotion-filled, and profane
  - Potential for violent or injurious behaviors (falling, jumping, running, punching, thrusting, hitting, kicking)
  - Upon awakening, individual is immediately awake, alert, and oriented (Criterion C)
  - Determination of severity based on nature or consequence of the behavior rather than frequency

###### Risk Factors and Consequences of REM Sleep Behavior Disorder

**Prevalence of REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RSBD)**
- Approximately 0.38%-0.5% prevalence in general population
- Greater prevalence in patients with psychiatric disorders, possibly related to medications
- Gradual or rapid onset, usually progressive course
- High association with neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies)
- Increasingly identified in females and younger individuals, particularly young females may have symptoms of narcolepsy or medication-induced RSBD

**Risk Factors**
- Genetic and physiological causes
- Medications: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers (may result in polysomnographic evidence of REM sleep without atonia and frank RSBD)
- Unknown if medications cause RSBD or unmask underlying predisposition

**Polysomnography Findings**
- Increased tonic and/or phasic electromyographic activity during REM sleep, affecting various muscle groups
- Mandatory continuous video monitoring
- Other non-REM sleep findings: very frequent periodic and aperiodic extremity electromyography activity (termed REM sleep without atonia)

**Diagnostic Markers**
- Clinical dream-enacting behaviors coupled with polysomnographic finding of REM without atonia is necessary for diagnosis
- Isolated REM sleep without atonia without clinical history is an asymptomatic observation, not a precursor to RSBD.

###### Differential Diagnosis of REM Sleep Behavior Disorder

**Differential Diagnosis of REM Sleep Behavior Disorder**

**Other Parasomnias**:
- **Confusional arousals**, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors can be confused with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBSD)
- These disorders occur in younger individuals
- Arise from deep NREM sleep, tend to occur early in the sleep period
- Awakening is associated with confusion, disorientation, and incomplete recall of dream mentation
- Polysomnographic monitoring reveals normal REM atonia

**Nocturnal Seizures**:
- Can perfectly mimic RBSD
- Behaviors are more stereotyped compared to RBSD
- Polysomnographic monitoring using a full electroencephalographic seizure montage can differentiate the two
- **REM sleep without atonia** is not present on polysomnography in RBSD

**Obstructive Sleep Apnea**:
- Behaviors may be indistinguishable from RBSD
- Polysomnographic monitoring necessary to differentiate the two
- Symptoms resolve following effective treatment of obstructive sleep apnea

**Other Specified Dissociative Disorder (Sleep-Related Psychogenic Dissociative Behaviors)**:
- Unlike other parasomnias, these behaviors arise from a period of well-defined wakefulness during the sleep period
- More prevalent in young females
- **Malingering**: Many cases mimic RBSD, requiring polysomnographic documentation

**Comorbidity with Narcolepsy**:
- Approximately 30% of patients with narcolepsy have concurrent RBSD
- Demographics reflect the younger age range of narcolepsy, with equal frequency in males and females

**Long-Term Outcomes**:
- Most individuals (>50%) with initially "idiopathic" RBSD will eventually develop a neurodegenerative disease, most notably, one of the synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, or major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies)
- RBSD often predates other signs of these disorders by many years (often more than a decade)

**International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2)**:
- REM sleep behavior disorder is virtually identical to the definition in ICSD-2

##### Restless Legs Syndrome

**Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **333.94 (G25.81)**: The diagnostic code for RLS
- **A. Urge to Move the Legs**: Characterized by:
  - Unpleasant sensations in the legs, often described as creeping, crawling, tingling, burning, or itching
  - Urge to move the legs begins/worsens during rest or inactivity
  - Relief of symptoms upon movement
  - Worse in the evening or night than daytime
- **B. Frequency**: Symptoms occur at least three times per week and have persisted for at least 3 months
- **C. Distress/Impairment**: Symptoms cause significant distress or impairment in important areas of functioning
- **D. Exclusions**: Not attributable to another mental disorder, medical condition, or drug abuse/medication effects
- **E. Substance-Related Exceptions**: Not attributable to the physiological effects of a drug of abuse or medication (e.g., akathisia)

**Associated Features**:
- **Periodic Leg Movements in Sleep (PLMS)**: Can serve as corroborating evidence for RLS
- **Periodic Leg Movements During Wakefulness**: Supportive of an RLS diagnosis
- **Sleep Disturbances**: Delayed sleep onset, frequent awakenings, and excessive daytime sleepiness
- **Family History**: RLS in first-degree relatives
- **Treatment Response**: Initial relief with dopaminergic treatment

###### Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Impact of Restless Legs Syndrome

**Prevalence of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)**
- Prevalence rates vary widely from 2% to 7.2%, depending on criteria used
- When frequency is at least three times per week with moderate or severe distress: 1.6% prevalence rate
- When frequency is a minimum of one time per week: 4.5% prevalence rate
- Females are 1.5-2 times more likely than males to have RLS
- Prevalence increases with age, up to about age 60, then remains stable or decreases in older age groups
- Lower prevalence in Asian populations

**Features of RLS**
- Onset typically occurs in second or third decade of life
- Approximately 40% report symptoms before age 20, 20% before age 10
- Symptoms remain stable or decrease slightly with age
- Nocturnal worsening is common, even in children and adolescents
- Negative impact on sleep, mood, cognition, and function

**Risk and Prognostic Factors for RLS**
- Female gender, advancing age, genetic risk variants, family history increase risk
- Precipitating factors are often time-limited, such as iron deficiency
- Genetic susceptibility and disturbances in central dopaminergic system and iron metabolism play a role

**Diagnostic Considerations for RLS in Children**
- Difficult to diagnose due to self-report component
- Children report symptoms in their own words rather than by parents/caretakers
- Two-thirds report daytime leg sensations, which can complicate diagnosis of nocturnal worsening

**Impact of RLS on Daily Functioning**
- Significant impairment in approximately 2%-3% of the population
- Up to 50% report negative impact on mood
- Affects sleep, education, occupational functioning, and social interactions.

###### Differential Diagnosis and Comorbidities of Restless Legs Syndrome

**Differential Diagnosis of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)**
- **Conditions to be differentiated from RLS:**
  - Leg cramps: relief with a single postural shift, limitation to joints, soreness on palpation (myalgias)
  - Positional discomfort
  - Arthralgia/arthritis
  - Myalgias
  - Positional ischemia (numbness)
  - Leg edema
  - Peripheral neuropathy
  - Radiculopathy
  *Characteristics not typical of RLS:*
  - "Knotting" or cramps: no desire to move limbs, frequent movements
  - Neuroleptic-induced akathisia
  - Myelopathy
  - Symptomatic venous insufficiency
  - Peripheral artery disease
  - Eczema
  - Other orthopedic problems
  *Less common conditions:*
  - Worsening at night and periodic limb movements more common in RLS than in medication-induced akathisia or peripheral neuropathy
  - When uncertain diagnosis, evaluation for supportive features of RLS (PLMS, family history) may be helpful
  *Clinical features to aid Differential Diagnosis:*
  - Response to dopaminergic agent
  - Positive family history for RLS
  - Comorbidities: depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, attentional disorders (functional consequences of RLS)
  - Cardiovascular disease and its associated conditions: hypertension, narcolepsy, migraine, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, fibromyalgia, osteoporosis, obesity, thyroid disease, and cancer.
  - Iron deficiency, pregnancy, chronic renal failure
- **International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2):**
  - Similar diagnostic criteria as for RLS
  - No criterion specifying frequency or duration of symptoms.

##### Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder

**Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder**

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- A prominent and severe disturbance in sleep
- There is evidence of:
  1. Symptoms developing during or soon after substance intoxication or medication withdrawal
  2. The involved substance/medication capable of producing the symptoms
- The disturbance not better explained by an independent sleep disorder

**Coding:**
- ICD-9-CM codes for specific substances/medications (see table)
  - Substance use disorder: "mild," "moderate," or "severe" specified in 4th position character
  - Tobacco-induced sleep disorder requires a moderate or severe tobacco use disorder
- ICD-10-CM codes depend on whether a comorbid substance use disorder is present for the same class of substance
  - With use: code for substance/medication and "onset during intoxication"
  - Without disorder, moderate use: code for substance/medication and "withdrawal"
  - Without disorder, mild or severe: code for substance/medication only
- Specify type of sleep disturbance (insomnia, daytime sleepiness, parasomnia, mixed)

**Coding Example:**
- Alcohol: ICD-9-CM 291.82 (F10.182), ICD-10-CM F10.188
  - With onset during intoxication
  - Insomnia type
- Lorazepam: ICD-9-CM 292.85 (F13.182), ICD-10-CM F13.188
  - Onset during withdrawal
  - Insomnia type

**Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder vs. Intoxication or Withdrawal:**
- Diagnosis of substance intoxication or withdrawal only when symptoms predominate and are severe enough to warrant clinical attention.

###### Substance-Induced Sleep Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

**Diagnostic Features of Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder**

**Essential Feature**:
- Prominent sleep disturbance that warrants independent clinical attention (Criterion A)
- Judged to be primarily associated with the pharmacological effects of a substance (i.e., drug of abuse, medication, toxin exposure) (Criterion B)

**Types of Sleep Disturbances**:
- **Insomnia type**
- **Daytime sleepiness type**
- **Parasomnia type**
- **Mixed type**: More than one type of sleep disturbance is present, but none predominates

**Distinguishing Features**:
- Not better explained by another sleep disorder (Criterion C)
- Diagnosis not made if the sleep disturbance occurs only during a delirium (Criterion D)
- Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criteria E)

**Distinguishing from Other Sleep Disorders**:
- Substance/medication-induced sleep disorder arises only in association with **intoxication or discontinuation/withdrawal states**, while other sleep disorders may precede onset of substance use or occur during times of sustained abstinence
- For drugs of abuse, there must be evidence of **intoxication or withdrawal** from history, physical examination, or laboratory findings
- Symptoms may have atypical features, such as late onset or unusual course, in cases of discontinuation/withdrawal

###### Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

**Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis:**

**Substance/Medication Use, Intoxication, or Withdrawal**:
- Dysphoric mood: depression, anxiety, irritability, cognitive impairment, inability to concentrate, and fatigue
- Sleep disturbances: prominent and severe
  - Alcohol: insomnia type during acute intoxication, reduced slow-wave sleep and increased REM sleep during withdrawal
  - Caffeine: dose-dependent insomnia, daytime sleepiness related to withdrawal
  - Cannabis: shortened sleep latency, enhanced slow-wave sleep, suppressed REM sleep with tolerance and withdrawal
  - Opioids: increased sleepiness and decreased REM sleep during acute use, exacerbation of sleep apnea, insomnia during withdrawal
  - Sedative-hypnotic drugs: increased sleepiness and decreased wakefulness during acute intoxication, tolerance and return of insomnia with chronic use, daytime sedation, withdrawal or rebound insomnia
  - Stimulants: insomnia during intoxication, excessive sleepiness during withdrawal
- Medications: adrenergic agonists and antagonists, dopamine agonists and antagonists, cholinergic agonists and antagonists, serotonergic agonists and antagonists, antihistamines, corticosteroids can induce sleep disturbances

**Cannabis**:
- Acute administration: shortened sleep latency, enhanced slow-wave sleep, suppressed REM sleep
- Chronic use/withdrawal: reduced slow-wave sleep and increased REM sleep, sleep difficulties and unpleasant dreams lasting for several weeks

**Opioids**:
- Acute intoxication: increased sleepiness and decreased wakefulness, decreased REM sleep
- Withdrawal: disrupted sleep continuity, increased amount and intensity of REM sleep associated with vivid dreaming (constituting part of alcohol withdrawal delirium)

**Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Substances**:
- Sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines receptor agonists, meprobamate, glutethimide, methyprylon) have similar effects as opioids on sleep
  - Acute intoxication: increased sleepiness and decreased wakefulness
  - Chronic use: tolerance with subsequent return of insomnia, daytime sedation, withdrawal or rebound insomnia
  - Withdrawal/rebound: exacerbation of insomnia upon drug discontinuation for 1-2 days, even with short-term use

**Amphetamines and Related Substances/Stimulants**:
- Insomnia during intoxication, excessive sleepiness during withdrawal
- Acute intoxication: reduced total amount of sleep, increased sleep latency and sleep continuity disruptions, decreased REM sleep
- Withdrawal from chronic stimulant use: prolonged nocturnal sleep duration and excessive daytime sleepiness

**Tobacco**:
- Chronic consumption: insomnia, decreased slow-wave sleep with reduced sleep efficiency, increased daytime sleepiness
- Withdrawal: impaired sleep

**Other/Unknown Substances/Medications**:
- Other substances/medications may produce sleep disturbances, particularly those affecting the central or autonomic nervous systems (e.g., adrenergic agonists and antagonists, dopamine agonists and antagonists, cholinergic agonists and antagonists, serotonergic agonists and antagonists, antihistamines, corticosteroids)

**Development and Course**:
- Insomnia in children can be identified by parents or the child
- Prevalence of substance use is higher in adolescence and early adulthood
- Help-seeking behavior for sleep disturbances is limited in younger age groups, making corroborative reporting from a parent, caregiver, or teacher important
- Older individuals take more medications and are at increased risk for developing substance/medication-induced sleep disorders
- Individuals with major neurocognitive disorder (e.g., dementia) are at risk for substance/medication-induced sleep disorders but may not report symptoms, making corroborative reporting from caregivers particularly important

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**:
- Substance use generally precipitates or accompanies insomnia in vulnerable individuals, representing a risk for developing substance/medication-induced sleep disorders
- Culture-related diagnostic issues: consumption of substances, including prescribed medications, may depend on cultural background and local drug regulations
- Gender-specific prevalences exist for patterns of consumption of some substances (e.g., alcohol) and can lead to different sleep outcomes based on gender differences

###### Diagnostic Markers

**Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorders**

**Diagnostic Markers:**
- Each substance produces distinct electroencephalographic sleep patterns based on stage of use (intake, chronic, withdrawal)
- Polysomnography for severity assessment: insomnia complaints and daytime sleepiness
- Monitoring nocturnal respiration, limb movements during polysomnography to verify impact on breathing and behavior
- Sleep diaries, actigraphy, drug screening useful in confirming presence of disorder

**Functional Consequences:**
- Increased risk for relapse during alcohol withdrawal
- Monitoring sleep quality and daytime sleepiness during/after withdrawal can indicate risk of relapse

**Differential Diagnosis:**
1. Substance intoxication or withdrawal: make diagnosis only when sleep disturbance is predominant and severe
2. Delirium: no diagnosis if symptoms occur exclusively within delirium
3. Other sleep disorders: distinguish based on etiological relationship, timing of onset, and persistence of symptoms after treatment discontinuation
4. Sleep disorder due to another medical condition or comorbidity: important to consider chronology of symptoms in distinguishing between sources of sleep symptoms
5. If insufficient evidence to determine attribution to substance/medication or other medical condition, diagnose as other specified or unspecified sleep-wake disorder.

##### Other Specified Insomnia Disorder

**Insomnia Disorder (780.52)**
- **Other Specified Insomnia Disorder**:
  - Applies to presentations where symptoms of insomnia disorder are prevalent but do not meet full criteria for diagnosis or any sleep-wake disorders
  - Can be specified with a reason, such as "brief insomnia disorder" (duration less than 3 months) or "restricted to nonrestorative sleep" (predominant complaint is nonrestorative sleep without other sleep symptoms)
- **Unspecified Insomnia Disorder**:
  - Applies to presentations where symptoms of insomnia disorder are prevalent but do not meet full criteria for diagnosis or any sleep-wake disorders
  - Used when there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis

**Hypersomnolence Disorder (780.54)**
- **Other Specified Hypersomnolence Disorder**:
  - Applies to presentations where symptoms of hypersomnolence disorder are prevalent but do not meet full criteria for diagnosis or any sleep-wake disorders
  - Can be specified with a reason, such as "brief-duration hypersomnolence" (e.g., Kieine-Levin syndrome)
- **Unspecified Hypersomnolence Disorder**:
  - Applies to presentations where symptoms of hypersomnolence disorder are prevalent but do not meet full criteria for diagnosis or any sleep-wake disorders
  - Used when there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis

**Other Specified Sleep-Wake Disorder (780.59)**
- Applies to presentations where symptoms characteristic of a sleep-wake disorder cause clinically significant distress or impairment but do not meet criteria for any specific sleep-wake disorders
- The other specified sleep-wake disorder category is used when the presentation does not qualify for "other specified insomnia disorder" or "other specified hypersomnolence disorder," and the reason for not meeting criteria should be communicated by recording "other specified sleep-wave disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g., "repeated arousals during rapid eye movement sleep without polysomnography or history of Parkinson's disease or other synucleinopathy")

##### Unspecified Sleep-Wake Disorder

**Unspecified Sleep-Wake Disorder (780.59, G47 .9)**

**Characteristics:**
- Symptoms of a sleep-wake disorder causing clinically significant distress or impairment in various areas of life
- Do not meet full criteria for any specific sleep-wake disorder diagnosis
- No qualification as unspecified insomnia disorder or unspecified hypersomnolence disorder

**Use:**
- For presentations where the criteria are not met for a specific sleep-wake disorder diagnosis
- When sufficient information is lacking to make a more specific diagnosis

**Clinical Significance:**
- Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

### Sexual Dysfunctions

**Sexual Dysfunctions:**
- **Types:** Delayed ejaculation, erectile disorder, female orgasmic disorder, female sexual interest/arousal disorder, genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder, male hypoactive sexual desire disorder, premature (early) ejaculation, substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction, other specified sexual dysfunction, unspecified sexual dysfunction
- Characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in sexual response or pleasure
- Individuals may have multiple sexual dysfunctions
- Diagnosis requires considering factors: partner factors, relationship factors, individual vulnerability factors, cultural/religious factors, medical factors
- Subtypes: lifelong, acquired, generalized, situational

**Assessment:**
- Consider cultural influences on expectations and prohibitions about sexual pleasure
- Aging may affect normal decrease in sexual response
- Sexual function involves biological, sociocultural, psychological factors
- Precise etiology of a sexual problem unknown in many cases
- Rule out nonsexual mental disorders, substance abuse, medical conditions, or relationship problems as primary causes before making a diagnosis

**Sexual Dysfunction Diagnosis:**
- If better explained by another mental disorder: diagnose only the other disorder
- If attributed to drug/substance use: diagnose accordingly as substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction
- If caused by medical condition: no psychiatric diagnosis
- If severe relationship distress, partner violence, or significant stressors better explain difficulties: no sexual dysfunction diagnosis but appropriate V or Z code for the problem may be listed.

#### Delayed Ejaculation

**Delayed Ejaculation**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **Criterion A**: Marked delay in or absence of ejaculation on almost all occasions of partnered sexual activity (approximately 75%-100%) without desire for delay.
- **Criterion B**: Symptoms have persisted for a minimum of 6 months and cause clinically significant distress.
- **Criterion C**: Sexual dysfunction not better explained by non-sexual mental disorder, relationship distress, substance/medication use, or medical condition.
- Specify whether: Lifelong vs. Acquired, Generalized vs. Situational

**Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis**:
- Prolonged thrusting to achieve orgasm and exhaustion or genital discomfort
- Avoidance of sexual activity due to repeated difficulty ejaculating
- Sexual partner's feelings of less sexual attractiveness due to partner's inability to ejaculate easily

**Factors Considered**:
1. Partner factors (e.g., partner's sexual problems, health status)
2. Relationship factors (e.g., poor communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity)
3. Individual vulnerability factors (e.g., body image issues, history of sexual or emotional abuse, psychiatric comorbidity, stressors)
4. Cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions on sexual activity, attitudes toward sexuality)
5. Medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, and treatment

**Prevalence**:
- Unclear due to lack of precise definition
- Least common male sexual complaint
- Only 1% of men report problems with reaching ejaculation lasting more than 6 months

**Development and Course**:
- Lifelong delayed ejaculation begins in early sexual experiences and continues throughout life
- Acquired delayed ejaculation begins after a period of normal sexual function
- Prevalence increases significantly in men over age 50 due to age-related factors (e.g., nerve loss, decreased sex steroid secretion)

**Risk Factors**:
- Age-related loss of fast-conducting peripheral sensory nerves and decreased sex steroid secretion in men over 50
- Cultural or genetic differences between cultures

**Functional Consequences**:
- Difficulty with ejaculation may contribute to difficulties in conception
- Delayed ejaculation often associated with considerable psychological distress in one or both partners

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Distinguish between delayed ejaculation fully explained by another medical illness/injury vs. psychogenic, idiopathic, or combined etiology
- Situational aspect of the complaint suggests a psychological basis (e.g., ability to ejaculate with one partner but not others)
- Delayed ejaculation may be caused by interruption of nerve supply to the genitals (e.g., traumatic surgical injury, abdominoperitoneal surgery, lumbar sympathectomy) or neurodegenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis and diabetic neuropathy
- Delayed ejaculation should be differentiated from retrograde ejaculation (i.e., ejaculation into the bladder) following transurethral prostate resection
- Delayed ejaculation versus decreased pleasure (anhedonic ejaculation), which would not be coded as delayed ejaculation but could be other specified or unspecified sexual dysfunction

**Comorbidity**:
- Some evidence suggests a relationship between severe forms of major depressive disorder and delayed ejaculation.

#### Erectile Disorder

**Erectile Dysfunction (ED)**

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- **302.72 (F52.21)**: At least one of the following symptoms experienced on almost all sexual activities:
  * Marked difficulty obtaining an erection
  * Marked difficulty maintaining an erection until completion of activity
  * Marked decrease in erectile rigidity
- Symptoms persist for a minimum duration of approximately **6 months**
- Symptoms cause clinically significant distress
- Not better explained by other mental disorders or stressors, or due to substances/medications or medical conditions

**Subtypes:**
- **Lifelong**: Disturbance present since becoming sexually active
- **Acquired**: Disturbance began after normal function
- **Generalized**: Not limited to specific situations, types of stimulation, or partners
- **Situational**: Occurs with certain stimulation, situations, or partners only

**Associated Features:**
- Low self-esteem and confidence
- Decreased sense of masculinity
- Fear and avoidance of future sexual encounters
- Decreased sexual satisfaction in partner
- Reduced sexual desire

**Assessment Considerations:**
- **Partner factors**: Partner's sexual problems, health status
- **Relationship factors**: Poor communication, desire discrepancies
- **Individual vulnerability factors**: Body image issues, sexual/emotional abuse history, psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety), stressors (job loss, bereavement)
- **Cultural/religious factors**: Inhibitions related to sexual activity and attitudes towards it
- **Medical factors**: Prognosis, course, treatment relevance

###### Erectile Dysfunction: Prevalence, Diagnosis, and Impact on Relationships

**Prevalence and Development of Erectile Dysfunction:**
- Unknown prevalence of lifelong vs. acquired ED
- Age-related increase in problems with erections: 13%-21% men ages 40-80, 40%-50% over 60
- Approx. 2% younger men have frequent problems, 20% fear on first sexual experience
- Development and course: minimal recovery for some, persistent in most with acquired ED

**Risk Factors:**
- Neurotic personality traits associated with college students
- Submissive personality traits older than 40 years
- Alexithymia common in men diagnosed with "psychogenic" erectile dysfunction
- Depression and posttraumatic stress disorder linked to ED
- Age, smoking, lack of physical exercise, diabetes, decreased desire risk factors for acquired ED

**Diagnostic Procedures:**
- Nocturnal penile tumescence testing and measured erectile turgidity during sleep
- Doppler ultrasonography, invasive diagnostic procedures like dynamic infusion cavernosography
- Serum bioavailable or free testosterone assessment in men with decreased sexual desire
- Thyroid function evaluation
- Determination of fasting serum glucose and lipids to screen for diabetes and heart disease

**Consequences:**
- Interference with fertility and intimate relationships
- Individual distress
- Fear and avoidance of sexual encounters.

###### Differentiai Diagnosis

**Differential Diagnosis for Erectile Dysfunction**

**Nonsexual Mental Disorders**:
- Major depressive disorder and erectile dysorder are closely associated
- Erectile dysfunction accompanying severe depressive disorder may occur

**Normal Erections**:
- Consideration of normal erectile function in men with excessive expectations

**Substance/Medication Use**:
- Another major Differential Diagnosis is whether the erectile problem is secondary to substance/medication use
- Onset coincides with beginning of substance/medication use and dissipates with discontinuation or dose reduction suggests substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction

**Medical Conditions**:
- Difficult aspect in Differential Diagnosis is ruling out erectile problems fully explained by medical factors
- Distinction between **erectile disorder as a mental disorder** and **erectile dysfunction as a result of another medical condition** is unclear
- If older than 40-50 years with concomitant medical problems, Differential Diagnosis should include **vascular disease**
- Presence of an organic disease known to cause erectile problems does not confirm causal relationship (e.g., diabetes mellitus and psychogenic causes)
- Erectile dysfunction due to organic factors is generally gradual onset, except for post-traumatic injury to nervous innervation
- **Erectile problems that are situational, inconsistent, and have acute onset after a stressful life event** are most often due to psychological events

**Other Sexual Dysfunctions**:
- Erectile dysfunction may coexist with premature (early) ejaculation and male hypoactive sexual desire disorder
- Comorbidity with anxiety and depression disorders is also possible
- Common in men with lower urinary tract symptoms related to prostatic hypertrophy
- May be comorbid with **dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, hypogonadism, multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and other diseases that interfere with vascular, neurological, or endocrine function** necessary for normal erectile function

**Relation to International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10)**:
- Erectile response is coded as **failure of genital response (F2.2)** in ICD-10.

#### Female Orgasmic Disorder

**Female Orgasmic Disorder**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **Criterion A**:
  - Presence of either:
    - Marked delay in, marked infrequency of, or absence of orgasm
    - Markedly reduced intensity of orgasmic sensations
  - Applies to almost all (approx. 75%-100%) occasions of sexual activity (in specific situations or generally)

- **Criterion B**: Symptoms have persisted for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months
- **Criterion C**: Symptoms cause clinically significant distress in the individual
- **Criteria D**: Sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder, substance/medication use, or medical condition

**Specifying the Disorder**:
- Lifelong: Disturbance present since sexual activity began
- Acquired: Disturbance began after period of normal sexual function
- Generalized: Not limited to certain types of stimulation, situations, or partners
- Situational: Only occurs with specific types of stimulation, situations, or partners
- Never experienced an orgasm under any situation

**Current Severity**: Mild, Moderate, Severe based on distress over symptoms

**Female Orgasmic Disorder Characteristics**:
- Difficulty experiencing orgasm and/or markedly reduced intensity of orgasmic sensations
- Women exhibit wide variability in type/intensity of stimulation eliciting orgasm
- Subjective descriptions of orgasm are extremely varied across women and situations

**Assessment and Diagnosis**:
- Consider interpersonal, relationship, individual vulnerability, cultural/religious, and medical factors that may be relevant to etiology and treatment
- Determine whether symptoms are a result of inadequate sexual stimulation rather than a clinical diagnosis

###### Female Orgasm Disorders: Prevalence, Causes, and Functional Consequences

**Prevalence of Female Orgasmic Problems in Women:**
- Reported prevalence rates vary from 10% to 42%, depending on factors like age, culture, duration, and severity of symptoms
- Approximately 10% of women don't experience orgasm throughout their lifetime
- Prevalence rates influenced by how symptoms are assessed (e.g., duration, recall period)

**Development and Course:**
- Lifelong vs. acquired subtypes based on presence or absence of difficulties from the start
- Age at first orgasm varies for women more than men
- Women learn to experience orgasm with stimulation and knowledge about their bodies
- Consistency of orgasm higher during masturbation than partnered sex

**Risk Factors:**
*Temperamental:* anxiety, concerns about pregnancy
*Environmental:* relationship problems, physical health issues, mental health concerns, gender role expectations, religious norms
*Genetic and physiological:* medical conditions (e.g., multiple sclerosis), medications (SSRIs), vulvovaginal atrophy, menopausal status
*Interactions:* psychological, sociocultural, and physiological factors influence experience of orgasm and difficulties

**Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues:**
- Perception of lack of orgasm as a problem may vary depending on cultural context
- Women differ in how important orgasm is for their sexual satisfaction
*Sociocultural and generational differences:* prevalence rates range from 17.7% (Northern Europe) to 42.2% (Southeast Asia)

**Diagnostic Markers:**
- Measurable physiological changes during female orgasm, but significant variation among women
- Diagnosis based on self-reported orgasmic difficulties

**Functional Consequences:**
- Association between relationship problems and orgasmic difficulties in women unclear
- Whether relationship factors are risks or consequences of orgasmic difficulties is uncertain.

###### Diagnostic Criteria for Female Orgasmic Disorder: DSM-5 Analysis

**Differential Diagnosis for Female Orgasmic Disorder:**

**Nonsexual mental disorders**:
- Major depressive disorder (markedly diminished interest or pleasure) can explain orgasmic difficulties
- If the difficulties are better explained by another mental disorder, female orgasmic disorder diagnosis would not be made

**Substance/medication use**:
- Substance/medication use may explain the orgasmic difficulties

**Medical conditions**:
- Another medical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) can cause orgasmic difficulties, so a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be made

**Interpersonal factors**:
- If interpersonal or significant contextual factors (severe relationship distress, intimate partner violence, other stressors) are associated with the orgasmic difficulties, a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be made

**Other sexual dysfunctions**:
- Female orgasmic disorder may occur in association with other sexual dysfunctions (e.g., female sexual interest/arousal disorder)
- The presence of another sexual dysfunction does not rule out a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder
- Occasional or short-term orgasmic difficulties without significant distress or impairment are not diagnosed as female orgasmic disorder
- Problems caused by inadequate sexual stimulation are also not considered a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder

**Comorbidity**:
- Women with female orgasmic disorder may have co-occurring sexual interest/arousal difficulties
- Women with diagnoses of other nonsexual mental disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder) may experience lower sexual interest/arousal, increasing the likelihood of orgasmic difficulties.

#### Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder

**Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (F52.22)**

**Criteria for Diagnosis**:
- **Criterion A**: Lack of or significantly reduced sexual interest/arousal, manifested by at least 3 of the following:
  - Absent/reduced interest in sexual activity
  - Absent/reduced sexual/erotic thoughts or fantasies
  - No/reduced initiation of sexual activity and reluctance to respond to partner's attempts
  - Absent/reduced sexual excitement/pleasure during sexual activity (almost all encounters)
  - Absent/reduced response to internal/external sexual stimuli
  - Absent/reduced genital or nongenital sensations during sexual activity (almost all encounters)
- **Criterion B**: Symptoms have persisted for a minimum of 6 months
- **Criterion C**: Clinically significant distress due to symptoms
- **Criterion D**: Not attributable to other mental disorders, relationship issues, or substance/medication use/other medical conditions

**Specifiers**:
- Lifelong: Disturbance present since becoming sexually active
- Acquired: Disturbance began after normal sexual function
- Generalized or situational based on whether the issue is with certain types of stimuli, situations, or partners
- Current severity: Mild, Moderate, Severe

**Assessment Considerations**:
- Interpersonal context must be considered (e.g., "desire discrepancy" between partners)
- Short-term changes are normal and not indicative of disorder
- Minimum duration of symptoms is required to establish diagnosis
- Normal age-related decline in sexual thoughts should be taken into account
- Absence or reduced frequency/intensity of interest, thoughts, or fantasies may indicate "hypoactive sexual desire disorder" (previously termed "hypoactive sexual desire")
- Clinically significant distress must accompany the symptoms
- Associated features: Difficulties with orgasm, pain during sex, infrequent activity, couple-level discrepancies in desire, relationship difficulties, mood disorders, unrealistic expectations and poor sexual techniques/lack of information about sexuality.

**Factors to Consider**:
- Partner factors (e.g., partner's sexual problems, health status)
- Relationship factors (e.g., communication, desire discrepancies)
- Individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image, history of abuse)
- Psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety) or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement)
- Cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality)
- Medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment.

###### Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder: Diagnosis and Factors

**Prevalence of Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder**
- Prevalence unknown for this disorder as defined by manual
- Estimates vary based on: age, cultural setting, duration of symptoms, and distress level
- Distinction between short-term and persistent problems
  - Shorter symptoms may have lower prevalence when distress is required
  - Older women may report less distress about low desire than younger ones

**Criteria for Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder**
- **Lifetime:** if lack of sexual interest or arousal present since first sexual experiences (A3, A4, A6)
- **Acquired:** if difficulties developed after nonproblematic functioning
- Adaptive changes may be normative, but persistence > 6 months considered dysfunction

**Risk Factors for Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder**
- Temperamental: negative cognitions and attitudes about sexuality, mental disorders history
- Environmental: relationship difficulties, partner sexual functioning, childhood stressors
- Genetic and physiological: medical conditions like diabetes or thyroid dysfunction, strong influence of genetic factors

**Cultural Considerations**
- Prevalence rates vary across cultures, East Asian women may have lower desire
- Diagnosis must take into account cultural norms and pathologization

**Gender-Related Issues**
- Only diagnosed for women; male hypoactive sexual desire disorder applies to men

**Functional Consequences of Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder**
- Decreased relationship satisfaction

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Other nonsexual mental disorders, substance use or medication effects, other medical conditions, interpersonal factors, comorbidities (other sexual dysfunctions, depression, anxiety, etc.)

**Transient and Adaptive Alterations in Sexual Functioning**
- Must consider when making differential diagnosis.

#### Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder

**Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (F52.6)**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- Persistent or recurrent difficulties with one or more of the following:
  - Vaginal penetration during intercourse
  - Marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during vaginal intercourse or penetration attempts
  - Marked fear or anxiety about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain in anticipation of, during, or as a result of vaginal penetration
  - Marked tensing or tightening of the pelvic floor muscles during attempted vaginal penetration
- The symptoms have persisted for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months
- Cause clinically significant distress in the individual
- Not better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder, relationship distress, substance/medication use, or medical condition

**Symptom Dimensions**:
1. Difficulty with vaginal intercourse/penetration
2. Genito-pelvic pain
3. Fear of pain or vaginal penetration
4. Tension of the pelvic floor muscles

**Specifiers**:
- Lifelong: The disturbance has been present since sexual activity began
- Acquired: The disturbance began after a period of normal sexual function

**Severity Levels**:
- Mild: Evidence of mild distress over symptoms
- Moderate: Evidence of moderate distress over symptoms
- Severe: Evidence of severe or extreme distress over symptoms

**Associated Features**:
- Reduced sexual desire and interest (female sexual interest/arousal disorder)
- Avoidance of sexual/intimate situations
- Avoidance of gynecological examinations
- Difficulty conceiving despite wanting intercourse
- Relationship problems
- Diminished feelings of femininity

**Factors to Consider**:
1. Partner factors (e.g., partner's sexual problems, health status)
2. Relationship factors (e.g., poor communication, discrepancies in desire for sex)
3. Individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image, history of abuse)
4. Psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety)
5. Stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement)
6. Cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to sexual activity, attitudes toward sexuality)
7. Medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment

###### Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder: Prevalence, Causes, and Impact on Relationships

**Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder**

**Prevalence**:
- Unknown prevalence of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder
- Approx. 15% of women in North America report recurrent pain during intercourse
- Difficulties with intercourse are a frequent referral to sexual dysfunction clinics and specialist clinicians

**Development and Course**:
- Unclear development and course of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder
- Women typically do not seek treatment until they experience problems in sexual functioning
- Earlier clinical signs may include difficulty with or avoidance of tampon use, and difficulties with vaginal penetration
- Once symptomatology is well established for approximately 6 months, the probability of spontaneous and significant symptomatic remission diminishes
- Complaints related to genito-pelvic pain peak during early adulthood and in the peri- and postmenopausal period

**Risk Factors**:
- **Environmental**: Sexual and/or physical abuse have been cited as predictors of sexual pain disorders
- **Genetic and physiological**: Women experiencing superficial pain during intercourse often report onset after vaginal infections, even without residual physical findings
- **Culture-related**: Controversial, with research not supporting the notion that religious orthodoxy or lack of sexual education are predisposing factors
- **Gender-related**: Diagnosis given only to women; research is limited on urological chronic pelvic pain in men

**Functional Consequences**:
- Functional difficulties in genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder often interfere with relationship satisfaction and the ability to conceive via penile/vaginal intercourse.

###### Differential Diagnoses for Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder

**Differential Diagnosis for Genito-pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder**

**Medical Conditions:**
- Women may be diagnosed with other medical conditions (e.g., lichen sclerosus, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, vulvovaginal atrophy)
  * Treating the condition may alleviate genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder in some cases
  * Relationship between medical condition and genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder not well understood
- Difficult to diagnose and treat, especially for postmenopausal women experiencing pain during intercourse

**Somatic Symptom Disorder:**
- Some women with genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder may be diagnosed with somatic symptom disorder
- Clear differentiation between the two conditions not yet established

**Comorbidities:**
- High prevalence of other sexual difficulties and relationship distress among those diagnosed with genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder
- Pelvic floor symptoms may indicate a higher likelihood of other disorders related to pelvic floor or reproductive organs (e.g., interstitial cystitis, constipation, vaginal infection, endometriosis)

**Ineffective Sexual Stimuli:**
- Inadequate foreplay or arousal may lead to difficulties with penetration, pain, or avoidance
- Erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation in male partner can result in problems with penetration
- Careful assessment of these conditions necessary.

#### Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder

**Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD)**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **Criterion A**: Persistently or recurrently deficient/absent sexual thoughts, fantasies, and desire for sexual activity.
  - Judgment of deficiency is based on age, general context, and socio-cultural factors.
  - Symptoms must have persisted for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months.
  - Causes clinically significant distress in the individual.
  - Not better explained by non-sexual mental disorder, relationship distress, or substance/medication use.
- **Criterion B**: Duration and severity of symptoms: mild, moderate, or severe.

**Assessment Considerations**:
- Assess for "desire discrepancy" between partners' levels of desire.
- Both low desire and deficient/absent sexual thoughts are required for diagnosis.
- Symptom duration and adaptive response to adverse life conditions must be considered.

**Associated Features**:
- Erectile and ejaculatory concerns may co-occur with HSDD.
- Lack of initiation or receptivity to partner's attempts is common.

**Subtypes**:
- Lifelong vs. acquired
- Generalized vs. situational

**Factors Influencing Diagnosis**:
1. **Partner factors**: partner sexual problems, health status
2. **Relationship factors**: poor communication, discrepancies in desire, relationship distress
3. **Individual vulnerability factors**: body image issues, history of abuse, psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety), stressors
4. **Cultural/religious factors**: inhibitions related to sexual activity, attitudes toward sexuality
5. **Medical factors**: relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment

###### Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Diagnosis of Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder

**Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder**

**Prevalence**:
- Approximately 6% of younger men (ages 18-24) and 41% of older men (ages 66-74) have problems with sexual desire
- Persistent lack of interest in sex, lasting 6 months or more, affects only 1.8% of men ages 16-44

**Classification**:
- **Lifetime subtype**: Low or no sexual desire has always been present
- **Acquired subtype**: Low desire developed after a period of normal sexual desire
- Requirement for persistence of low desire for approximately 6 months
- Normative age-related decline in sexual desire

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**:
- **Temperamental**: Mood and anxiety symptoms are strong predictors of low desire
- **Environmental**: Alcohol use may increase occurrence; self-directed homophobia, interpersonal problems, lack of adequate sex education, and trauma from early life experiences in gay men
- **Genetic and physiological**: Endocrine disorders like hyperprolactinemia affect desire; age is a significant risk factor; critical threshold for testosterone's effect on sexual desire
- **Culture-related diagnostic issues**: Prevalence rates vary across cultures, with higher rates among East Asian men
- **Gender-related diagnostic issues**: Differential diagnosis from women's classification of desire and arousal disorders

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Nonsexual mental disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder) may explain lack of desire
- Substance/medication use may contribute to low desire
- Other medical conditions or interpersonal factors better explaining low or absent desire and deficient/absent erotic thoughts
- Presence of other sexual dysfunctions does not rule out male hypoactive sexual desire disorder

**Comorbidity**:
- Depression, other mental disorders, and endocrinological factors often coexist with male hypoactive sexual desire disorder.

#### Premature (Early) Ejaculation

**Premature (Early) Ejaculation Diagnostic Criteria**

A. **Persistent/Recurrent Pattern of Ejaculation**:
- Occurs within approximately 1 minute after vaginal penetration and before the individual wishes it
- Applies to nonvaginal sexual activities, but duration criteria not established

B. **Symptom Duration**:
- Must have been present for at least 6 months
- Experienced on almost all (approximately 75%-100%) occasions of sexual activity
- Causes clinically significant distress in the individual

C. **Exclusions**:
- Not better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder or relationship distress/stressors
- Not attributable to substance/medication effects or other medical conditions

**Lifelong vs. Acquired**:
- Lifelong: Disturbance present since becoming sexually active
- Acquired: Disturbance began after normal sexual function

**Generalized vs. Situational**:
- Generalized: Not limited to specific stimulation, situations, or partners
- Situational: Occurs with certain types of stimulation, situations, or partners

**Severity Specifiers**:
- Mild: Ejaculation within approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute of vaginal penetration
- Moderate: Ejaculation within approximately 15-30 seconds of vaginal penetration
- Severe: Ejaculation prior to or at the start of sexual activity, or within approximately 15 seconds of vaginal penetration

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Manifested by ejaculation occurring before or shortly after vaginal penetration
- Estimated ejaculatory latency highly correlated with measured intravaginal ejaculatory latencies
- 60-second intravaginal ejaculatory latency time appropriate cutoff for lifelong premature (early) ejaculation in heterosexual men

**Associated Features**:
- Sense of lack of control over ejaculation
- Apprehension about inability to delay ejaculation on future sexual encounters
- Relevant factors: partner factors, relationship factors, individual vulnerability factors, psychiatric comorbidity, cultural/religious factors, medical factors.

###### Prevalence Variability in Premature Ejaculation Definitions

**Premature (Early) Ejaculation Prevalence**

**Prevalence Estimates**:
- More than 20%-30% of men ages 18-70 report concern about rapid ejaculation
- With new definition, only 1%-3% would be diagnosed with premature (early) ejaculation

**Definitions and Diagnosis**:
- International studies: more than 20%-30% of men affected
- New definition: **premature (early) ejaculation**: occurs within approximately 1 minute of vaginal penetration.
- With this new definition, only 1%-3% would be diagnosed with the disorder

###### "Premature Ejaculation: Prevalence, Causes, and Consequences"

**Prevalence of Premature (Early) Ejaculation**
- Prevalence may increase with age
- Lifelong vs Acquired:
  - **Lifelong**: begins early and persists throughout life
    - Stable throughout life, relatively stable diagnosis
  - **Acquired**: onset later, usually appearing during or after the fourth decade of life
    - Less known about course and reversibility
- Course:
  - Lifelong is relatively stable
  - Acquired may reverse with treatment of underlying conditions like hyperthyroidism or prostatitis

**Definition**
- Premature (early) ejaculation: persistent problem with ejaculatory control, leading to unsatisfactory sexual experiences for self and partner

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**
- **Temperamental**: anxiety disorders, especially social anxiety disorder (social phobia) may increase risk
- **Genetic**: moderate genetic contribution to lifelong premature ejaculation
  - Associated with dopamine transporter gene polymorphism or serotonin transporter gene polymorphism
- **Physiological**: thyroid disease, prostatitis associated with acquired premature ejaculation

**Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues**
- Perception of normal ejaculatory latency differs between cultures
  - Measured ejaculatory latencies may differ in some countries due to cultural or genetic factors

**Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues**
- Premature (early) ejaculation is a male sexual disorder
- Different perceptions of acceptable ejaculatory latency between males and their partners
  - Increasing concerns about early ejaculation in females reflecting societal attitudes on female sexual activity

**Diagnostic Markers**
- Ejaculatory latency measured using a timing device (stopwatch) during vaginal intercourse, not ideal for real-life situations

**Consequences of Premature (Early) Ejaculation**
- Decreased self-esteem and sense of lack of control in males
- Adverse consequences for partner relationships
- Personal distress for sexual partners
- Difficulties with conception if ejaculation occurs prior to penetration.

###### Diagnosing and Comorbidities of Premature Ejaculation

**Differential Diagnosis**
- **Substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction**: When problems with premature ejaculation are due exclusively to substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal, this diagnosis should be given.
- **Ejaculatory concerns that do not meet diagnostic criteria**:
  - Normal ejaculatory latencies who desire longer ones
  - Episodic premature (early) ejaculation (e.g., during the first sexual encounter with a new partner)
- These situations would not lead to a diagnosis of premature (early) ejaculation, even though they may be distressing to some males.

**Comorbidity**
- **Lifelong premature (early) ejaculation**: May be associated with certain anxiety disorders.
- **Acquired premature (early) ejaculation**: May be associated with prostatitis, thyroid disease, or drug withdrawal (e.g., during opioid withdrawal).

**Difficulty Determining Onset**:
- It may be difficult to determine which difficulty (erectile problems or premature ejaculation) preceded the other.

#### Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction

**Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction**

**Criteria:**
- Predominant disturbance in sexual function
- Symptoms developed during or soon after substance intoxication, withdrawal, or medication exposure
- Involved substance/medication capable of producing symptoms
- Disturbance not better explained by independent sexual dysfunction

**Diagnostic Features:**
1. **Clinically significant disturbance in sexual function**
2. Onset during:
   - Substance intoxication
   - Substance withdrawal
   - Medication use
3. Duration of symptoms after cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication
4. Existence of independent non-substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction (history, recurrent episodes)
5. No occurrence exclusively during delirium
6. Clinically significant distress in individual
7. Severity: Mild, Moderate, Severe
8. Recording Procedure: ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes based on substance class and presence of comorbid disorder (if any).

**Substances Associated with Sexual Dysfunctions:**
- Alcohol
- Opioids
- Sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics
- Stimulants (including cocaine)
- Other substances
- Medications: antidepressants, antipsychotics, hormonal contraceptives

**Recording Procedure:**
1. Substance/Medication name
2. Diagnostic code based on drug class and comorbid disorder (if any)
3. Onset specification
4. Severity specifier
5. Separate diagnostic code for substance use disorder (if applicable)
6. List substances playing significant role in development of sexual dysfunction separately.

###### Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction: Prevalence, Development, Diagnosis, and Treatment

**Prevalence of Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction:**
- Unclear due to underreporting
- Higher prevalence reported for antidepressants (25%--80%)
  * Serotonergic antidepressants: variable incidence, differences unclear
  * Tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors: 25% report sexual side effects
  * Combined serotonergic-adrenergic antidepressants: approximately 50% of individuals taking antipsychotic medications experience adverse sexual side effects. Incidence of specific agents unknown.
- Other nonpsychiatric medications: prevalence and incidence unknown, some evidence for methadone or high-dose opioids, illicit substances, chronic alcohol abuse, and nicotine use.

**Onset and Course:**
- Antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction onset: as early as 8 days after initiation
- Approximately 30% of mild to moderate cases may resolve within 6 months
- Time to onset for antipsychotic drugs or drugs of abuse unknown
- Adverse effects of nicotine and alcohol may not appear until after years of use. Premature ejaculation can sometimes occur after cessation of opioid use.

**Cultural Factors:**
- Interaction between cultural factors, medication impact on sexual functioning, and individual response

**Gender Differences:**
- Some gender differences in sexual side effects may exist

**Consequences:**
- Medication noncompliance due to sexual dysfunction
- Difficulty differentiating substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction from underlying mental disorders

**Diagnostic Categories:**
- Other specified sexual dysfunction (F52.8) for presentations that cause clinically significant distress but do not meet full criteria for specific sexual dysfunctions
- Unspecified sexual dysfunction (F52.9) when there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

### Gender Dysphoria

**Gender Dysphoria and Related Terms:**
- **Gender dysphoria**: diagnosis for individuals experiencing distress due to incongruence between experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender
- **Sex and sexual**: biological indicators of male and female (reproductive capacity)
- **Disorders of sex development**: conditions involving deviations from reproductive tract norms or discrepancies in biological sex indicators
- **Cross-sex hormone treatment**: use of feminizing hormones for individuals assigned male at birth, or masculinizing hormones for those assigned female
- **Gender**: public and legally recognized lived role as boy or girl, man or woman
- **Gender assignment**: initial assignment as male or female at birth, yielding "natal gender"
- **Gender-atypical/gender-nonconforming**: features or behaviors not typical of individuals with the same assigned gender
- **Gender reassignment**: official change of gender (legal)
- **Gender identity**: individual's identification as male, female, or other categories
- **Transgender**: broad spectrum of individuals who temporarily or persistently identify with a gender different from their natal gender
- **Transsexual**: individuals seeking social transition from one gender to another through hormonal and/or surgical intervention
- **Distress**: not all individuals experience distress due to incongruence between experienced/expressed and assigned genders; however, some are distressed if desired physical interventions are unavailable.

#### Gender Dysphoria

**Gender Dysphoria: Diagnostic Criteria**

**Infants, Children, and Adolescents (302.6 [F64.2])**
- **A. Marked incongruence between experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender** for at least 6 months:
  * Strong desire to be another gender or belief of being the other gender
  * Preference for cross-dressing, wearing opposite gender clothing, or rejecting typical attire
  * Cross-gender roles in play and fantasy
  * Preference for toys, games, or activities stereotypical of the opposite gender
  * Preference for playmates of the opposite gender
  * Rejection or avoidance of typical gender toys/activities
  * Dislike of primary and secondary sex characteristics that match assigned gender
  * Desire for primary and secondary sex characteristics of experienced gender
- **B. Clinically significant distress or impairment in social, school, or other important areas**
- **Coding note**: If associated with a disorder of sex development (e.g., congenital adrenogenital disorder or androgen insensitivity syndrome), also code the specific disorder.

**Adults (302.85 [F64.1])**
- **A. Marked incongruence between experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender** for at least 6 months:
  * Incongruence between experienced/expressed gender and primary or secondary sex characteristics
  * Strong desire to be rid of one's own primary and/or secondary sex characteristics due to incongruence with experienced/expressed gender
  * Strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the opposite gender
  * Strong desire to be another gender (or some alternative gender)
  * Wish to be treated as the other gender
  * Feeling that one has typical feelings and reactions of the other gender
- **B. Clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas**
- **Coding note**: If associated with a disorder of sex development (e.g., congenital adrenogenital disorder or androgen insensitivity syndrome), also code the specific disorder.

**Additional Specifiers**:
- Posttransition: The individual has transitioned to full-time living in the desired gender and undergone gender reassignment surgery or cross-sex hormone treatment. This specifier may be used if continuing treatment procedures support the new gender assignment.

###### Prevalence, Development, and Course in Adulthood and Childhood

**Gender Dysphoria Prevalence and Development**
- **Prevalence**: 0.005% to 0.014% for natal adult males, 0.002% to 0.003% for natal females. Possible underestimate due to unreported cases.
- **Sex differences in referrals**: Children: 2:1 to 4.5:1 sex ratio; Adolescents: parity; Adults: 1:1 to 6.1:1. Some countries have higher female ratios (Ukraine, Poland).
- **Criteria sets**: Different for children, adolescents, and adults based on age and expression of gender dysphoria.

**Children's Development and Course**
- **Onset**: Usually between ages 2 and 4 years.
- **Expressions**: Less extreme and persistent anatomic dysphoria than adolescents/adults; may not manifest in all social environments or with age.
- **Distress**: May only appear when parents mention opposite gender, or if desire is interfered with. May be mitigated by supportive environments.
- **Impairment**: Can lead to school refusal, depression, anxiety, substance abuse.
- **Persistence rates**: 2.2% to 30% for natal males; 12% to 50% for natal females. Modestly correlated with severity and socioeconomic background.
- **Desired gender**: Most are sexually attracted to their natal sex, but some may be androphilic or gynephilic.
- **Trajectories**: Early onset: continuous from childhood; Late onset: intermittent period of self-identifying as gay/homosexual followed by recurrence of gender dysphoria.
- **Sexuality after transition**: Late-onset males may be gynephilic, but some may be androphilic or lesbian. Females remain gynephilic after transition.

**Gender Dysphoria in Association with Disorder of Sex Development**
- **Association**: Most individuals do not progress to gender dysphoria despite gender-atypical behavior due to early medical intervention and awareness.
- **Uncertainty vs. firm conviction**: Those with a disorder of sex development may experience uncertainty about their gender instead of developing a firm conviction for gender transition.

###### Diagnostic Factors of Gender Dysphoria: Risk, Markers, and Functional Consequences

**Risk and Prognostic Factors for Gender Dysphoria**

**Temperamental**:
- For individuals without a disorder of sex development:
  - Atypical gender behavior in early preschool age increases the likelihood of gender dysphoria persisting into adolescence and adulthood.

**Environmental**:
- Males with gender dysphoria (childhood and adolescence) more commonly have older brothers than males without the condition.
- Other predisposing factors for late-onset gender dysphoria:
  - Habitual fetishistic transvestism developing into autogynephilia
  - Other social, psychological, or developmental problems

**Genetic and Physiological**:
- Genetic contribution suggested by:
  - Familiality of transsexualism among non-twin siblings
  - Increased concordance for transsexualism in monozygotic compared with dizygotic same-sex twins
  - Heritability of gender dysphoria
- No endogenous systemic abnormalities in sex hormone levels found in 46,XY individuals.
- Increased androgen levels (hirsute women range) found in 46,XX individuals.

**Disorder of Sex Development**:
- Evidence suggests a higher likelihood of later gender dysphoria if:
  - Prenatal production and utilization of androgens are grossly atypical relative to the assigned gender
  - Additional prolonged, highly gender-atypical postnatal androgen exposure with somatic virilization

**Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues**:
- Gender dysphoria reported in individuals from various cultures and countries.
- Equivalent of gender dysphoria reported in individuals living in cultures with institutionalized non-binary gender categories.

**Diagnostic Markers**:
- Somatic disorders of sex development correlate with final gender identity outcome based on prenatal androgen production and utilization.
- Detailed diagnostic interview is required for gender dysphoria evaluation, rather than relying solely on biological factors.

**Functional Consequences of Gender Dysphoria**:
- Preoccupation with cross-gender wishes can interfere with daily activities in older children, adolescents, and adults.
- Relationship difficulties, including sexual relationship problems, are common.
- High levels of stigmatization, discrimination, and victimization lead to negative self-concept, mental disorder comorbidity, school dropout, and economic marginalization.

###### Differentiating Gender Disorders: Diagnostic Considerations

**Differential Diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria vs. Other Conditions**

**Gender Dysphoria vs. Nonconformity to Gender Roles**:
- Strong desire to be another gender than the assigned one
- Extent and pervasiveness of gender-variant activities and interests
- Distinguished from simple nonconformity to stereotypical gender role behavior (e.g., "tomboyism" in girls, "girly-boy" behavior in boys, occasional cross-dressing)

**Transvestic Disorder**:
- Occurs in heterosexual or bisexual adolescent/adult males (rarely in females)
- Cross-dressing behavior generates sexual excitement and causes distress/impairment without questioning primary gender
- Can be accompanied by **gender dysphoria**
- Precursor to late-onset gender dysphoria in some gynephilic natal males

**Body Dysmorphic Disorder**:
- Individual focuses on altering/removing a specific body part, not because it represents a repudiated assigned gender
- When present with **gender dysphoria**, both diagnoses can be given
- Individuals wishing to have a healthy limb amputated (termed "body integrity identity disorder") usually do not change gender, but desire to live as an amputee/disabled person

**Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders**:
- Rare occurrence of delusions of belonging to another gender in absence of psychotic symptoms
- Delusion that one is of another gender not considered a delusion if no psychotic symptoms present
- **Gender dysphoria** and schizophrenia (or other psychotic disorders) can co-occur

**Other Clinical Presentations**:
- Some individuals with emasculinization desire and an alternative, nonmale/nonfemale gender identity may have a presentation that meets criteria for **gender dysphoria**
- Males seeking castration/penectomy for aesthetic reasons or to remove psychological effects of androgens without changing male identity do not meet the criteria for **gender dysphoria**

**Comorbidities**:
- Clinically referred children with gender dysphoria show elevated levels of emotional and behavioral problems (most commonly, anxiety, disruptive and impulse-control, depressive disorders)
- Prevalence of mental health problems differs among cultures, related to attitudes toward gender variance in children
- **Autism spectrum disorder** is more prevalent in clinically referred children with gender dysphoria than the general population
- Clinically referred adolescents with gender dysphoria appear to have comorbid mental disorders (most commonly anxiety and depressive disorders)
- **Clinically referred adults with gender dysphoria may have coexisting mental health problems, most commonly anxiety and depressive disorders**

#### Other Specified Gender Dysphoria

**Gender Dysphoria Diagnostic Categories:**
- **Specified Gender Dysphoria (F64.8):**
  * Includes presentations where symptoms of gender dysphoria cause clinically significant distress or impairment, but don't meet full criteria for GD.
  - Example: "other specified gender dysphoria – brief duration"
- **Unspecified Gender Dysphoria (F64.9):**
  * Includes presentations where symptoms of gender dysphoria cause clinically significant distress or impairment, but don't meet full criteria for GD and no specific reason is provided.
  - Example: "unspecified gender dysphoria – insufficient information"

### Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders

**Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders**

**Description:**
- Conditions involving self-control issues resulting in behaviors that violate others' rights or societal norms

**Diagnostic Categories (DSM-5):**
1. **Oppositional Defiant Disorder**
2. **Intermittent Explosive Disorder**
3. **Conduct Disorder**
4. **Antisocial Personality Disorder** (Personality Disorders chapter)
5. **Pyromania**
6. **Kleptomania**
7. **Other Specified and Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders**

**Common Characteristics:**
- Problems with emotional and behavioral regulation
- Violation of others' rights or societal norms

**Causes:**
- Vary greatly across disorders and individuals

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- Different levels of emphasis on problems in emotions (e.g., anger) or behaviors (e.g., aggression)

**Demographics:**
- More common in males than females, although male predominance may differ among disorders
- First onset often in childhood or adolescence; rare for first emergence in adulthood

**Relationships:**
- Developmental relationship between Oppositional Defiant Disorder and Conduct Disorder
- Children with Oppositional Defiant Disorder at risk for other problems like anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and antisocial personality disorder

**Assessment:**
- Critical to consider frequency, persistence, pervasiveness, and impairment relative to age, gender, and culture when determining symptomatology.

**Shared Personality Dimensions:**
- Externalizing spectrum associated with disinhibition and constraint (to a lesser extent negative emotionality) may explain comorbidity among these disorders and their frequent comorbidity with substance use disorders and antisocial personality disorder.

#### Oppositional Defiant Disorder

**Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)**

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- **Persistent pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness**: lasting at least 6 months with at least four symptoms from any of the following categories:
  - Angry/Irritable Mood:
    - Often loses temper
    - Is often touchy or easily annoyed
    - Is often angry and resentful
  - Argumentative/Defiant Behavior:
    - Often argues with authority figures (for children and adolescents, with adults)
    - Often actively defies or refuses to comply with requests from authority figures or rules
    - Often deliberately annoys others
    - Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior
  - Vindictiveness: Has been spiteful or vindictive at least twice within the past 6 months
- **Associated with distress in individual or others**
- **Impacts negatively on social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning**
- **Does not occur exclusively during psychosis, substance use, depression, bipolar disorder, or disruptive mood dysregulation disorder**

**Diagnostic Features:**
- **Frequent and persistent pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness (Criterion A)**
  - May exhibit symptoms only in one setting, most frequently at home
  - Symptoms contribute to significant impairment in social functioning
  - Pervasiveness of symptoms indicates disorder severity
- **Assessment across multiple settings and relationships**
- **Difficulty determining causal factors due to problematic interactions with others (e.g., hostile parenting, neglectful child-rearing practices)**

**Comorbidities:**
- **Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)**
- **Increased risk for suicide attempts**

###### Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Manifestations of Oppositional Defiant Disorder in Children and Adolescents

**Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)**

**Prevalence:**
- Ranges from 1% to 11%, average estimate: 3.3%
- More prevalent in males than females (1.4:1) before adolescence

**Development and Course:**
- Symptoms first appear during preschool years, by early adolescence
- Often precedes Conduct Disorder, especially childhood-onset type
- Manifestations consistent across development
- Increased risk for anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder
- Behaviors may increase in frequency and intensity during preschool period and adolescence

**Risk Factors:**
- Temperamental issues: high emotional reactivity, poor frustration tolerance
- Environmental factors: harsh, inconsistent or neglectful child-rearing practices
- Genetic and physiological markers: lower heart rate, skin conductance reactivity, reduced basal cortisol reactivity, abnormalities in prefrontal cortex and amygdala (most studies do not distinguish ODD from Conduct Disorder)

**Culture:**
- Prevalence consistent across different races and ethnicities

**Functional Consequences:**
- Persistent disorder leads to frequent conflicts with various individuals
- Impairments in emotional, social, academic, and occupational adjustment.

###### Differential Diagnosis: Oppositional Defiant Disorder

**Differential Diagnosis for Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)**

**Conduct Disorder vs. ODD:**
- Both related to conduct problems with authority figures
- Behaviors of ODD are typically less severe than conduct disorder
  - No aggravation toward people or animals, destruction of property, or theft/deceit
- ODD includes emotional dysregulation (angry and irritable mood) not included in conduct disorder

**ADHD vs. ODD:**
- ADHD often comorbid with ODD
- Failure to conform to others' requests isn't the sole situation demanding sustained effort, attention, or stillness for a diagnosis of ODD

**Depressive and Bipolar Disorders vs. ODD:**
- Depressive and bipolar disorders involve negative affect and irritability
- Diagnosis of ODD should not be given if symptoms occur exclusively during mood disorder

**Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) vs. ODD:**
- Both share chronic negative mood, temper outbursts
- Severity, frequency, and chronicity of temper outbursts more severe in individuals with DMDD
- Only a minority of children/adolescents meeting ODD criteria have DMDD
- When symptoms meet criteria for DMDD, no diagnosis of ODD is given

**Intermittent Explosive Disorder vs. ODD:**
- Both involve anger and irritability
- Individuals with intermittent explosive disorder show serious aggression toward others not part of ODD definition

**Intellectual Disability/Developmental Disorder vs. ODD:**
- Give diagnosis only if behavior is markedly greater than typically observed for individuals of comparable mental age and severity of intellectual disability

**Language Disorders vs. ODD:**
- Distinguish from failure to follow directions due to impaired language comprehension (e.g., hearing loss)

**Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) vs. ODD:**
- Opposition and defiance may be due to fear of negative evaluation in social anxiety disorder

**Comorbidities of ODD:**
- Higher rates of comorbidity with ADHD, especially shared temperamental risks
- Often precedes conduct disorder, most common in children with childhood onset subtype
- Increased risk for anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder
- Adolescents and adults show higher substance use disorders rate but independence of conduct disorder comorbidity.

#### Intermittent Explosive Disorder

**Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED)**

**Diagnostic Criteria (F63.81)**:
- **Recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control aggressive impulses**, as manifested by:
  - Verbal aggression (temper tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments or fights) or physical aggression toward property, animals, or other individuals, occurring twice weekly, on average, for a period of 3 months. Physical aggression does not result in damage/destruction of property and doesn't cause physical injury to animals or individuals.
  - Three behavioral outbursts involving damage or destruction of property and/or physical assault (resulting in injury) occurring within a 12-month period.
- **Magnitude of aggressiveness expressed** during recurrent outbursts is grossly out of proportion to provocation or psychosocial stressors.
- Recurrent aggressive outbursts are **not premeditated**, impulsive and/or anger-based, and not committed to achieve tangible objectives (e.g., money, power, intimidation).
- Recurrent aggressive outbursts cause marked distress in the individual or impair occupational or interpersonal functioning, or are associated with financial/legal consequences.
- **Chronological age is at least 6 years** (or equivalent developmental level).
- Recurrent aggressive outbursts are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, psychotic disorder, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder) and are not attributable to another medical condition or substance use.
- For children ages 6--18 years, aggressive behavior as part of an **adjustment disorder** should not be considered for this diagnosis.

**Associated Features**:
- Mood disorders (unipolar), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders are associated with intermittent explosive disorder, although onset is typically later than IED.

###### Intermittent Explosive Disorder: Diagnosis and Comorbidities

**Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED)**

**Prevalence**:
- One-year prevalence in the US is about 2.7% (narrow definition)
- More common among younger individuals (e.g., <35-40 years old) than older individuals (e.g., >50 years old)
- Higher prevalence in individuals with a high school education or less

**Development and Course**:
- Onset of recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive behavior is most common in late childhood or adolescence and rarely begins after age 40
- Core features are persistent and continue for many years
- Course may be episodic with recurrent outbursts
- Appears to follow a chronic and persistent course over many years
- Common regardless of presence/absence of ADHD or disruptive disorders

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**:
- **Environmental**: History of physical/emotional trauma in the first two decades of life increases risk
- **Genetic and Physiological**: First-degree relatives of IED patients are at increased risk; substantial genetic influence on impulsive aggression
- Serotonergic abnormalities and amygdala responses to anger stimuli observed in individuals with IED

**Cultural Considerations**:
- Lower prevalence in some regions (Asia, Middle East) or countries (Romania, Nigeria) due to cultural factors

**Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues**:
- Greater prevalence in males than females (odds ratio= 1.4-2.3), but no gender difference in other studies

**Functional Consequences of IED**:
- Social: loss of friends, relatives, marital instability
- Occupational: demotion, loss of employment
- Financial: due to destroyed objects
- Legal: civil suits, criminal charges

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Not diagnosed when Criteria A1 and/or A2 only met during another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder)
- Not attributed to other medical conditions or substances/medications
- Not diagnosed in children/adolescents unless accompanied by disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD)
- Differentiated from:
  - **Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD)**: Persistently negative mood state, onset before age 10
  - **Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD)** or **borderline personality disorder (BPD)**: Lower level of impulsive aggression compared to IED
  - **Delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, and personality change due to another medical condition, aggressive type**: Aggressive outbursts result from other diagnosable conditions
  - **Substance intoxication or withdrawal**: Impulsive aggressive outbursts nearly always associated with substance use
  - **Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or autism spectrum disorder**: Lower level of impulsive aggression compared to IED
- If Criteria A-E are met and the impulsive aggressive outbursts warrant clinical attention, a diagnosis of IED may be given.

**Comorbidities**:
- Depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders most commonly comorbid with IED
- Individuals with antisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder, and those with histories of disruptive behaviors (e.g., ADHD, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder) are at greater risk for comorbid IED.

- Estimates range from 2% to over 10%, with a median of 4%
- Consistent across various countries and ethnicities
- Higher in males than females
- More prevalent in childhood than adolescence
- Few children with impairing conduct disorder receive treatment

**Development and Course**
- Onset may occur as early as preschool or middle childhood
- Oppositional defiant disorder is a common precursor to childhooed-onset type
- Symptoms emerge in adolescence, rare after age 16 years
- Variable course with some individuals achieving adequate adjustment
- Early-onset predicts worse prognosis and increased risk for criminal behavior
- Comorbidities: mood disorders, anxiety disorders, PTSD, impulse control disorders, psychotic disorders, somatic symptom disorders, substance-related disorders

**Risk Factors (Environmental)**
- Parental rejection and neglect
- Inconsistent child-rearing practices
- Harsh discipline or physical/sexual abuse
- Lack of supervision
- Early institutional living
- Frequent caregiver changes
- Large family size
- Parental criminality or psychopathology (substance use disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia)
- Peer rejection and delinquent peer group
- Neighborhood exposure to violence

**Risk Factors (Genetic and Physiological)**
- Increased risk with biological or adoptive parent or sibling with conduct disorder
- Higher risk for children of parents with severe alcohol use disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, ADHD, or conduct disorder
- Slower resting heart rate compared to those without the disorder
- Reduced autonomic fear conditioning (low skin conductance)
- Structural and functional differences in brain areas associated with affect regulation and processing

**Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues**
- Misapplication of diagnosis in certain settings where disruptive behavior is near normative

**Gender Differences**
- Males: fighting, stealing, vandalism, school discipline problems
- Females: lying, truancy, running away, substance use, prostitution

**Functional Consequences of Conduct Disorder**
- School suspension or expulsion
- Problems in work adjustment
- Legal difficulties
- Sexually transmitted diseases and unplanned pregnancies
- Physical injury from accidents or fights
- Early onset of sexual behavior, alcohol use, tobacco smoking, illegal substance use, reckless and risk-taking acts.

###### Differential Diagnosis of Conduct Disorders

**Differential Diagnosis of Oppositional Defiant Disorder**
- **Oppositional defiant disorder vs conduct disorder:**
  - Behaviors in conflict with adults/authority figures
  - Less severe than conduct disorder
    - No aggression toward individuals or animals
    - No destruction of property
    - No pattern of theft or deceit
  - Includes emotional dysregulation (angry and irritable mood)
- When both disorders are present, give separate diagnoses
- **Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder:**
  - Hyperactive and impulsive behavior does not meet conduct disorder criteria
  - If criteria for both ADHD and conduct disorder, give both diagnoses
- **Depressive and bipolar disorders**
  - Irritability, aggression, conduct problems can occur
  - Behavioral problems distinguishable based on course
    - Substantial levels of aggressive or non-aggressive conduct problems during periods without mood disturbance
  - Criteria for both diagnoses can be given
- **Intermittent explosive disorder:**
  - High rates of aggression but impulsive and not premeditated
  - Aggression not committed to achieve tangible objective or cause impairment
  - If criteria met, give diagnosis only when recurrent impulsive aggressive outbursts warrant independent clinical attention
- **Adjustment disorders:**
  - Clinically significant conduct problems developing with psychosocial stressor
  - Resolve within six months of termination of stressor or its consequences
  - Diagnose conduct disorder for repetitive and persistent pattern associated with impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning
- **Comorbidity:** ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder common in individuals with conduct disorder; predicts worse outcomes.
- Individuals with antisocial personality disorder may exhibit behaviors meeting conduct disorder criteria but also basic rights violation and major age-appropriate societal norms.
- Conduct disorder can co-occur with specific learning disorders, anxiety disorders, depressive or bipolar disorders, substance-related disorders.
- **Academic achievement:** Often below expected level based on age and intelligence, may justify additional diagnosis of specific learning disorder or communication disorder.

- Substance intoxication
- Withdrawal
- Other substance/medication-induced mental disorders (e.g., psychotic disorders, bipolar and related disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, sleep disorders, sexual dysfunctions, delirium, neurocognitive disorders)

**General Discussion**:
- Substances activate brain reward system, which is involved in reinforcement of behaviors and production of memories
- Intense activation of reward pathways can lead to neglecting normal activities
- Individuals with lower self-control may be predisposed to develop substance use disorders
- Gambling disorder included as it activates similar reward systems as drugs of abuse
- Behavioral addictions (e.g., "sex addiction," "exercise addiction," "shopping addiction") not recognized as mental disorders due to insufficient evidence

**Organization**:
- Substance use disorders vs. substance-induced mental disorders
- Unique aspects of each substance class discussed in subsequent sections

**Table 1**: Diagnoses associated with substance classes

#### Substance-Induced Disorders

**Substance Intoxication and Withdrawal Criteria**

**Substance Intoxication:**
- Essential feature: Development of a reversible substance-specific syndrome due to recent ingestion (Criterion A)
- Behavioral or psychological changes attributable to the physiological effects on the CNS (Criterion B)
- Symptoms not attributable to another medical condition or mental disorder (Criterion D)
- Common among those with a substance use disorder, but can occur without one
- Includes disturbances of perception, wakefulness, attention, thinking, judgment, psychomotor behavior, interpersonal behavior
- Short-term vs. chronic intoxications may have different signs and symptoms
- Distinguish from physiological or psychological changes not necessarily problematic
- Intoxication can persist beyond detection of substance in the body

**Substance Withdrawal:**
- Development of a substance-specific problematic behavioral change with physiological and cognitive concomitants (Criterion A)
- Causes clinically significant distress or impairment (Criterion C)
- Not due to another medical condition or mental disorder (Criterion D)
- Usually associated with a substance use disorder, but can occur without one
- Characterized by symptoms initiated by a decline in blood or tissue concentrations of the substance

**Laboratory Findings:**
- Help determine recent use and specific substances involved
- Positive test does not indicate a substance-induced or substance use disorder
- Negative test does not rule out diagnosis
- Useful for identifying withdrawal from an unknown substance
- Normal functioning in the presence of high blood levels suggests tolerance

**Coding Procedures:**
- Record code that applies to the class of substances, indicating specific substance if known
- ICD-10-CM codes imply a comorbid moderate to severe substance use disorder for that substance
- Use "other substance intoxication" or "unknown substance intoxication" for unknown or unclassified substances
- Separate diagnostic codes used in ICD-9-CM compared to ICD-10-CM
- Additional coding information provided in individual substance-specific sections.

1. **Substance-induced disorders**: develop in the context of intoxication or withdrawal from substances of abuse
2. **Medication-induced disorders**: seen with prescribed or over-the-counter medications taken at suggested doses
3. **Long-duration substance-induced disorders**: substance-associated neurocognitive disorders, hallucinogen persisting perception disorder
4. **General features of Substance/Medication-Induced Mental Disorders:**
   - Usually temporary and improve within a month after cessation
   - Individuals more prone toward specific substance-induced disorders based on predispositions or personal history
   - Symptoms may intensify in the context of preexisting mental disorders
5. **Importance of Recognizing Substance/Medication-Induced Mental Disorders:**
   - Similar symptom profiles as independent mental disorders but different treatments and prognoses
   - Important for differential diagnoses before diagnosing an independent psychiatric condition.

###### Functional Consequences of Substance/Medication­ Induced Mental Disorders

**Functional Consequences of Substance/Medication-Induced Mental Disorders**

**Related Independent Mental Disorder Consequences**:
- Same consequences apply to substance/medication-induced mental disorders

**Alcohol Use Disorder**

**Prevalence**:
- 4.6% 12-month prevalence among 12-17 year olds in the US
- 8.5% 12-month prevalence among adults age 18+ in the US
- Higher rates among adult men (12.4%) compared to women (4.9%)
- Decreases with age, greatest among 18-29 year olds (16.2%) and lowest in those 65+ (1.5%)
- Varied across racial/ethnic subgroups: Hispanics (6.0%), Native Americans/Alaska Natives (5.7%), Whites (5.0%), African Americans (1.8%), Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders (1.6%)

**Development and Course**:

- Most individuals develop disorder by late 30s
- Erroneously perceived as intractable, but prognosis varies
- Earlier onset in adolescents with conduct problems or earlier intoxication
- Variable course with periods of remission and relapse
- Older adults more susceptible to severe alcohol problems due to age-related changes

**Risk Factors**:
- **Environmental**: Cultural attitudes, availability, personal experiences, stress levels
- **Genetic/Physiological**: Family history (40%-60% of variance), high impulsivity, preexisting conditions like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder
- Other risk factors: Heavy peer substance use, exaggerated expectations, inadequate coping skills

**Course Modifiers**:
- High levels of impulsivity associated with earlier onset and severity

###### Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

**Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues: Alcohol Use Disorder**

**Prevalence of Alcohol Use Disorder**:
- Estimated 3.6% of the world population (15-64 years old) has a current (12-month) alcohol use disorder
- Prevalence varies by region:
  - Lowest in African region (1.1%)
  - Highest in Eastern Europe region (10.9%)
  - Intermediate in American and North/Central/South America and the Caribbean (5.2%)

**Laboratory Tests for Heavy Drinking**:
- **Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT)**: Elevated levels may indicate heavy drinking, especially when combined with other tests
- **Carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (COT)**: Levels above 20 units suggest regular consumption of 8 or more drinks daily
- Other potential markers include:
  - **Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)**: Elevated in heavy drinkers, but poor for monitoring abstinence due to red blood cell half-life
  - **Liver function tests (e.g., ALT and alkaline phosphatase)**: Reveal liver injury from heavy drinking
  - **Elevations in blood lipids (triglycerides, HDL cholesterol) and uric acid**

**Physical Signs of Heavy Drinking**:
- **Dyspepsia**, nausea, bloating: Accompany gastritis from heavy drinking
- **Hepatomegaly**, esophageal varices, hemorrhoids: Reflect liver changes
- **Tremor**, unsteady gait, insomnia, erectile dysfunction: Feminizing effects in males
- **Menstrual irregularities**, spontaneous abortion, fetal alcohol syndrome: In females and during pregnancy

**Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms**:

- Elevated risk for accidents, violence, suicide
- One in five intensive care unit admissions related to alcohol in some urban hospitals
- Contributes to criminal acts, including homicide, and increased risk of cancers

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- **Nonpathologic use of alcohol**: Heavy use without significant distress or impaired functioning
- **Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder**: Similar signs/symptoms, but course may be different
- **Conduct disorder in childhood and adult antisocial personality disorder**
- **Comorbidity with bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders**
- **Immune system suppression and increased risk for infections/cancers**

##### Alcohol Intoxication

**Diagnostic Criteria for Alcohol Intoxication**
- **A. Recent ingestion of alcohol:** Evidence of recent alcohol consumption can be obtained through breath, blood, or urine samples, as well as observing the individual's behavior and smelling alcohol on their breath.
- **B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes:** Problematic behaviors may include inappropriate sexual or aggressive behavior, mood lability, impaired judgment, and impaired social or occupational functioning that develop during or shortly after alcohol ingestion.
- **C. Signs or symptoms of intoxication:** These may include slurred speech, incoordination, unsteady gait, nystagmus, impairment in attention or memory, stupor, and coma. These symptoms are not attributable to other medical conditions or other mental disorders, including intoxication with other substances.
- **D. Differential diagnosis:** Ensure that the symptoms cannot be attributed to another medical condition, are not a reflection of conditions such as delirium, and are not related to intoxication with other depressant drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines).

**Diagnostic Features and Associated Features**
- **Alcohol intoxication may be associated with amnesia for events during the intoxication ("blackouts").**
- **Early symptoms of mild intoxication:** Talkativeness, sensation of well-being, and a bright, expansive mood. These symptoms occur when blood alcohol levels are rising.
- **Later symptoms of intoxication:** Progressive depression, withdrawal, cognitive impairment, sleep, anesthesia, inhibition of respiration and pulse, and even death in non-tolerant individuals. These symptoms typically occur as blood alcohol levels fall or when they are very high (e.g., 200-300 mg/dL for inhibition of respiration and pulse, and over 300-400 mg/dL for death).
- **Duration of intoxication:** The duration depends on the amount and timing of alcohol consumption; the body metabolizes approximately one standard drink per hour.
- **Contribution to suicidal behavior:** Alcohol intoxication is a significant contributor to suicidal behavior, including increased rates of suicidal thoughts and completed suicide.

###### Alcohol Intoxication: Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Complications

**Alcohol Intoxication Prevalence:**
- Majority of alcohol consumers have been intoxicated at some point in their lives
- In the US:
  - 44% of 12th-grade students admitted to drunkenness in past year
  - Over 70% of college students reported same
- Average age at first intoxication ~15 years, highest prevalence ~18-25 years
- Earlier onset = greater likelihood of alcohol use disorder development

**Risk and Prognostic Factors:**

**Temperamental**:
- Personality traits: sensation seeking, impulsivity increase intoxication risk

**Environmental**:
- Heavy drinking environments contribute to intoxication
- Cultural differences impact acceptance of intoxication (e.g., fraternities/sororities)

**Gender-Related**:
- Historically more accepted for males but less prominent in recent years, especially during adolescence and young adulthood

**Diagnostic Markers:**
- Observable behavior, alcohol on breath
- Increased intoxication with blood/breath alcohol levels and other substances
- Differential diagnosis: medical conditions (diabetic acidosis), neurological disorders (cerebellar ataxia), sedative-hypnotic or anxiolytic drugs, anticholinergics, antihistamines

**Functional Consequences:**
- Over 30,000 alcohol-related deaths in the US per year
- Costs associated with drunk driving, lost time from school or work, interpersonal arguments, physical fights

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Other medical conditions (diabetic acidosis) and neurological disorders can mimic alcohol intoxication
- Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drugs/substances may be mistaken for alcohol intoxication
  - Differentiated by observing alcohol on breath, measuring blood or breath alcohol levels, medical workup, history

**Comorbidity**:
- Intoxication can occur comorbidly with other substance intoxications (especially in individuals with conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder)

##### Alcohol Withdrawal

**Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **Criteria A & B**:
  - Cessation or reduction of heavy and prolonged alcohol use
  - Development of withdrawal symptoms within hours to days after cessation/reduction
  - Symptoms include:
    - Autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., sweating, pulse >100 bpm)
    - Increased hand tremor
    - Insomnia
    - Nausea or vomiting
    - Transient visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusions
    - Psychomotor agitation
    - Anxiety
    - Generalized tonic-clonic seizures
  - Symptoms cause clinically significant distress/impairment in functioning
- **Criterion C**: Symptoms not attributable to another medical condition or mental disorder (e.g., intoxication, withdrawal from other substances)

**Specifiers**:
- With perceptual disturbances: Rare instance of hallucinations without impaired reality testing; use "substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder" diagnosis

**Coding**:
- ICD-9-CM code: 291.81 (without perceptual disturbances) or 305.40 (with perceptual disturbances)
- ICD-10-CM code: F10.232 (alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbances)

**Associated Features**:
- Alcohol withdrawal delirium (rare, see "Delirium" in chapter "Neurocognitive Disorders")
- Prevalence: 50% of middle-class individuals with alcohol use disorder have experienced full withdrawal syndrome; higher rates among hospitalized/homeless individuals

**Development and Course**:
- Acute withdrawal typically lasts 4-5 days after extended heavy drinking
- Rare in individuals under 30; risk and severity increase with age
- Risk factors: Quantity, frequency of alcohol consumption; concurrent medical conditions; family history; prior withdrawals; drug use

**Functional Consequences**:
- Withdrawal symptoms can perpetuate drinking behaviors and contribute to relapse
- Symptoms requiring medically supervised detoxification lead to hospitalization and loss of productivity

##### Other Alcohol-Induced Disorders

**Alcohol-Induced Disorders**

**Criteria:**
- Symptoms resemble independent mental disorders
- Temporary condition after severe intoxication or withdrawal
- Improve within days to weeks of cessation

- Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
- Not attributable to another medical condition or better explained by another mental disorder or intoxication with another substance

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Caffeine can be consumed from various sources: coffee, tea, soda, energy drinks, over-the-counter products, and chocolate
- Regular caffeine use is common
- Evidence for clinical significance and prevalence of caffeine intoxication
- Symptoms may include sensory disturbances, heart rate changes, headaches, and physical examination findings
- Caffeine blood levels can aid diagnosis but are not diagnostic by themselves

**Prevalence:**
- Prevalence of caffeine intoxication in general population unclear (approx. 7% in the US)
- Symptoms usually remit within a day with no known long-term consequences, but high doses can be fatal
- Individuals with low body weight, lack of tolerance, or lack of knowledge about caffeine may be at increased risk

**Risk and Prognostic Factors:**
- Environmental: infrequent use or substantial increase in caffeine intake, oral contraceptives
- Genetic and physiological: genetic factors affecting risk, functional consequences: impaired functioning, dysfunction at work/school, social indiscretions, failure to fulfill role obligations.

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Other mental disorders with similar symptoms: panic attacks, anxiety disorders, manic episodes, sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal, sleep disorders, medication-induced side effects (e.g., akathisia)
- Caffeine intoxication vs. caffeine-induced disorders: onset during intoxication for anxiety disorder and sleep disorder; symptoms in excess of those usually associated with caffeine intoxication and severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention.

**Comorbidity:**
- Heavy use (>400 mg) can cause anxiety symptoms, somatic symptoms, gastrointestinal distress, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, eating disorders, psychotic disorders, sleep disorders, substance-related disorders.

##### Caffeine Withdrawal

**Caffeine Withdrawal**

**Criteria for Diagnosis**:
- Prolonged daily use of caffeine (Criterion A)
- Abrupt cessation or reduction in caffeine use, followed within 24 hours by three or more of the following symptoms:
  - Headache
  - Marked fatigue or drowsiness
  - Dysphoric mood, depressed mood, or irritability
  - Difficulty concentrating
  - Flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or muscle pain/stiffness) (Criterion B)
- The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C)
- The symptoms are not associated with the physiological effects of another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion D)

**Symptoms of Caffeine Withdrawal**:
- Headache: diffuse, gradual, throbbing, severe, sensitive to movement
- Other symptoms: fatigue or drowsiness, dysphoric mood, depressed mood, irritability, difficulty concentrating, flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, muscle pain/stiffness)
- Symptoms may occur without headache

**Prevalence of Caffeine Withdrawal**:
- More than 85% of adults and children in the United States regularly consume caffeine
- Adults ingest about 280 mg/day on average
- Prevalence of caffeine withdrawal in the general population is unclear, but around 50% may experience headaches after abstinence
- Among those attempting to permanently stop caffeine use, more than 70% may experience at least one symptom and 24% may experience multiple symptoms with functional impairment
- Among those abstaining without trying to stop, around 11% may experience headache and other symptoms with functional impairment

**Risk Factors for Caffeine Withdrawal**:
- Heavy caffeine use in individuals with mental disorders (eating disorders, smoking, prisoners, drug/alcohol abusers)
- Unavailability of caffeine as an environmental risk factor
- Genetic factors may increase vulnerability, but specific genes have not been identified
- Course modifiers: symptoms remit rapidly after re-exposure to caffeine, and low doses can prevent or attenuate symptoms

**Functional Consequences of Caffeine Withdrawal**:
- Symptoms can vary from mild to extreme, with functional impairment ranging from 10% to 55% (median 13%)
- Examples of functional impairment: unable to work/exercise/care for children; missing religious services; ending a vacation early; canceling social gatherings
- Caffeine withdrawal headaches may be the "worst ever experienced"

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Can mimic migraine, other headache disorders, viral illnesses, sinus conditions, tension, drug withdrawal states (e.g., from amphetamines, cocaine), and medication side effects
- Diagnosis rests on pattern and amount consumed, time interval between abstinence and symptoms, and clinical features
- Challenge dose of caffeine followed by symptom remission can confirm diagnosis

**Comorbidities**:
- Caffeine withdrawal may be associated with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, antisocial personality disorder in adults, moderate to severe alcohol use disorder, and cannabis/cocaine use

**Other Caffeine-Induced Disorders**:
- **Caffeine-induced anxiety disorder**: described in "Anxiety Disorders" chapter
- **Caffeine-induced sleep disorder**: described in "Sleep-Wake Disorders" chapter
- These caffeine-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of caffeine intoxication or withdrawal only when symptoms are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention

**Unspecified Caffeine-Related Disorder**:
- Category for presentations where symptoms characteristic of a caffeine-related disorder predominate but do not meet criteria for any specific disorder or substance/medication-induced mental disorders.

#### Cannabis- Related Disorders

**Cannabis-Related Disorders**

**Cannabis Use Disorder**
- Diagnostic Criteria: At least two of the following symptoms within a year, occurring simultaneously:

##### Cannabis Use Disorder
**Cannabis Use Disorder Diagnostic Features:**
- Associated with substances derived from cannabis plant or synthetic compounds
- Cannabis is commonly smoked via various methods: pipes, bongs, joints, blunts, vaporized
- Pharmacological and behavioral tolerance may develop after prolonged use
- Withdrawal symptoms occur upon cessation of daily/near-daily use, including irritability, anger, anxiety, restlessness, sleep difficulty, decreased appetite/weight loss.
- Cannabis use can interfere with work or school performance and increase physical risks.
- Individuals may continue using despite physical problems or exacerbation of mental health issues.

**Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis:**
- Use to cope with mood, sleep, pain, or other physiological/psychological problems
- Minimization of symptoms and excessive use despite negative consequences
- Importance of assessing extent of use and continued use despite risks to valued activities or relationships.

###### Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Development

**Prevalence of Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD)**
- **Cannabis is the most widely used illicit psychoactive substance in the US**
- 12-month prevalence of CUD among:
  - 12-17 year olds: 3.4%
  - Adults 18+: 1.5%
- Higher rates among males (2.2%) than females (0.8%)
- Highest rates in 18-29 year olds (4.4%), lowest in those 65+ (0.01%)
- **Ethnic and racial differences are moderate**
- Prevalence rates vary across racial/ethnic subgroups: Native Americans and Alaskan Natives have the highest rates (7.1%) compared to Hispanics (4.1%), Whites (3.4%), African Americans (2.7%), and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (0.9%)
- **Prevalence of CUD has been increasing among adults and adolescents in the past decade**

**Gender Differences**
- Generally concordant with other substance use disorders: more common in males, less so in adolescents
- Onset of CUD can occur at any time during or following adolescence, most commonly during adolescence or young adulthood

**Development and Course**
- **Patterns of excessive use with peers is common**, often a component of other delinquent behaviors in adolescents
- Milder cases: continued use despite disapproval from others, physical/behavioral consequences
- More severe cases: using alone or throughout the day, interferes with daily functioning
- Changes in mood stability, energy level, and eating patterns often observed
- **School-related problems common among adolescents with CUD**
- In adults, well-established patterns of daily use that continue despite clear psychosocial or medical problems
- **Early onset of CUD is a robust predictor of other substance use disorders and mental health disorders**

**Risk Factors**
- Temperamental: history of conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder
- Environmental: academic failure, tobacco smoking, unstable/abusive family situation, use of cannabis among immediate family members, a family history of substance use disorder, low socioeconomic status
- Genetic and physiological: heritable factors contribute 30-80% to variance in risk of CUD

###### Culture-Related Diagnostic

**Cannabis Use Disorder: Diagnostic Considerations**

**Prevalence**:
- Occurrence of cannabis use disorder is unknown across countries
- Prevalence rates are likely similar among developed countries
- Commonly the first drug of experimentation (often in teens) for various cultural groups in the U.S.

**Cultural Factors Affecting Diagnosis**:
- Acceptance of cannabis for medical purposes varies widely across and within cultures
- Cultural factors may impact detection of use, such as:
  - Arrests
  - School suspensions
  - Employment suspensions
- General change in substance use disorder diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV to DSM-5 (removal of recurrent substance-related legal problems) mitigates this concern

**Biological Testing**:
- Useful for determining recent cannabis use
- Particularly helpful when an individual denies using while others report concerns
- Cannabinoids are fat soluble and persist in bodily fluids for extended periods, requiring expertise to interpret results

**Functional Consequences of Cannabis Use Disorder**:
- Compromised psychosocial, cognitive, and health functioning
  - Cognitive function (higher executive function) is compromised
  - Reduction in prosocial goal-directed activity
  - Poor school performance and employment problems
  - Problems with social relationships
  - Increased risk for respiratory illnesses like tobacco smokers
  - Contribution to onset or exacerbation of mental disorders, especially schizophrenia

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Non-problematic cannabis use vs. cannabis use disorder: difficult to distinguish
- Cannabis-induced disorder vs. primary mental disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression)
- Comorbidity with other substance use disorders and mental conditions

**Comorbidities**:
- High lifetime probability of using more dangerous substances for individuals who frequently use cannabis
- Co-occurring mental conditions: poorer life satisfaction, increased treatment and hospitalization, depression, anxiety disorders, suicide attempts, conduct disorder
- Alcohol (40%) and tobacco (53%) use disorder high among individuals with cannabis use disorder
- Other substance use disorders likely to be high as well
- Approximately 25%-80% of those in treatment for another substance use disorder report use of cannabis
- High rates of concurrent mental disorders other than substance use disorders (major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, bipolar I disorder) among individuals with past-year or lifetime cannabis use disorder

**Physical Effects**:
- Few clear medical conditions that commonly co-occur with cannabis use disorder
- Most significant health effects involve respiratory system (bronchitis, sputum production, shortness of breath, wheezing) for chronic cannabis smokers.

##### Cannabis Intoxication

**Cannabis Intoxication**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- Recent use of cannabis
- Clinically significant problematic behavior or psychological changes (e.g., impaired motor coordination, euphoria, anxiety, sensation of slowed time, impaired judgment, social withdrawal) that developed during or shortly after cannabis use
- Two or more of the following signs/symptoms developing within 2 hours of cannabis use:
  - Conjunctival injection
  - Increased appetite
  - Dry mouth
  - Tachycardia
- The signs/symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another substance

**Specifiers**:
- With perceptual disturbances: Hallucinations with intact reality testing or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions in the absence of a delirium
- Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89, and the ICD-10-CM code depends on the presence of comorbid cannabis use disorder and perceptual disturbances

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Essential feature: Presence of clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes that develop during or shortly after cannabis use (Criterion B)
- Intoxication begins with a "high" feeling followed by symptoms such as euphoria, sedation, lethargy, impairment in short-term memory, difficulty carrying out complex mental processes, impaired judgment, distorted sensory perceptions, impaired motor performance, and the sensation that time is passing slowly
- Occasionally, anxiety (which can be severe), dysphoria, or social withdrawal may occur
- These psychoactive effects are accompanied by two or more of the following signs, developing within 2 hours of cannabis use: conjunctival injection, increased appetite, dry mouth, and tachycardia (Criterion C)
- Intoxication develops quickly if smoked but may take hours if ingested orally
- Effects usually last 3-4 hours, with duration longer for orally ingested cannabis
- Magnitude of changes depends on dose, method of administration, tolerance, and sensitivity

**Prevalence**:
- Prevalence of actual episodes of cannabis intoxication in the general population is unknown
- Probable that most cannabis users would experience cannabis intoxication at some point
- Prevalence of cannabis users and those experiencing cannabis intoxication are likely similar

**Functional Consequences**:
- Impairment from cannabis intoxication may have serious consequences, including dysfunction at work or school, social indiscretions, failure to fulfill role obligations, traffic accidents, and unprotected sex
- In rare cases, cannabis intoxication may precipitate a psychosis that varies in duration

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- If clinical presentation includes hallucinations without intact reality testing, consider substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder
- Cannabis intoxication may resemble intoxication with other substances (e.g., alcohol, sedatives), but is distinguished by effects on appetite, aggressive behavior, and nystagmus or ataxia
- Hallucinogens in low doses may cause a clinical picture similar to cannabis intoxication but are more likely to cause ataxia and aggressive behavior
- Cannabis intoxication is distinguished from other cannabis-induced disorders by the dominant symptoms and severity

##### Cannabis Withdrawal

**Cannabis Withdrawal Criteria (ICD-9-CM: 292.0; ICD-10-CM: F12.288)**
* **Heavy and prolonged cannabis use:** daily or almost daily use for months
* **Within approximately 1 week after cessation of heavy use:**
	+ Irritability, anger, or aggression
	+ Nervousness or anxiety
	+ Sleep difficulty (insomnia, disturbing dreams)
	+ Decreased appetite or weight loss
	+ Restlessness
	+ Depressed mood
	+ At least one physical symptom: abdominal pain, shakiness/tremors, sweating, fever, chills, headache
* **Significant distress or impairment:** socially, occupationally, or other important areas of functioning
* **Not attributable to another medical condition or better explained by another mental disorder**

**Symptoms Post-Abstinence:**
- Fatigue
- Yawning
- Difficulty concentrating
- Rebound periods: increased appetite and hypersomnia after loss

**Prevalence and Duration:**
- Up to one-third of regular cannabis users experience withdrawal
- Heavier use, comorbid symptoms linked to severity
- Symptoms start within first 24 hours, peak in the first week, last approximately 1-2 weeks for most symptoms; sleep difficulties may last more than 30 days.

**Risk and Prognostic Factors:**
- Greater prevalence and severity among heavier cannabis users seeking treatment
- Comorbid symptoms of mental disorders positively related to withdrawal severity
- Cannabis use disorder continuation: relief from withdrawal may contribute to ongoing use.

**Functional Consequences:**
- Disruptive effects observed in daily living by individuals close to cannabis users.

###### Distinguishing Cannabis Withdrawal Symptoms from Other Disorders

**Differential Diagnosis**

    7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities given up or reduced due to phencyclidine use
    8. Recurrent phencyclidine use in hazardous situations (e.g., driving)
    9. Phencyclidine use continued despite knowledge of a persistent or recurrent physical/psychological problem likely caused by phencyclidine
    10. **Tolerance**:
        - A need for markedly increased amounts to achieve intoxication or desired effect
        - Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount

**Specify If**:
- In early remission: After full criteria were previously met, none have been met for at least 3 months but less than 12 months (with exception of Criterion A4)
- In sustained remission: After full criteria were previously met, none have been met for 12+ months (with exception of Criterion A4)
- In a controlled environment: Restricted access to phencyclidines

**Coding Based on Current Severity**:
- If intoxication or another phencyclidine-induced mental disorder is present, use the codes for that condition instead

**Diagnostic Features of Phencyclidine Use Disorder**:
- Phencyclidine and similar substances (e.g., ketamine) produced as dissociative anesthetics in 1950s
- Became street drugs by 1960s, most commonly smoked or taken orally
- Primary psychoactive effects last for a few hours, total elimination 8+ days
- Hallucinogenic effects may persist for weeks, precipitating persistent psychotic episode
- Ketamine has utility in treating major depressive disorder
- Withdrawal symptoms not clearly established
- Phencyclidine can be detected in urine for up to 8 days or longer at high doses
- Characteristic symptoms: dissociative symptoms, analgesia, nystagmus, hypertension
- Violent behavior, belief of being attacked
- Residual symptoms may resemble schizophrenia.

###### Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Consequences of Phencyclidine Use Disorder

**Prevalence and Demographics**
- Unknown prevalence of phencyclidine use disorder
- Approx. 2.5% of population have ever used phencyclidine
- Proportion increases with age: 0.3% for 12-17 year olds, 1.3% for 18-25 year olds, 2.9% for those 26+
- Increase in ever used and past-year use among 12th graders (to 2.3% and 1.3%, respectively)
- Stable past-year use of ketamine among 12th graders (1.6-1.7%)

**Risk Factors**
- Little information on risk factors for phencyclidine use disorder
- Younger individuals admitted to substance abuse treatment
- Lower educational levels
- More likely to be located in the West and Northeast regions of the US compared to other admissions

**Cultural and Ethnic Differences**
- Higher prevalence of ketamine use among whites (0.5%) than other ethnic groups (0%-0.3%)
- Individuals with phencyclidine use disorder predominantly black (49%) or Hispanic (29%) in substance abuse treatment

**Gender Differences**
- Males account for 75% of phencyclidine-related emergency room visits

**Diagnostic Markers and Functional Consequences**
- Laboratory testing may be useful, as phencyclidine is present in urine up to 8 days after ingestion
- Physical signs: nystagmus, analgesia, prominent hypertension
- Chronic use may lead to deficits in memory, speech, and cognition lasting months
- Cardiovascular and neurological toxicities (seizures, dystonias, etc.)
- Intracranial hemorrhage, rhabdomyolysis, respiratory problems, and cardiac arrest possible consequences

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Distinguishing phencyclidine effects from other substances is important due to potential additive use (e.g., cannabis, cocaine)
- Symptoms may resemble schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder or other psychiatric disorders
- Phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder should be considered when there is impaired reality testing in individuals experiencing disturbances in perception resulting from ingestion of phencyclidine.

##### Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder

**Hallucinogen Use Disorder**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- A problematic pattern of hallucinogen (other than phencyclidine) use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following:
  - The hallucinogen is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than intended.
  - There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control hallucinogen use.
  - A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain, use, or recover from the effects of the hallucinogen.
  - Craving or a strong desire or urge to use the hallucinogen.
  - Recurrent hallucinogen use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated absences from work or poor performance related to hallucinogen use; hallucinogen-related absences, suspensions, or expulsions from school; neglect of children or household).
  - Continued hallucinogen use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the hallucinogen (e.g., arguments with a spouse about intoxication; physical fights).
  - Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced due to hallucinogen use.
  - Recurrent hallucinogen use in situations where it is physically hazardous (e.g., driving an automobile or operating a machine while impaired).
  - Hallucinogen use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that was likely caused or exacerbated by the hallucinogen.
  - Tolerance, as defined by either:
    - A need for markedly increased amounts of the hallucinogen to achieve intoxication or desired effect.
    - A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the hallucinogen.
- **Specify**: Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders in:
  - **Early remission**: After full criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (except for Criterion A4).
  - **Sustained remission**: After full criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (except for Criterion A4).
- **Specify**: In a controlled environment if the individual is in an environment where access to hallucinogens is restricted.

**Coding Based on Current Severity**:
- For ICD-9/ICD-10 codes, use the corresponding code for the specific hallucinogen and the severity level (mild, moderate, or severe).
- If a hallucinogen intoxication or another hallucinogen-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use the codes above for hallucinogen use disorder. Instead, indicate the comorbid hallucinogen use disorder in the 4th character of the code (e.g., F16.159 for mild hallucinogen use disorder with hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder).

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Hallucinogens include phenylalkylamines (e.g., mescaline, MDMA), indoleamines (e.g., psilocybin, DMT), and ergolines (e.g., LSD).
- These substances are usually taken orally but can also be smoked or taken intranasally/by injection.
- Duration of effects varies across types of hallucinogens; some have long half-lives, while others are short-acting.
- Tolerance develops with repeated use and has been reported to have both autonomic and psychological effects.
- Cross-tolerance exists between LSD and other hallucinogens but does not extend to other drug categories.
- MDMA/ecstasy may have distinctive effects due to its hallucinogenic and stimulant properties.
- Diagnostic criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder are arrayed along a continuum of severity.

**Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis**:
- Characteristic symptom features can aid in diagnosis if toxicology results are not available (e.g., visual hallucinations, temporary increase in suicidality).

###### Prevalence and Risk Factors of Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder in the US

**Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder: Prevalence and Characteristics**

**Prevalence**:
- Rare disorder with a 12-month prevalence of 0.5% among 12-17 year olds and 0.1% in adults over 18
- Higher rates in males (0.2%) compared to females (0.1%) in adults, opposite for adolescents (0.6% female > 0.4% male)
- Highest prevalence among individuals under 30 years old (0.6%) and decreases with age

**Racial Differences**:
- Marked ethnic differences: Native Americans and Alaska Natives have the highest rates (1.2%), followed by Hispanics (0.6%), Whites (0.6%), African Americans (0.2%), and Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders (0%)
- In adults, similar prevalence for Native Americans and Alaska Natives, Whites, and Hispanics (all 0.2%), lower in Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders (0.07%) and African Americans (0.03%)

**Clinical Samples**:
- Higher past-year prevalence (e.g., 19% in adolescents in treatment)
- Among hallucinogen users, 7.8% of adults and 17% of adolescents meet other hallucinogen use disorder criteria
- 73.5% of adult heavy ecstasy users and 77% of adolescent heavy ecstasy users have problematic patterns of use

**Development and Course**:
- Early age at onset is unclear, but early-onset users may be more likely to be polydrug users than later-onset counterparts
- Use of specific hallucinogens (e.g., MDMA/ecstasy) may increase the risk of other hallucinogen use disorder relative to other hallucinogens
- Low incidence, low persistence, and high recovery rates
- Elevated rates in adolescents, with 2.7% of youths ages 12-17 having used a hallucinogen in the past year

**Risk Factors**:
- **Temperamental**: MDMA use associated with elevated risk for other hallucinogen use disorder in adolescents, not consistently in adults
- **Other Substance Use Disorders**: Alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis associated with increased rates; alcohol may be a precursor to hallucinogen use
- **Personality Disorders**: Antisocial personality disorder elevated among individuals using more than two other drugs in addition to hallucinogens
- **Use of Specific Hallucinogens**: Salvia usage prominent among 18-25 year olds with other risk-taking behaviors and illegal activities; cannabis use may increase ecstasy initiation
- **Genetic and Physiological**: Total variance due to additive genetics ranges from 26% to 79%; inconsistent evidence for shared environmental influences

**Religious Use**:
- Hallucinogens used in religious practices (e.g., peyote in Native American Church, ayahuasca in certain sects) does not result in neuropsychological or psychological deficits for adults
- No race/ethnicity differences for full criteria or individual criteria at this time

**Gender Differences**:
- Females less likely to endorse hazardous use and may be more likely to have other hallucinogen use disorder, especially in adolescents

**Laboratory Testing**:
- Useful in distinguishing different hallucinogens but may not always reveal the specific substance used due to potency (e.g., LSD)

##### Phencyclidine Intoxication

**Functional Consequences of Phencyclidine Intoxication+**
- Long-term neurotoxic effects:
  - Impairments in memory, psychological function, and neuroendocrine function
  - Serotonin system dysfunction
  - Sleep disturbance
  - Adverse effects on brain microvasculature, white matter maturation, and axon damage
  - Decreased functional connectivity between brain regions
- Distinguishing from other substance use disorders:
  - Different effects of phencyclidine from other drugs (e.g., amphetamines) due to contamination or different mechanisms of action
  - Rule out schizophrenia and other mental disorders, medical conditions, or drug withdrawals
- Comorbidity:
  - Individuals who use hallucinogens, including phencyclidine, have higher rates of other substance use disorders, mental health disorders (especially anxiety, depressive, and bipolar), antisocial personality disorder, and adult antisocial behavior. However, it's unclear whether these disorders precede or follow the use of hallucinogens.
  - Polydrug users and individuals with other drug use disorders are more likely to use phencyclidine as well.
- Phencyclidine Intoxication Diagnostic Criteria:
  1. Recent use of phencyclidine (or a pharmacologically similar substance)
  2. Clinically significant problematic behavioral changes within 1 hour after use, such as belligerence, assaultiveness, impulsiveness, unpredictability, psychomotor agitation, and impaired judgment
  3. Any combination of the following signs or symptoms:
     - Vertical or horizontal nystagmus
     - Hypertension or tachycardia
     - Numbness or diminished responsiveness to pain
     - Ataxia
     - Dysarthria
     - Muscle rigidity
     - Seizures or coma
     - Hyperacusis
  4. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder, including phencyclidine use disorder (if applicable).
- Coding:
  - ICD-9-CM code: 292.89
  - ICD-10-CM codes depend on comorbid phencyclidine use disorder:
    - Mild phencyclidine use disorder: F16.129
    - Moderate or severe phencyclidine use disorder: F16.229
    - No comorbid phencyclidine use disorder: F16.929
- Functional consequences of intoxication:
  - Extensive cardiovascular and neurological toxicity, including seizures, dystonias, dyskinesias, catalepsy, hypothermia or hyperthermia.
- Differential diagnosis:
  - Distinguish from other substance intoxications (e.g., hallucinogens, amphetamines) and withdrawal states based on clinical presentation and toxicological tests. However, there is a weak correlation between quantitative toxicology levels of phencyclidine and clinical presentation.
  - Consider other conditions like schizophrenia, depression, metabolic disorders, central nervous system tumors, seizure disorders, sepsis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and vascular insults.

##### Other Hallucinogen Intoxication

- Increased risk for suicidality, though rare

**Functional Consequences:**
- Perceptual disturbances and impaired judgment can lead to injuries/fatalities from automobile crashes, physical fights, unintentional self-injury
- Continued use of hallucinogens, particularly MDMA, linked with neurotoxic effects

**Differentiation:**
- Other hallucinogen intoxication vs. other substance intoxications (amphetamines, cocaine, other stimulants; anticholinergics; inhalants; phencyclidine) using toxicological tests and determination of route of administration
- Other disorders and conditions: schizophrenia, depression, withdrawal from sedatives/alcohol, metabolic disorders, seizure disorders, tumors, vascular insults, hallucinogen persisting perception disorder.

##### Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder

**Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD)**

**Criteria for Diagnosis**:
- **Criterion A**: Reexperiencing perceptual symptoms after cessation of hallucinogen use (e.g., geometric hallucinations, false perceptions, flashes of color, etc.) that cause distress or impairment in functioning
- **Criterion B**: Symptoms last weeks, months, or years and cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas
- **Criterion C**: Rule out other explanations for symptoms (e.g., brain lesions, preexisting psychosis, seizure disorders) and other mental disorders like delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, schizophrenia, etc.

**Features of HPPD**:
- Reexperiencing perceptual disturbances after hallucinogen use (e.g., LSD), but not exclusive to it
- Duration can be episodic or nearly continuous
- Visual disturbances are most common and predominant
- Other phenomena like auditory or tactile hallucinations may occur but are less common
- Reality testing remains intact, individual aware the symptoms are linked to drug use

**Prevalence and Course**:
- Prevalence estimates unknown, approximately 4.2% among hallucinogen users initially
- Persistent condition lasting weeks, months, or years in some cases
- Risk factors not well understood but genetic factors suggested as possible explanation

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Rule out other conditions like schizophrenia, drug effects, neurodegenerative disorders, stroke, brain tumors, infections, head trauma
- Reality testing remains intact, so if individual is not aware symptoms linked to drug use, consider another disorder (e.g., psychotic disorder, delirium)

**Comorbidities**:
- Common comorbid mental disorders: panic disorder, alcohol use disorder, major depressive disorder

**Other Phencyclidine-Induced Disorders**:
- Phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, intoxication delirium diagnosed instead of phencyclidine intoxication when severe enough for independent clinical attention.

##### Other Hallucinogen-Induced Disorders

**Hallucinogen-Induced Disorders**

**Other Hallucinogen-Induced Psychotic Disorder:**
- Diagnosed in "Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders" chapter

**Other Hallucinogen-Induced Bipolar Disorder:**
- Diagnosed in "Bipolar and Related Disorders" chapter

**Other Hallucinogen-Induced Depressive Disorder:**
- Diagnosed in "Depressive Disorders" chapter

**Other Hallucinogen-Induced Anxiety Disorder:**
- Diagnosed in "Anxiety Disorders" chapter

**Hallucinogen Intoxication Delirium:**
- Criteria and discussion found in the chapter on "Neurocognitive Disorders"

**Unspecified Phencyclidine (PCP)-Related Disorder:**
- For presentations with symptoms of a phencyclidine-related disorder causing distress or impairment but not meeting full criteria for any specific disorder
- Diagnosis: 292.9 (F16.99) "Unspecified Phencyclidine-Related Disorder"

##### Unspecified Hallucinogen -Related Disorder

**Unspecified Hallucinogen-Related Disorder (F16.99)**

**Characteristics**:
- Symptoms characteristic of a hallucinogen-related disorder
- Cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
- Do not meet the full criteria for any specific hallucinogen-related disorder or substance-related and addictive disorders

**Diagnostic Approach**:
- Consider presentation as an **Unspecified Hallucinogen-Related Disorder (F16.99)** if:
  - Symptoms are indicative of a hallucinogen-related disorder
  - However, they do not meet the full criteria for any specific hallucinogen-related or substance-related/addictive disorders

**Implications**:
- If diagnosed with **Unspecified Hallucinogen-Related Disorder (F16.99)**, the individual may still experience clinically significant distress and impairment related to their hallucinogen use, but this diagnosis acknowledges that it does not fit neatly into any specific diagnostic category.
- Treatment approaches for this disorder would focus on managing symptoms and improving functioning, rather than abstinence from the drug itself.

#### Inhalant-Related Disorders

**Inhalant Use Disorder (IUD)**
- **Criteria for Diagnosis**: A problematic pattern of using hydrocarbon-based inhalants leading to impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following symptoms within a 12-month period:
  1. Taking larger amounts or over longer periods than intended
  2. Persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to control use
  3. Spending significant time obtaining, using, or recovering from effects
  4. Craving or strong urge to use the inhalant
  5. Failing major role obligations due to inhalant use
  6. Continued use despite social/interpersonal problems caused by the substance
  7. Giving up important activities due to inhalant use
  8. Use in hazardous situations
  9. Continued use despite knowing of physical or psychological problems caused by the substance
  10. Tolerance or diminished effect with continued use
- **Specifiers**:
  - **In early remission**: After full criteria were previously met, but not for at least 3 months (with exception of craving)
  - **In sustained remission**: After full criteria were previously met, for a period of 12 months or longer (with exception of craving)
- **Coding and Severity**:
  - Use of inhalant intoxication or another inhalant-induced mental disorder codes instead if present
  - Codes based on current severity: Mild (2-3 symptoms), Moderate (4-5 symptoms), Severe (6 or more symptoms)

**Diagnostic Features and Associated Symptoms**:
- Repeated use despite knowing it causes serious problems
- Missing work or school, inability to fulfill responsibilities
- Continued use causing arguments with family/friends, fights
- Limiting social activities, sports, hobbies
- Use while driving or operating dangerous equipment
- Tolerance and mild withdrawal (reported by about 10% of users)
- Association with past suicide attempts, especially in adults reporting low mood or anhedonia.

###### Inhalant Use Disorder: Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Diagnostic Considerations

**Prevalence of Inhalant Use Disorder**
- About 0.4% of Americans ages 12-17 meet criteria for inhalant use disorder in the past year
- Highest prevalence in Native Americans, lowest in African Americans
- Prevalence falls to about 0.1% among 18-29-year-olds and 0.02% in all adults 18+ years old

**Development and Course**
- 10% of 13-year-old American children report using inhalants at least once
- Prevalence is highest in adolescents, declines after early adulthood
- Behavioral disinhibition, childhood maltreatment/trauma, and genetic factors contribute to progression from nonuse to disorder

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**
- Temperamental: predictors include comorbid substance use disorders, conduct/antisocial disorder, early onset use, prior mental health treatment
- Environmental: wide availability of inhalants increases risk
- Genetic and physiological: behavioral disinhibition, family history of substance/mental health issues

**Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues**
- High prevalence in some native or aboriginal communities and homeless street gangs
- Almost identical prevalence in adolescent males and females, but rare among adult females

**Diagnostic Markers**
- Urine, breath, saliva tests may indicate concurrent use of non-inhalant substances
- Limited practicality for frequent biological testing due to technical issues and expense

**Functional Consequences of Inhalant Use Disorder**
- Sudden sniffing death from cardiac arrhythmia or asphyxiation
- Impaired neurobehavioral function, neurological problems, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, pulmonary issues
- Increased risk for tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, depression, anxiety, bronchitis, asthma, sinusitis
- Deaths from respiratory depression, arrhythmias, accidents, or suicide attempts

**Different Diagnostic Considerations**
- Inhalant exposure (unintentional) vs. use without disorder
- Inhalant intoxication vs. use disorder symptoms
- Comorbid disorders like psychosis, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, neurocognitive disorder
- Other substance use disorders, toxic/metabolic disorders, traumatic/neoplastic/infectious disorders

##### Inhalant Intoxication

**Inhalant Intoxication Criteria:**
- Recent, intentional or unintentional exposure to volatile hydrocarbons like toluene or gasoline
- Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., belligerence, assaultiveness, apathy, impaired judgment) during/after exposure
- Two or more of the following signs or symptoms: dizziness, nystagmus, incoordination, slurred speech, unsteady gait, lethargy, depressed reflexes, psychomotor retardation, tremor, muscle weakness, blurred vision or diplopia, stupor or coma, euphoria
- Signs/symptoms not attributable to another medical condition or mental disorder (except intoxication with another substance)

**Coding:**
- ICD-9-CM: 292.89
- ICD-10-CM depends on comorbid inhalant use disorder: F18.129 for mild, F18.229 for moderate/severe, F18.929 if no comorbidity

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Inhalant intoxication is a mental disorder related to inhalation of volatile hydrocarbons
- May indicate possession or lingering odors of inhalant substances, apparent intoxication, negative results on standard drug screens, high prevalence in certain age groups and genders.

**Prevalence:**
- Prevalence of actual episodes unknown but likely similar to that of inhalant use disorder (0.8% overall, 3.6% among 12-17 years old)

**Gender Differences:**
- No significant differences known; gender ratios for prevalence are roughly equal but more females use among younger age groups

**Functional Consequences:**
- Can lead to unconsciousness, anoxia, cardiac arrhythmias or arrest, fatalities from enhanced toxicity of certain volatile inhalants
- Short-term intoxication may cause persisting medical and neurological problems if frequent

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Inhalant exposure without diagnostic criteria for use disorder
- Intoxication from other substances or medications
- Other inhalant-related disorders (use disorder, neurocognitive disorder, psychotic disorder, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder)
- Numerous neurological and medical conditions that may cause similar symptoms.

##### Other Inhalant-Induced Disorders

**Inhalant-Induced Disorders:**
* **Inhalant-induced psychotic disorder ("Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders")**
* **Inhalant-induced depressive disorder ("Depressive Disorders")**
* **Inhalant-induced anxiety disorder ("Anxiety Disorders")**
* **Inhalant-induced major or mild neurocognitive disorder ("Neurocognitive Disorders")**
* For inhalant intoxication delirium, see "Delirium" in the chapter on "Neurocognitive Disorders."

**Unspecified Inhalant-Related Disorder (292.9):**
* This category is for presentations with symptoms of an inhalant-related disorder causing clinically significant distress or impairment but not meeting full criteria for any specific disorder or Substance/Addictive Disorders diagnostic class.

#### Opioid-Related Disorders

**Opioid-Related Disorders**
- **Opioid Use Disorder**:
  - Opiold Intoxication:
    - Result of opioid use or misuse, leading to impaired functioning
  - Opioid Withdrawal:
    - Physiological and emotional symptoms following cessation of opioid use
  - Other Opioid-Induced Disorders:
    - Unspecified Opioid-Related Disorder:
      - Disorder related to opioids without a specific diagnosis

##### Opioid Use Disorder

**Opioid Use Disorder**

**Diagnostic Criteria**: A problematic pattern of opioid use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month period:
- Opioids are often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than intended.
- Persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control opioid use.
- A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain, use, or recover from the effects of opioids.
- Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use opioids.
- Recurrent opioid use resulting in failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home.
- Continued opioid use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused by the effects of opioids.
- Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of opioid use.
- Recurrent opioid use in situations where it is physically hazardous.
- Continued opioid use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that was caused or exacerbated by the substance.
- Tolerance, as defined by:
  - Markedly increased amounts of opioids needed to achieve intoxication or desired effect.
  - A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of an opioid.
- Withdrawal, as manifested by:
  - The characteristic opioid withdrawal syndrome (refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria set for opioid withdrawal).
  - Opioids (or a closely related substance) are taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

**Specifiers**:
- In early remission: After full criteria for opioid use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for opioid use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (except for "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use opioids").
- In sustained remission: After full criteria for opioid use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for opioid use disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (except for "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use opioids").
- On maintenance therapy: If the individual is taking a prescribed agonist medication such as methadone or buprenorphine and none of the criteria for opioid use disorder have been met for that class of medication (except tolerance).
- In a controlled environment: If the individual is in an environment where access to opioids is restricted.

**Coding**: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an opioid intoxication, opioid withdrawal, or another opioid-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for opioid use disorder. Instead, the comorbid opioid use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the opioid-induced disorder code (e.g., F11.14 for mild opioid use disorder with opioid-induced depressive disorder).

**Current Severity**:
- Mild: Presence of 2-3 symptoms
- Moderate: Presence of 4-5 symptoms
- Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms

**Associated Features and Comorbidities**:
- Opioid use disorder can be associated with a history of drug-related crimes (e.g., possession, distribution)
- Marital difficulties, unemployment, and irregular employment are often associated with opioid use disorder

###### Prevalence and Consequences of Opioid Use Disorder

**Opioid Use Disorder Prevalence and Demographics:**
* Approximately 0.37% prevalence among adults age 18+ in the community (underestimated due to incarcerated individuals)
* Higher in males than females (0.49% vs. 0.26%) with a male-to-female ratio of 1.5:1 for opioids other than heroin and 3:1 for heroin
* Females may have a higher likelihood of developing opioid use disorders, especially adolescent females
* Prevalence decreases with age (0.82% among those under age 30 vs. 0.09% among those over age 65)
* Lower prevalence in African Americans at 0.18% and overrepresented in Native Americans at 1.25%, close to average among whites, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics
* Higher 12-month prevalence of opioid use disorder (approximately 1%) among individuals ages 12-17 years compared to heroin use disorder (less than 0.1%). Analgesic use disorder is also prevalent in this age group
* Between 0.1% and 0.8% 12-month prevalence of problem opioid use in European countries, average being between 0.36% and 0.44%

**Development and Course:**
* Opioid use disorder can develop at any age but most commonly first observed in late teens or early 20s
* Once developed, usually continues for many years with frequent relapses and abstinence periods
* Long-term mortality rates as high as 2% per year, about 20-30% achieve long-term abstinence (exceptions: military personnel who became dependent on opioids in Vietnam)
* Decrease in prevalence with increasing age due to early mortality and "maturing out" but many continue having presentations for decades

**Risk and Prognostic Factors:**
* Genetic factors play a crucial role both directly and indirectly through impulsivity, novelty seeking, peer selection, and cultural influences
* Medical personnel with access to opioids at increased risk for opioid use disorder

**Diagnostic Markers:**
* Routine urine toxicology tests often positive for opioids in individuals with opioid use disorder
* Opioids like heroin, morphine, codeine, oxycodone, propoxyphene detected for 12-36 hours after administration. Fentanyl not detected on routine tests but can be identified by more specialized procedures
* Methadone, buprenorphine/naloxone combination, and LAAM specifically tested for, detected for several days up to over a week

**Complications:**
* Small variations in criterion items, opioid use disorder diagnostic criteria perform equally well across race/ethnicity groups
* Individuals from ethnic minority populations living in economically deprived areas overrepresented among individuals with opioid use disorder
* Over time, more common among white middle-class individuals, especially females
* Increased risk for suicide attempts and completed suicides, including accidental and deliberate overdoses
* Lack of mucous membrane secretions causing dry mouth and nose; impaired visual acuity through pupillary constriction; sclerosed veins ("tracks") and puncture marks on the lower extremities; infections like tetanus, hepatitis A/B/C, HIV, tuberculosis, and endocarditis; sexual dysfunctions; mortality rate as high as 1.5-2% per year due to overdose, accidents, injuries, AIDS, or other general medical complications
* Violence accounts for a significant number of opioid-related deaths in some areas. Physiological dependence on opioids may occur in about half of infants born to females with opioid use disorder, causing severe withdrawal syndrome requiring medical treatment. Low birth weight not marked but can have serious consequences.

###### Opioid Use Disorder: Diagnosis, Comorbidities, and Associated Mental Health Issues

**Differential Diagnosis of Opioid-Induced Mental Disorders**

**Opioid-Induced Disorders**:
- Occur frequently in individuals with opioid use disorder
- May be characterized by symptoms that resemble primary mental disorders (e.g., depressive mood)
- Less likely to produce symptoms of mental disturbance than other drugs of abuse

**Opioid Intoxication and Opioid Withdrawal**:
- Distinguished from other opioid-induced disorders due to predominating clinical presentation and severity
- **Opioid intoxication**: can resemble alcohol or sedative/hypnotic intoxication, but absence of pupillary constriction or lack of response to naloxone challenge distinguishes it
- **Opioid withdrawal**: accompanied by symptoms like rhinorrhea, lacrimation, and pupillary dilation, which are not seen in sedative-type withdrawal

**Other Substance Intoxication and Withdrawal Disorders**:
- Alcohol or sedative/hypnotic intoxication can resemble opioid intoxication
- Naloxone challenge can be used to differentiate between opioid and other substance intoxications
- Opioid withdrawal symptoms may be present in conjunction with other substance withdrawals

**Comorbidities**:
- **Most common medical conditions associated with opioid use disorder**: viral (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C) and bacterial infections
- **Other substance use disorders** often co-occur, especially tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, stimulants, and benzodiazepines
- Opioid use disorder is associated with **mild to moderate depression**, which may represent an opioid-induced depressive disorder or exacerbation of a preexisting primary depressive disorder
- **Insomnia** is common, especially during withdrawal
- **Antisocial personality disorder** and **posttraumatic stress disorder** are more common in individuals with opioid use disorder
- A history of **conduct disorder** in childhood or adolescence is a significant risk factor for substance-related disorders, especially opioid use disorder

##### Opioid Intoxication

**Opioid Intoxication Diagnostic Criteria**

A. **Recent use of an opioid**
- Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes
- Developed during or shortly after opioid use (e.g., initial euphoria followed by apathy, dysphoria, psychomotor agitation or retardation, impaired judgment)

B. **Opioid Use and Symptoms:**
- Pupillary constriction (unless there has been a severe overdose with consequent anoxia and pupillary dilation)
- One or more signs: drowsiness ("on the nod"), slurred speech, impairment in attention or memory
- Drowsiness may progress to coma
- Individuals may ignore potentially harmful events due to inattention

C. **Exclusions:**
- Signs not attributable to another medical condition
- Not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., alcohol intoxication, sedative-hypnotic intoxication) or opioid-related disorders like opioid-induced depressive disorder with onset during intoxication.

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Other substance intoxications: alcohol, sedative-hypnotics
  - Absence of pupillary constriction or lack of response to naloxone challenge may help distinguish opioid intoxication from others.
- Opioid intoxication can coexist with alcohol or other sedatives; naloxone challenge will not reverse all sedative effects in such cases.

**Coding:**
- ICD-9-CM: 292.89
- ICD-10-CM: F11.129 (mild opioid use disorder), F11.229 (moderate or severe opioid use disorder), F11.929 (no comorbid opioid use disorder) for intoxication without perceptual disturbances
- ICD-10-CM: F11.122, F11.222, F11.922 for intoxication with perceptual disturbances.

##### Opioid Withdrawal

**Opioid Withdrawal Diagnostic Criteria (ICD-10-CM F11.23)**

A. **Presence of either:**
- **Criterion A1:** Cessation or reduction in opioid use for several weeks or longer
- **Criterion A2:** Administration of an opioid antagonist after prolonged opioid use

B. **Three or more of the following developing within minutes to several days after Criteria A1 or A2:**
- Dysphoric mood
- Nausea or vomiting
- Muscle aches
- Lacrimation or rhinorrhea
- Pupillary dilation, piloerection, sweating
- Diarrhea
- Yawning
- Fever
- Insomnia

C. **Signs and symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning.**

D. **Not attributable to another medical condition or mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.**

**Characteristics of Opioid Withdrawal:**
- Opposite effects of acute agonist effects
- Subjective complaints: anxiety, restlessness, achy feeling (back and legs), irritability, increased sensitivity to pain
- Physiological changes: pupillary dilation, piloerection, sweating, diarrhea, yawning, fever, insomnia
- More severe withdrawal symptoms: piloerection and fever

**Symptoms Duration:** Acute symptoms peak within 1-3 days, gradually subside over 5-7 days; chronic symptoms may last for weeks to months.

**Associated Features:**
- Males with opioid withdrawal may experience piloerection, sweating, and spontaneous ejaculations while awake.
- Opioid withdrawal is not always accompanied by drug-seeking behavior.

**Prevalence:** Occurs in 60% of individuals who have used heroin at least once within the past 12 months.

**Differential Diagnosis:** Sedative-hypnotic withdrawal, other substance intoxication, opioid-induced disorders.

##### Other Opioid-lnduced Disorders

**Opioid-Induced Disorders**

**Description:**
- Various opioid-induced disorders mentioned in different chapters of this manual
- Shared phenomenology with certain disorders: depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, sleep disorder, sexual dysfunction

**Diagnosis:**
- Applies to presentations with symptoms causing distress or impairment but not meeting full criteria for specific disorders
- Unspecified Opioid-Related Disorder (F11.99)

**Criteria and Discussion:**
- Diagnosed instead of opioid intoxication or withdrawal only when severe enough to warrant clinical attention
- Symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning

#### Sedative-, Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic- Related Disorders

**Sedative-, Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic-Related Disorders**

  - Important activities given up or reduced due to sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use
  - Use despite physical/psychological problem likely caused by sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
  - Tolerance (markedly increased amount needed for effect or diminished effect)
  - Withdrawal (characteristic withdrawal syndrome or use to avoid symptoms)

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances include benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and other related drugs
- Available by prescription and illegally
- Misuse can occur alone or with other substances (e.g., to "come down" from other drugs)
- Symptoms may include absences/poor performance, arguments about use, avoiding activities, and withdrawal symptoms
- Tolerance and dependence can develop

**Associated Features**:
- Often associated with other substance use disorders (alcohol, cannabis, opioids, stimulants)
- Intense or repeated intoxication may lead to severe depression, suicide attempt, or completed suicide.

###### Prevalence and Characteristics of Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder

**Prevalence**
- **DSM-IV sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder**: estimated at:
  - 0.3% among 12-to 17-year-olds
  - 0.2% among adults age 18 and older
- Slightly higher rate in adult males (0.3%) compared to adult females (0.2%) for 12-to 17-year-olds; higher female rate (0.4%) vs. male (0.2%) rate for 12-to 17-year-olds
- Highest 12-month prevalence in 18-to 29-year-olds (0.5%), lowest in individuals 65 and older (0.04%)
- Variations across racial/ethnic subgroups:
  - Whites have highest rates (0.3%) among 12-to 17-year-olds, compared to African Americans (0.2%), Hispanics (0.2%), Native Americans (0.1%), and Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders (0.1%)
  - Adults: highest rates in Native Americans and Alaska Natives (0.8%), approximately 0.2% for African Americans, whites, and Hispanics, 0.1% for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders

**Development and Course**
- Typical course involves teenagers/young adults who escalate use of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic agents, leading to problems and diagnosis
- Second clinical course: individual obtains medication by prescription for anxiety, insomnia, or somatic complaints; develops tolerance and increases dose/frequency; may seek multiple prescriptions; can result in severe withdrawal and toxicity
- Onset of use often occurs during adolescence or early adulthood
- Increased risk for misuse with age, especially cognitive impairment as a side effect
- Deliberate intoxication more common among teenagers and young adults; problems also seen in 40s+ as dose escalation leads to intolerance and dependence

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**
- Temperament: impulsivity, novelty seeking
- Availability of substances, prescription patterns
- Peer factors
- Genetic predisposition
- Early onset use associated with greater likelihood for disorder development

**Diagnostic Issues**
- Variations in prescription patterns and availability across countries
- Higher risk for females than males for prescription drug misuse
- Difficulty distinguishing sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders from primary mental disorders, medical conditions, alcohol use disorder

**Functional Consequences of Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder**

- Physical examination may reveal autonomic nervous system dysfunction, slower pulse, decreased respiratory rate, lower blood pressure
- Overdoses can result in deterioration of vital signs, lethality (especially with alcohol), trauma, medical complications from IV use

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Distinguish from other mental disorders: anxiety disorders, alcohol use disorder, medical conditions
- Alcohol use disorder: clinically appropriate use vs. misuse/disorder
- Comorbidities: antisocial personality disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, illicit drug use

**Complications of Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder**
- Accidental overdoses (alcohol-benzodiazepine combinations especially dangerous)

  - Slurred speech
  - Incoordination
  - Unsteady gait
  - Nystagmus
  - Impairment in cognition (e.g., attention, memory)
  - Stupor or coma
- **D.** The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder

**Coding**:
- ICD-9-CM code: 292.89
- ICD-10-CM code depends on the presence of a comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder
  - Mild sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder: F13.129
  - Moderate or severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder: F13.229
  - No comorbid use disorder: F13.929

**Associated Features**:

- Mixing sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic agents with alcohol to markedly increase effects

**Prevalence and Differential Diagnosis**:
- Prevalence in the general population unclear, but may be similar to that of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder
- Distinguishing from **alcohol use disorders**: requires evidence of recent ingestion of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic medications
- Differentiating from other sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders: symptoms predominant and severe enough to warrant clinical attention

##### Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal

**Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal**

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- **Criterion A**: Cessation or reduction in sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use lasting several hours to a few days
- **Criterion B**: Two (or more) of the following developing within several hours to a few days after Criterion A:
  - Autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., sweating, pulse rate >100 bpm)
  - Hand tremor
  - Insomnia
  - Nausea or vomiting
  - Transient visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusions
  - Psychomotor agitation
  - Anxiety
  - Grand mal seizures
- **Criterion C**: Signs or symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning
- **Criterion D**: Not attributable to another medical condition or better explained by another mental disorder (including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance)

**Specifiers:**
- With perceptual disturbances: Hallucinations with intact reality testing or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions in the absence of a delirium
  - ICD-9-CM code: 292.0
  - ICD-10-CM codes: F13.239 (without perceptual disturbances) and F13.232 (with perceptual disturbances)

**Note:** The ICD-10-CM codes indicate the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. It is not permissible to code a comorbid mild sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder with sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal.

###### Sedative-Hypnotic Withdrawal Syndrome Diagnostic Criteria

**Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal**

**Essential Features**:
- Presence of a characteristic syndrome developing after a marked decrease or cessation of intake for weeks or more (Criteria A and B)
- Syndrome characterized by:
  - Autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., increased heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, body temperature, sweating)
  - Tremor of the hands
  - Insomnia
  - Nausea with vomiting
  - Anxiety
  - Psychomotor agitation
- Possible occurrence of grand mal seizures (up to 20%-30%)
- In severe withdrawal: visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusions in the context of delirium

**Supporting Features**:
- Timing and severity of withdrawal syndrome vary depending on specific substance and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics
- Withdrawal from shorter-acting substances can begin hours after cessation, while longer-acting ones may take 1-2 days or more to start
- Withdrawal from long-acting substances may be life-threatening due to delirium
- Evidence of tolerance and withdrawal in absence of a diagnosis of substance use disorder when stopping benzodiazepines for long periods at therapeutic doses

**Prevalence**:
- Prevalence unclear

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Other medical disorders (e.g., hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis) that may mimic withdrawal symptoms
- Seizures in the setting of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal suggest a high likelihood of withdrawal
- Differential diagnosis includes various causes of seizures (e.g., infections, head injury, poisonings) if they are a feature of the withdrawal
- Essential tremor, a familial disorder, may resemble the tremulousness associated with withdrawal
- Alcohol withdrawal produces a syndrome very similar to sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal.

##### Other sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders

**Sedative-, Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic-Induced Disorders**

**Withdrawal vs. Other Induced Disorders**:
- **Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal** is distinguished from other induced disorders (e.g., sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced anxiety disorder) by the predominance of symptoms in the latter and their severity
- Anxiety disorders can also recur or worsen, producing a syndrome similar to withdrawal
- Distinguishing withdrawal from underlying anxiety disorder is difficult when tapering medication
- Withdrawal symptoms (e.g., anxiety, moodiness, sleep trouble) can be mistaken for other disorders

**Other Sedative-, Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic-Induced Disorders**:
- Described in chapters on related disorders (e.g., psychosis, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, sexual dysfunctions, neurocognitive disorders)
- Diagnosed instead of intoxication or withdrawal only when symptoms are severe enough

**Unspecified Sedative-, Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic-Related Disorder**:
- Category for presentations with dominant symptoms of a sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-related disorder but not meeting full criteria for any specific disorder

#### Stimulant-Related Disorders

**Stimulant Use Disorder**

**Criteria**:
- A pattern of stimulant use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress
- At least two of the following signs in a 12-month period:
  1. Taking larger than intended amounts
  2. Persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down
  3. Spending much time on obtaining, using, or recovering from stimulant effects
  4. Craving or strong urge to use
  5. Failing major obligations due to stimulant use
  6. Using despite social/interpersonal problems caused by the stimulant
  7. Giving up important activities due to stimulant use
  8. Use in hazardous situations
  9. Continued use despite persistent physical or psychological problems
  - Tolerance:
    a. Needing more to achieve intoxication
    b. Diminished effect with continued use
- Withdrawal symptoms (when applicable):
  a. Characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the stimulant
  b. Taking the stimulant or related substance to avoid withdrawal symptoms

**Specifiers**:
- In early remission: No full criteria have been met for at least 3 months but less than 12 months
- In sustained remission: No full criteria have been met for at least 12 months
- Controlled environment: Access to stimulants is restricted

**Coding**:
- Use the appropriate code based on severity (mild, moderate, or severe) and current status. If comorbid with another stimulant disorder, use the specific code with the "4th character" indicating the comorbid disorder's severity.

###### Amphetamine and Cocaine Use Disorder: Symptoms, Effects, and Withdrawal

**Amphetamine and Amphetamine-Type Stimulants**

**Substances Included**:
- Substituted-phenylethylamine structure drugs (amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, methamphetamine)
- Structurally different but similar effect drugs (methylphenidate)
- Synthetic stimulants may be obtained by prescription for treatment of obesity, ADHD, and narcolepsy

**Different Routes of Administration**:
- Orally or intravenously
- Khat is a plant-derived natural stimulant

**Cocaine**
- Consumed in several preparations (coca leaves, coca paste, cocaine hydrochloride)
- Active ingredient in all forms is cocaine
- Tolerance and withdrawal symptoms, including hypersomnia, increased appetite, and dysphoria, can occur
- Effects of use patterns and course are similar to amphetamine-type stimulants

**Use Patterns and Course**:
- Use may be chronic or episodic, with binges punctuated by brief non-use periods
- Aggressive or violent behavior common with high doses
- Intense temporary anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychotic episodes seen with high-dose use
- Depressive symptoms, resembling major depressive episode, can occur during withdrawal
- Tolerance leads to escalation of dose; some users develop sensitization (enhanced effects)

**Supporting Features for Diagnosis**:
- Instant feeling of well-being and confidence with use
- Dramatic behavioral changes can rapidly develop
- Chaotic behavior, social isolation, aggressive behavior, and sexual dysfunction common after long-term use
- Individuals may experience paranoid ideation, auditory hallucinations, and tactile hallucinations during intoxication
- Depression, suicidal ideation, irritability, anhedonia, emotional lability, or disturbances in attention and concentration occur during withdrawal
- Physiological changes opposite to those of the intoxication phase, sometimes including bradycardia
- Temporary depressive symptoms may meet criteria for major depressive episode
- Histories consistent with panic attacks, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), generalized anxiety disorder are common
- Stimulant toxicity can lead to stimulant-induced psychotic disorder, resembling schizophrenia
- Conditioned responses to drug-related stimuli contribute to relapse and persist after detoxification.

###### Substance Use Disorders: Prevalence and Risk Factors for Amphetamine and Cocaine

**Stimulant Use Disorders Prevalence**
* Amphetamine-type stimulants:
  * 12-month prevalence: 0.2% for 12-17 year olds, 0.2% for individuals over 18

###### Stimulant Use Disorders: Diagnosis, Consequences, and Differential Diagnosis

**Diagnostic Markers for Stimulant Use Disorder**

**Cocaine:**
- Benzoylecgonine metabolite: present for 1-3 days after single dose, up to 7-12 days with repeated high doses
- Mildly elevated liver function tests in chronic users or those with alcohol use
- No neurobiological markers of diagnostic utility
- Electroencephalographic changes, prolactin alterations, dopamine receptor downregulation possible after chronic use

**Amphetamine-Type Stimulants:**
- MDMA (ecstasy), methamphetamine: detectable for 1-3 days, up to 4 days depending on dosage and metabolism
- Hair samples can detect presence for up to 90 days
- Similar laboratory findings, physical symptoms as cocaine use

**Functional Consequences of Stimulant Use Disorder**
- Medical conditions: sinusitis, nasal bleeding, perforated septum (intranasal), chest pain, myocardial infarction, palpitations/arrhythmias, stroke, seizures, pneumothorax, trauma injuries
- Obstetric complications: irregularities in placental blood flow, abruptio placentae, premature labor and delivery, low birth weights
- Behavioral issues: theft, prostitution, drug dealing
- Neurocognitive impairment common among methamphetamine users
- Oral health problems: gum disease, tooth decay, mouth sores, bruxism
- Adverse pulmonary effects less common for amphetamine-type stimulants due to fewer smoking instances per day
- Emergency department visits common for mental disorders, injuries, skin infections, dental pathology

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Primary mental disorders: major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar and depressive disorders, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder
- Intoxication with phencyclidine or designer drugs (PCP, mephedrone): similar clinical picture; distinguish by presence of cocaine or amphetamine metabolites in urine or plasma samples
- Stimulant intoxication vs. withdrawal: symptoms predominate and require independent clinical attention in latter disorders

**Comorbidities:**
- Substance use disorders, especially those with sedative properties (alcohol, cannabis) to counteract stimulant side effects
- Posttraumatic stress disorder, antisocial personality disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, gambling disorder
- Cardiopulmonary problems common among individuals seeking treatment for cocaine-related issues; chest pain most common symptom.

##### Stimulant Intoxication

**Stimulant Intoxication**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **A.**: Recent use of an amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant
- **B.**: Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., euphoria or affective blunting; changes in sociability; hypervigilance; interpersonal sensitivity; anxiety, tension, or anger; stereotyped behaviors; impaired judgment) that developed during, or shortly after, use of a stimulant
- **C.**: Two (or more) of the following signs or symptoms, developing during, or shortly after, stimulant use:
  - Tachycardia or bradycardia
  - Pupillary dilation
  - Elevated or lowered blood pressure
  - Perspiration or chills
  - Nausea or vomiting
  - Evidence of weight loss
  - Psychomotor agitation or retardation
  - Muscular weakness, respiratory depression, chest pain, or cardiac arrhythmias
  - Confusion, seizures, dyskinesias, dystonias, or coma
- **D.**: The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., intoxication with another substance)

**Specifying the Intoxicant**:
- For amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant intoxication without perceptual disturbances:
  - If a mild use disorder is comorbid: ICD-10 code F15.129 (if no comorbid use disorder) or F15.929
  - If a moderate or severe use disorder is comorbid: ICD-10 code F15.229 (if no comorbid use disorder) or F15.829
- For amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant intoxication with perceptual disturbances:
  - If a mild use disorder is comorbid: ICD-10 code F15.122 (if no comorbid use disorder) or F15.922
  - If a moderate or severe use disorder is comorbid: ICD-10 code F15.222 (if no comorbid use disorder) or F15.822

**Associated Features**:
- The behavioral and psychological changes are accompanied by physiological symptoms (e.g., tachycardia, pupillary dilation, blood pressure changes)
- Intoxication, whether acute or chronic, is often associated with impaired social or occupational functioning
- Severe intoxication can lead to convulsions, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperpyrexia, and death

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Stimulant intoxication is distinguished from other stimulant-induced disorders (e.g., depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder) by the severity of the intoxication symptoms
- Stimulant intoxication delirium would be distinguished by a disturbance in level of awareness and change in cognition
- Salient mental disturbances associated with stimulant intoxication should be distinguished from symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depressive disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder

##### Stimulant Withdrawal

**Amphetamine/Stimulant Withdrawal**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:

- Specify if in early remission, sustained remission, on maintenance therapy, or in a controlled environment
- Code based on current severity: Mild (2-3 symptoms), Moderate (4-5 symptoms), Severe (6+ symptoms)

**Associated Features**:
- Smoking within 30 minutes of waking, daily smoking, smoking more cigarettes per day, and waking at night to smoke are associated with tobacco use disorder
- Environmental cues can evoke craving and withdrawal
- Serious medical conditions, such as lung and other cancers, cardiac and pulmonary disease, perinatal problems, cough, shortness of breath, and accelerated skin aging, often occur in individuals with tobacco use disorder

###### Prevalence Cigarettes

**Tobacco Use and Nicotine Dependence**

**Prevalence of Tobacco Use**
- Cigarettes are most common tobacco product, representing over 90% use
- In the U.S.:
  - 57% never smokers
  - 22% former smokers
  - 21% current smokers
- Approx. 20% of U.S. smokers are nondaily
- Prevalence of tobacco use in pipes and cigars is less than 1%
- DSM-IV nicotine dependence criteria can estimate prevalence, but it's a subset and therefore higher
- 13% 12-month prevalence of DSM-IV nicotine dependence among U.S. adults

**Prevalence of Nicotine Dependence by Demographic Characteristics**
- Higher in Native American and Alaska Natives (23%) than whites (14%)
- Less in African Americans (10%), Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders (6%), Hispanics (6%)
- Greater among daily smokers (approx. 50%) than non-daily smokers

**Development and Course of Tobacco Use Disorder**
- Majority of U.S. adolescents experiment with tobacco use by age 18, about 20% become daily users
- Initiation rare after age 21
- Many individuals attempt to quit but relapse, only one-half remain abstinent for life
- Most who use tobacco make multiple attempts to quit
- Individuals who use tobacco usually quit by age 30
- Non-daily smoking becoming more prevalent in younger individuals

**Risk and Prognostic Factors for Tobacco Use Disorder**

**Temperamental:**
- Externalizing personality traits increase likelihood of initiating tobacco use
- Children with ADHD or conduct disorder, adults with depressive, bipolar, anxiety, personality disorders at higher risk

**Environmental:**
- Low income and low educational levels associated with increased risk of initiation and decreased cessation

**Genetic and Physiological:**
- Genetic factors contribute to onset, continuation, and development of tobacco use disorder (50% heritability)
- Some risk specific to tobacco, some common to any substance use disorder

**Cultural Differences:**
- Prevalence declining in the U.S. since 1960s but less evident in African American and Hispanic populations
- Smoking more prevalent in developing countries than developed nations
- Cultural differences may be income, education, or tobacco control activity-related

**Diagnostic Markers:**
- Carbon monoxide, nicotine, and cotinine in breath, blood, saliva, or urine can measure current use but not disorder

**Functional Consequences of Tobacco Use Disorder**
- Medical consequences begin around age 40 and worsen over time
- One-half of smokers who don't quit will die early from tobacco-related illnesses
- Smoking causes cardiovascular issues, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancers, perinatal problems
- Long-term use of nicotine medications does not appear to cause medical harm
- Secondhand smoke increases risk of heart disease and cancer by 30%

**Comorbidities:**
- Most common medical conditions: cardiovascular illnesses, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancers
- Most common psychiatric comorbidities: alcohol/substance disorders, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, personality disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder
- Nicotine-dependent smokers 2.7-8.1 times more likely to have these disorders than others.

##### Tobacco Withdrawal

**Tobacco Withdrawal Criteria (ICD-9: 292.0, ICD-10: F17.203)**

A. **Daily use of tobacco for several weeks**
B. Abrupt cessation or reduction in tobacco use within 24 hours, followed by:
   1. Irritability, frustration, or anger
   2. Anxiety
   3. Difficulty concentrating
   4. Increased appetite
   5. Restlessness
   6. Depressed mood
   7. Insomnia
C. **Signs or symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning**
D. Symptoms not attributed to another medical condition or better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance

**Diagnostic Features**
- Tobacco withdrawal impairs ability to stop tobacco use
- Symptoms due to nicotine deprivation
- Intensity of symptoms varies based on type of tobacco used (cigarettes vs. nicotine medications)
- Common among daily tobacco users, can also occur in nondaily users
- Heart rate decreases, weight increases after stopping smoking
- Can produce clinically significant mood changes and functional impairment

**Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis**
- Craving for sweet or sugary foods, impaired performance on tasks requiring vigilance
- Increased constipation, coughing, dizziness, dreaming/nightmares, nausea, sore throat (after abstinence)
- Smoking increases metabolism of certain mental disorder medications, leading to increased blood levels and potential adverse effects

**Prevalence**
- Approximately 50% of tobacco users who quit for 2 or more days experience withdrawal symptoms
- Most commonly endorsed signs and symptoms: anxiety, irritability, difficulty concentrating
- Least commonly endorsed symptoms: depression, insomnia

**Development and Course**
- Begins within 24 hours of stopping or cutting down on tobacco use
- Peaks at 2-3 days after abstinence
- Lasts 2-3 weeks for most individuals
- Can occur among adolescent tobacco users before daily use
- Prolonged symptoms beyond 1 month are uncommon

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**
- Temperamental: smokers with depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, other substance use disorders have more severe withdrawal
- Genetic and physiological factors influence probability of withdrawal upon abstinence

**Diagnostic Markers**
- Carbon monoxide in breath, nicotine and cotinine in blood, saliva or urine only weakly related to tobacco withdrawal
- Abstinence from cigarettes can cause clinically significant distress
- Withdrawal impairs ability to stop or control tobacco use

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Overlaps with other substance withdrawal syndromes, caffeine intoxication, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, sleep disorders, medication-induced akathisia.
- Admission to smoke-free inpatient units or voluntary smoking cessation can induce withdrawal symptoms that mimic, intensify, or disguise other disorders or adverse effects of medications used to treat mental disorders.
- Reduction in symptoms with the use of nicotine medications confirms diagnosis.

##### Other Tobacco-Induced Disorders

**Tobacco-Induced Disorders**

**Tobacco-Induced Sleep Disorder**: Discussed in "Sleep-Wake Disorders" chapter ("Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder")

- Specify remission: early or sustained
- Specify if in a controlled environment

**Coding:**
- Use disorder codes based on current severity (305.90 for mild, 304.90 for moderate, and severe)
- For comorbid other (or unknown) substance use disorder and another mental disorder, use the code for the substance-induced mental disorder with the appropriate fourth character (refer to coding notes for intoxication, withdrawal, or specific substance-induced mental disorders)

**Associated Features:**
- Substance-related disorders not related to alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; hallucinogens; inhalants; opioids; sedative/hypnotics; stimulants or tobacco
- Unknown substance-related disorders involve unidentified substances, such as intoxications with unknown drugs or substance use disorders involving new, black market drugs or familiar ones illegally sold under false names
- Other (or unknown) substance use disorder is a mental disorder characterized by repeated use of an other or unknown substance despite knowing it causes serious problems.

###### Diagnostic Considerations for Unknown Substance Use Disorders

**Prevalence of Other Substance Use Disorders:**
- Prevalence likely lower than known substance use disorders

**Development and Course:**
- No single pattern for other substance use disorders
- Unknown substances may be reclassified when identified

**Risk Factors:**
- Presence of any substance use disorder or personality disorders
- Early onset, childhood trauma, behavioral disinhibition
- Easy availability in individual's environment

**Culture and Diagnostic Considerations:**
- Certain cultures associated with specific substances
- Clinical tests may not identify unusual or new substances
- Use of other substances without disorder: many medical conditions can mimic symptoms.

**Diagnosis:**
1. Other substance use disorder co-occurring with various substance disorders
2. Differentiate from known disorders caused by other substances (e.g., delirium, neurocognitive disorders)
3. Comorbidity: often seen with adolescent conduct disorder and adult antisocial personality disorder, suicidal ideation, and attempts.
4. Substance use disorders commonly comorbid with one another.

##### Other (or Unknown) Substance Intoxication

**Other (or Unknown) Substance Intoxication**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- A. Development of a reversible substance-specific syndrome attributable to recent ingestion or exposure to an unknown or unlisted substance.
- B. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes due to the substance's effect on the central nervous system (e.g., impaired motor coordination, psychomotor agitation/retardation, euphoria, anxiety, belligerence, mood lability, cognitive impairment, impaired judgment, social withdrawal).
- C. Signs or symptoms not attributable to another medical condition or better explained by another mental disorder (including substance intoxications).

**Coding**:
- ICD-9-CM: 292.89
- ICD-10-CM: F19.129 (mild other/unknown substance use disorder comorbidity), F19.229 (moderate or severe other/unknown substance use disorder comorbidity), or F19.929 (no comorbidity)

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Diagnosis challenging due to unknown substance and conflict between criterion A and B
- Signs and symptoms may resolve within hours to a few days after use of the substance
- Permanent impairments possible in some cases (e.g., MPTP and parkinsonism)

**Functional Consequences**:
- Dysfunction at work, social indiscretions, problems in interpersonal relationships, failure to fulfill role obligations, traffic accidents, fighting, high-risk behaviors, substance or medication overdose
- Variation in consequences based on the particular substance

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Other/unknown substance use without intoxication diagnosis
- Substance intoxications/other substance/medication-induced disorders (toxicology screen, chemical testing)
- Other toxic, metabolic, traumatic, neoplastic, vascular, or infectious disorders impairing brain function and cognition
- Drug withdrawals vs. other substance intoxications

**Comorbidity**:
- Adolescent conduct disorder, adult antisocial personality disorder, and other substance use disorders tend to co-occur with other (or unknown) substance intoxication.

##### Other (or Unknown) Substance Withdrawal

**Other (or Unknown) Substance Withdrawal**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **Criterion A**: Cessation or reduction of heavy, prolonged substance use
- **Criterion B**: Development of a "substance-specific syndrome" shortly after cessation
- **Criterion C**: Symptoms cause clinically significant distress/impairment in social/occupational functioning
- **Criterion D**: Symptoms not attributable to another medical condition or mental disorder
- **Criterion E**: Substance cannot be classified under other substance categories (alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, etc.)

**Coding and Note**:
- ICD-9-CM code: 292.0
- ICD-10-CM code: F19.239 (indicates comorbid moderate/severe other substance use disorder)

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Clinically significant mental disorder developing after reducing or terminating substance dosing
- Difficulty diagnosing when the drug is unknown, as substance-specific syndrome may not be evident
- Criterion D requires ruling out other medical conditions, mental disorders, and withdrawals from familiar substances

**Prevalence**:
- Prevalence of other (or unknown) substance withdrawal is unknown

**Development and Course**:
- Withdrawal signs appear hours after termination of use, with variable onset/course depending on dose and elimination rate
- Peak severity may involve only moderate discomfort, while severe cases can be fatal
- Dysphoria often leads to relapse
- Symptoms gradually abate over days, weeks, or months

**Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues**:
- Culture-related issues vary with specific substance

**Functional Consequences**:
- Withdrawal from any substance can have serious consequences (physical, psychological, relational)

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Dose reduction without meeting withdrawal criteria
- Other substance/medication-induced disorders (toxicology screens, chemical testing may help)
- Distinguishing from other substance use disorder and related disorders
- Rule out neurological/other medical conditions that mimic withdrawals

**Comorbidity**:
- High likelihood of comorbid adolescent conduct disorder, adult antisocial personality disorder, and other substance use disorders.

### Neurocognitive Disorders

**Neurocognitive Disorders (NCDs)**
* Includes **delirium**, major NCO, mild NCO, and their etiological subtypes
* Begins with delirium
* Followed by syndromes of major NCO and mild NCO
* **Major or mild NCO subtypes**: Alzheimer's disease; vascular NCO; Lewy bodies; Parkinson's disease; frontotemporal NCO; traumatic brain injury; HIV infection; substance/medication-induced NCO; Huntington's disease; prion disease; another medical condition; multiple etiologies; unspecified NCO
* Category for acquired cognitive impairment, not developmental
* **Cognitive deficits** present in many mental disorders but only those with core cognitive features are included
* Impaired cognition not present since birth or early life
* Syndromes have underlying pathology and etiology that can be determined
* Diagnostic criteria developed in consultation with expert groups for each disease entity
* Potential utility of biomarkers discussed in diagnosis
* **Major neurocognitive disorder (NCD)** replaces "dementia"
* Also includes **mild neurocognitive disorder**
* Criteria provided for both syndromic entities and etiological subtypes
* Frequently coexist with one another, relationships may be characterized under "Differential Diagnosis," "Risk and Prognostic Factors," and "Co-morbidity"
* Term "dementia" retained for continuity but **neurocognitive disorder** preferred in some settings

- ICD-9-CM: Multiple separate codes reflecting specific delirium etiologies (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy, delirium due to hepatic failure)

###### Diagnostic Criteria for Delirium: Symptoms, Features, and Associated Characteristics

**Delirium**

**Course**:
- Lasts approximately 1 week in hospital settings
- Symptoms may persist after discharge from hospital
- Individuals may rapidly switch between hyperactive and hypoactive states
- Hyperactive state more common, associated with medication side effects and drug withdrawal
- Hypoactive state more frequent in older adults

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Disturbance of attention or awareness that cannot be better explained by a preexisting or evolving neurocognitive disorder (NCO)
- **Disturbance in Attention** (Criterion A): reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention, easily distracted by irrelevant stimuli
- **Disturbance in Awareness** (Criterion B): reduced orientation to environment or self, develops over short period of time, fluctuates during the day
- Etiology is a physiological consequence of an underlying medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal, medication use, or toxin exposure (Criteria C and E)
- Delirium often occurs in the context of an underlying NCO
- Accompanying change in at least one other area: memory and learning, disorientation, language alterations, perceptual distortion or motor disturbance (Criterion C)

**Perceptual Disturbances**:
- Misinterpretations, illusions, or hallucinations, typically visual but may occur in other modalities
- Range from simple and uniform to highly complex
- Normal attention/arousal, delirium, and coma are on a continuum; delirium should not be diagnosed in the context of coma (Criterion D)

**Associated Features**:
- Disturbance in sleep-wake cycle: daytime sleepiness, nighttime agitation, difficulty falling asleep, excessive daytime sleepiness, or wakefulness throughout the night, sometimes complete reversal of night-day cycle
- Emotional disturbances: anxiety, fear, depression, irritability, anger, euphoria, apathy, rapid and unpredictable shifts between emotional states, especially prevalent at night and in low-stimulation environments.

###### Delirium Prevalence, Diagnosis, and Differential Diagnosis

**Delirium Prevalence and Risk Factors**

**Prevalence**:
- Highest among hospitalized older individuals, varying depending on individual characteristics and detection method
- Low (1%-2%) in the community overall
  - Increases with age, up to 14% in those over 85 years old
- 10-30% in older adults presenting to emergency departments
- 14-24% when admitted to hospital
- 15-53% postoperatively in older individuals
- Up to 60-87% in nursing homes and post-acute care settings
- Up to 83% at end of life

**Progression and Mortality**:
- Delirium may progress to stupor, coma, seizures, or death
- High mortality among hospitalized individuals with delirium (up to 40%)

**Risk Factors**:
- **Environmental**: Functional impairment, immobility, falls, low activity, drugs/medications (especially alcohol and anticholinergics)
- **Genetic and physiological**: Major and mild NCDs, older age, greater susceptibility in infancy/childhood
- Increased risk of nursing home placement and functional decline

**Diagnostic Differentials**:
- Psychotic disorders, bipolar/depressive disorders with psychotic features
- Acute stress disorder, malingering/factitious disorder
- Other neurocognitive disorders (Alzheimer's, etc.)

**Diagnostic Coding**:

**Criteria A:**
- Evidence of modest cognitive decline from a previous level of performance
  - Complex attention
  - Executive function
  - Learning and memory
  - Language
  - Perceptual motor
  - Social cognition
- Concern of individual, knowledgeable informant, or clinician about decline in cognitive function
- Modest impairment in cognitive performance
  * Preferably documented by standardized neuropsychological testing or other quantified clinical assessment

**Criteria B:**
- Cognitive deficits do not interfere with capacity for independence in everyday activities (complex instrumental activities)
- Preservation of complex instrumental activities such as paying bills, managing medications
- Greater effort, compensatory strategies, or accommodation may be required

**Criteria C:**
- Cognitive deficits do not occur exclusively in the context of delirium

**Criteria D:**

**Specify:**
- Based on etiology: Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Lewy body disease, vascular disease, traumatic brain injury, substance/medication use, HIV infection, prion disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, another medical condition, multiple etiologies, or unspecified
- Coding note: Use 331.83 (G31.84) for certain etiological subtypes; do not code additional codes for presumed etiological medical conditions except for substance/medication use

**Subtypes:**
- Major and mild neurocognitive disorders based on known or presumed etiology, time course, characteristic domains affected, and associated symptoms
- For certain etiological subtypes, diagnosis depends substantially on presence of causative entity; for others, diagnosis is based on cognitive, behavioral, and functional symptoms
- Frequently managed by clinicians in multiple disciplines

**Behavioral features:**
- Psychotic symptoms: common in mild-to-moderate stage major NCDs (Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration); no disorganized speech or behavior compared to schizophrenia
  * Delusions: persecutory theme is prominent
  - Hallucinations: may occur in any modality; visual hallucinations more common in NCDs than depression, bipolar disorder, or psychotic disorders
- Mood disturbances including depression, anxiety, elation
  * Depression: common early in course of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease; elation more common in frontotemporal lobar degeneration
- Agitation: disruptive motor or vocal activity, often occurs with advanced stages of cognitive impairment across all NCDs
- Sleep disturbance: insomnia, hypersomnia, circadian rhythm disturbances
- Apathy: diminished motivation and decreased goal-directed behavior accompanied by decreased emotional responsiveness; may manifest early in course of NCOs
- Other behavioral symptoms: wandering, disinhibition, hyperphagia, hoarding

**Mild NCD:**
- Primarily subtyped based on known or presumed etiology/pathological entity
- Diffaration between syndromes without an independently recognized etiological entity is clearer at the major NCO level than mild NCO
- Clinically significant behavioral disturbances may be present.

###### Cognitive Impairment Assessment: Major and Mild NCO Criteria

**NCO (Neurocognitive Disorder) Diagnostic Features**

**Major vs. Mild NCO**:
- Major NCO corresponds to "dementia" as an alternative term
- Core feature: **Acquired cognitive decline in one or more domains** based on both:
  - Cognitive concern expressed by individual, informant, or clinician
  - Objective assessment below expected level or showing decline over time
- Exclusive focus on objective testing may lead to underdiagnosis or overdiagnosis
- Concern vs. complaint: **Cognitive concern** may need to be elicited with careful questioning

**Mild NCO**:
- Individual describes tasks as more difficult, requiring extra time or effort
- May not notice or view these symptoms as abnormal, especially in the elderly
- Difficulties represent changes rather than lifelong patterns
- Determine cognitive loss vs. motor/sensory limitations
- Neuropsychological testing critical, especially for major NCO

**Criterion B**:
- **Individual's level of independence in everyday functioning**
- Major NCO: Impairment interferes with independence, requiring assistance
- Mild NCO: Preserved independence, although there may be subtle interference or increased effort/time
- Distinction between major and mild NCO is arbitrary, exists on a continuum

**Associated Features**:
- Typically specific to etiological subtype (e.g., neuroleptic sensitivity in Lewy body disease)

###### Neurocognitive Disorders: Prevalence, Course, Risk Factors, and Functional Consequences

**Neurocognitive Disorders (NCOs)**

**Prevalence**:
- NCO varies widely by age and etiological subtype
- Prevalence estimates are more accurate for narrow age bands than broad categories
- For older populations, prevalence increases with age, especially in those over 65 years old
- **Dementia**: Approximately 1%-2% at age 65, up to 30% by age 85
- **Mild NCO** is sensitive to the definition of the disorder, particularly in community settings
- Estimates for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) range from 2% to 10% at age 65 and 5% to 25% by age 85

**Course**:
- Course varies across etiological subtypes, useful in Differential Diagnosis
- Some subtypes have specific onset and remain static (e.g., traumatic brain injury), others fluctuate over time
- NCOs due to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's have insiduous onset and gradual progression
- NCOs in childhood/adolescence may have broad repercussions for social and intellectual development

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**:
- Age is the strongest risk factor, as it increases the risk of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases
- Female gender is associated with higher prevalence of dementia, especially Alzheimer's
- Genetic and physiological factors also play a role
- Culture, occupation, and gender may affect awareness and concern about cognitive symptoms
- Diagnostic testing (e.g., neuropsychological assessments) is crucial for diagnosis, particularly at the mild level

###### Distinguishing Normal Cognition from Neurocognitive Disorders: Diagnostic Challenges and Comorbidities

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- **Normal cognition vs mild NCO**: Difficult to distinguish due to arbitrary boundaries; careful history taking and objective assessment are essential
- **Mild NCO vs major NCO**: Similar challenge as above, longitudinal evaluation with quantified assessments may help detect mild NCO
- **Delirium**: May be difficult to differentiate from mild or major NCO; careful assessment of attention and arousal is necessary
- **Major depressive disorder**: Distinguishing from mild NCO can be challenging; specific patterns of cognitive deficits can assist, e.g., consistent memory vs variable performance
- **Specific learning disorder and neurodevelopmental disorders**: Clarifying the individual's baseline status helps distinguish an NCO from these conditions

**Comorbidities:**
- **Delirium**: Common in older individuals, often the first notice of underlying NCO; careful history taking is crucial
- **Mixed NCOs**: Common in older individuals, many etiological entities increase with age
- **Neurodevelopmental disorders**: Often co-occur with NCO in younger individuals, especially after head injuries or other traumatic events.

##### Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to Alzheimer's

**Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder**

A. **Diagnostic Criteria:**
- The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder

B. **Clinical Features:**
- Insidious onset and gradual progression of impairment in one or more cognitive domains (two for major)
- Evidence of memory decline and other affected cognitive domains (e.g., learning, executive function)
- Steady, progressive decline without extended plateaus
- No evidence of mixed etiologies, such as cerebrovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, or other contributing conditions

C. **Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease:**
- Probable Alzheimer's disease: evidence of a causative genetic mutation OR typical clinical picture with no extended plateaus and absence of mixed etiologies
- Possible Alzheimer's disease: clear evidence of decline, progressive nature, and no evidence of mixed etiologies but no genetic mutation detected

D. **Excluding Other Conditions:**
- The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, other neurodegenerative diseases, substance effects, or systemic disorders

**Coding:**
- Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease: 294.11 (F02.81) for probable, 331.83 (G31.84) for possible
- Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease: 294.10 (F02.80) for probable, 331.9 (G31.9) for possible

**Supporting Features:**
- Behavioral and psychological manifestations in approximately 80% of major NCO cases, often more distressing than cognitive symptoms
- Depression, apathy at mild stage or mildest level of major NCO
- Psychotic features, irritability, agitation, combativeness, wandering with moderately severe major NCO
- Gait disturbance, dysphagia, incontinence, myoclonus, and seizures late in the illness.

**Prevalence of Dementia (Major NCO)**:
- Prevalence ranges from 5% to 10% in the seventh decade to at least 25% thereafter in high-income countries
- Approximately 7% of individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease are between ages 65 and 74, 53% are between 75 and 84, and 40% are 85 years and older
- Up to 90% of dementias may be attributable to Alzheimer's disease, depending on setting and diagnostic criteria
- Mild NCO due to Alzheimer's is likely a substantial fraction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)

**Development and Course**:
- Mild NCO due to Alzheimer's progresses gradually, sometimes with brief plateaus, through severe dementia to death
- Mean duration of survival after diagnosis is approximately 10 years, reflecting advanced age rather than disease course
- Late-stage individuals are eventually mute and bedbound, with death commonly resulting from aspiration
- In mild NCO, symptoms gradually increase over time until the threshold for major NCO is reached
- Onset of symptoms is usually in the eighth and ninth decades; early onset forms may be related to known causative mutations
- Symptoms do not differ markedly at different onset ages, but younger individuals are more likely to survive the full course while older have more comorbidities

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**:
- **Traumatic brain injury** increases risk for major or mild NCO due to Alzheimer's disease
- **Age** is the strongest risk factor, with genetic susceptibility polymorphism apolipoprotein E4 increasing risk and decreasing age at onset
- There are rare causative Alzheimer's disease genes, including in Down's syndrome (trisomy 21)
- Multiple vascular risk factors influence risk for Alzheimer's disease

**Cultural-Related Diagnostic Issues**:
- Detection of NCO may be more difficult in cultural and socioeconomic settings where memory loss is considered normal in old age
- Older adults with low educational levels face greater challenges in objective cognitive assessment

**Diagnostic Markers**:
- **Cortical atrophy**, amyloid-predominant neuritic plaques, and tau-predominant neurofibrillary tangles are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease
- Genetic testing for mutations in APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 genes is commercially available for early-onset cases with autosomal dominant inheritance
- **Apolipoprotein E4** cannot serve as a diagnostic marker, as it is only a risk factor
- **Amyloid-based diagnostic tests**, such as amyloid imaging on PET scans and reduced levels of amyloid beta-42 in CSF, may have diagnostic value
- Signs of neuronal injury, such as hippocampal and temporoparietal cortical atrophy, are less specific for Alzheimer's disease but provide evidence of neuronal damage

**Functional Consequences of Major or Mild Neurcognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease**:
- Prominence of memory loss can cause significant difficulties relatively early in the course
- Social cognition and procedural memory may be preserved for extended periods compared to other neurocognitive domains
- Distinctive core features differentiate major or mild NCO due to other neurodegenerative processes, vascular conditions, or concurrent medical illnesses

###### Comorbidities and Differential Diagnosis in NCO and Alzheimer's Disease

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Includes major depression
- Presence of depression may be associated with reduced daily functioning and poor concentration
- Improvement with treatment of depression useful in distinguishing from Alzheimer's disease (NCO)
- Comorbidity
  * Most individuals with Alzheimer's disease are elderly and have multiple medical conditions
  * Major or mild NCO due to Alzheimer's disease commonly co-occurs with cerebrovascular disease
  * When a comorbid condition contributes to the NCO in an individual with Alzheimer's disease, then **NCO due to multiple etiologies** should be diagnosed.

##### Major or Mild Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder

**Differentiation from Other Conditions**:
- Not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, substance effects, or other mental, neurological, or systemic disorders
- Probable frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder: genetic mutation or disproportionate frontal and/or temporal lobe involvement from neuroimaging evidence
- Possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder: no genetic mutation and no neuroimaging performed

**Coding**:
- Probable major frontotemporal lobar degeneration with behavioral disturbance: code 331.19 (G31.09) followed by 294.11 (F02.81)
- Probable major frontotemporal lobar degeneration without behavioral disturbance: code 331.19 (G31.09) followed by 294.10 (F02.80)
- Possible major frontotemporal lobar degeneration: code 331.9 (G31.9)
- Mild neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration: code 331.83 (G31.84)

**Associated Features**:
- Extrapyramidal features in some cases, with an overlap with progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration
- Muscle atrophy and weakness in a subset of individuals
- Visual hallucinations may develop.

###### Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder: Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis

**Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder (NCO)**

**Prevalence**:
- Major or mild frontotemporal NCO: 2-10 cases per 100,000 people
- Approximately 20%-25% of cases occur in individuals over 65 years old
- Frontotemporal NCO accounts for about 5% of all dementia cases in autopsy series

**Demographics**:
- Individuals with major or mild frontotemporal NCO commonly present in the sixth decade of life
- Age at onset varies from third to ninth decades
- Median survival: 6-11 years after symptom onset, 3-4 years after diagnosis
- Shorter and faster decline than typical Alzheimer's disease

**Risk Factors**:
- Genetic and physiological factors:
  - Approximately 40% have a family history of early-onset NCO
  - 10% show autosomal dominant inheritance pattern
  - Mutations in MAPT (tau), GRN, C90RF72 genes identified
  - Presence of motor neuron disease associated with more rapid deterioration

**Diagnostic Markers**:
- Structural imaging: atrophy in specific brain regions depending on variant type
  - Behavioral-variant: medial frontal and anterior temporal atrophy
  - Semantic language-variant: middle, inferior, and anterior temporal atrophy (left more affected)
  - Nonfluent language-variant: predominantly left posterior frontal-insular atrophy
  - Logopenic variant: predominantly left posterior parietal or perisylvian atrophy
  - Functional imaging: hypoperfusion and/or cortical hypometabolism in corresponding brain regions

**Functional Consequences**:
- Early age at onset affects work, family life

- Behavioral changes may lead to social issues, family disruption, and institutionalization

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Other neurocognitive disorders: Alzheimer's disease, Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, vascular NCO
  - Distinguished by characteristic features and history of onset
- Other neurological conditions: progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, motor neuron disease
  - Overlap clinically and pathologically with frontotemporal NCD
- Mental disorders and medical conditions: depression, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, treatable causes of cognitive impairment

##### Major or Mild Neurocog nitive Disorder with Lewy Bodies

**Neurocognitive Disorder with Lewy Bodies (NCDLB)**
- **Criteria for Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder with Lewy Bodies**:
    - The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
    - The disorder has an insidious onset and gradual progression.
    - The disorder meets a combination of core diagnostic features and suggestive diagnostic features for probable or possible NCDLB.
- **Probable Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder with Lewy Bodies**:
    - The individual has two core features, or one suggestive feature with one or more core features.
    - **Core Features**:
        - Fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in attention and alertness.
        - Recurrent visual hallucinations that are well-formed and detailed.
        - Spontaneous features of Parkinsonism, with onset subsequent to the development of cognitive decline.
    - **Suggestive Diagnostic Features**:
        - Meets criteria for rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.
        - Severe neuroleptic sensitivity.
- **Possible Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder with Lewy Bodies**:
    - The individual has only one core feature, or one or more suggestive features.
- **Coding Note**:
    - For probable major NCDLB with behavioral disturbance, code first 331.82 (G31.83) Lewy body disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) probable major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, with behavioral disturbance.
    - For probable major NCDLB without behavioral disturbance, code first 331.82 (G31.83) Lewy body disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) probable major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, without behavioral disturbance.
    - For possible major NCDLB, code 331.9 (G31.9) possible major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies.
    - Do not use the additional codes for Lewy body disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.
- For mild NCDLB, code 331.83 (G31.84).

**Diagnostic Features of NCDLB**:
- Includes:
    - Progressive cognitive impairment, with early changes in complex attention and executive function rather than learning and memory.
    - Recurrent complex visual hallucinations.
    - Symptoms that fluctuate in a pattern that can resemble a delirium, but with no adequate underlying cause.
    - Variable presentation of symptoms, reducing the likelihood of observing all symptoms during a brief clinical visit.
- **Core Features**:
    - Spontaneous Parkinsonism, which must begin after the onset of cognitive decline.
    - Distinguish from neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal signs.
    - Accurate diagnosis is essential for safe treatment planning, as up to 50% of individuals with NCDLB have severe sensitivity to neuroleptic drugs.
- **Associated Features**:
    - Repeated falls and syncope.
    - Autonomic dysfunction, such as orthostatic hypotension and urinary incontinence.
    - Auditory and other nonvisual hallucinations are common.
    - Systematized delusions, delusional misidentification, and depression.

###### Prevalence, Diagnosis and Functional Consequences of Dementia With Lewy Bodies

**Neurocognitive Disorder with Lewy Bodies (NCDLB)**

**Prevalence**:
- Range from 0.1% to 5% of the general elderly population
- 1.7% to 30.5% of all dementia cases
- Brain bank (autopsy) series: Lewy bodies present in 20%-35% of cases of dementia
- Male-to-female ratio is approximately 1.5:1

**Characteristics**:
- Gradually progressive disorder with insidious onset
- Often a prodromal history of confusional episodes (delirium) of acute onset, often precipitated by illness or surgery
- Distinction between NCDLB and major/mild NCO due to Parkinson's disease:
  - Cognitive decline manifests early in the course of illness in NCDLB, at least a year before motor symptoms
  - Disease course may be characterized by occasional plateaus but eventually progresses through severe dementia to death
  - Average duration of survival is 5-7 years
- Typical onset of symptoms is from sixth to ninth decades of life, with most cases having onset in mid-70s

**Risk Factors**:
- Familial aggregation may occur, but no family history in most cases
- Several risk genes identified, but genetic and physiological factors are not well understood

**Diagnostic Markers**:
- Underlying neurodegenerative disease is primarily a synucleinopathy due to alpha-synuclein misfolding and aggregation
- Cognitive testing beyond brief screening instrument may be necessary to define deficits clearly
- Associated condition REM sleep behavior disorder may be diagnosed through formal sleep study or identified by questioning patient/informant
- Neuroleptic sensitivity (challenge) not recommended as diagnostic marker, but raises suspicion of NCDLB if it occurs
- Diagnostically suggestive features include:
  - Low striatal dopamine transporter uptake on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) scan
  - Relative preservation of medial temporal structures on CT/MRI brain scan
  - Reduced striatal dopamine transporter uptake on SPECT/PET scan
  - Generalized low uptake on SPECT/PET perfusion scan with reduced occipital activity
  - Prominent slow-wave activity on electroencephalogram with temporal lobe transient waves

**Functional Consequences**:
- Individuals with NCDLB are more functionally impaired than would be expected for their cognitive deficits compared to individuals with Alzheimer's disease
- This is largely due to motor and autonomic impairments, which cause problems with toileting, transferring, and eating
- Sleep disorders and prominent psychiatric symptoms may also add to functional difficulties
- Quality of life is often significantly worse than in individuals with Alzheimer's disease

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- **Major/mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease (NCO)**: Key differentiating feature is the temporal sequence in which parkinsonism and NCO appear.
  - For NCO due to Parkinson's disease, cognitive decline should not reach major NCO level until at least 1 year after diagnosis of motor symptoms
  - Less than 1 year between onset of motor symptoms and cognitive decline indicates NCDLB
  - Timing and sequence of parkinsonism and mild NCO may be more difficult to determine
- **Comorbidity**: Lewy body pathology frequently coexists with Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disease, particularly in oldest age groups.

##### Major or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder

**Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder (NCD)**

**Criteria for Diagnosis:**
- **Major or minor neurocognitive disorder** (Criterion A)
- **Consistent with vascular etiology** (Criteria B and C)
  - Temporal relationship to cerebrovascular events
  - Complex attention, frontal-executive function affected
- Sufficient evidence of cerebrovascular disease
  - History, physical examination, neuroimaging
- Not better explained by another disorder

**Types of Vascular NCD:**
1. **Probable vascular NCD**: Neuroimaging evidence or documented cerebrovascular event
2. **Possible vascular NCD**: Clinical criteria met but no neuroimaging available

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Heterogeneous presentation due to various types and locations of vascular lesions
- Cognitive deficits attributed to disruption of cortical-subcortical circuits
- Complex attention, executive function affected
- Gradual onset with slow progression: small vessel disease leading to white matter lesions
  - May be punctuated by acute events leaving subtle neurological deficits
- Assessing for presence of cerebrovascular disease relies on history, physical exam, neuroimaging

**Symptoms:**
- Documented history of stroke or transient ischemic episodes
- Neurological signs indicative of brain infarction
  - Hemiparesis, pseudobulbar syndrome, visual field defects
- Personality and mood changes
- Abulia, depression, emotional lability
- Late onset depressive symptoms accompanied by psychomotor slowing and executive dysfunction (vascular depression)

**Coding:**
- Probable major vascular NCD: F01.51 or F01.50 without behavioral disturbance
- Possible major vascular NCD: G31.9 with or without behavioral disturbance
- Mild vascular NCD: G31.84 (no additional code for cerebrovascular disease needed)

**Important Notes:**
- Diagnostic accuracy can be impacted by the lack of neuroimaging, which may over­ look "silent" brain infarctions and white matter lesions.
- Temporal association with documented strokes allows probable diagnosis in absence of neuimaging.

###### Vascular Dementia: Prevalence, Risk Factors, Diagnosis, and Differential Diagnosis

**Prevalence of Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder (NCD)**

**Major or Mild Vascular NCD**:
- Second most common cause of NCD after Alzheimer's disease
- In the US:
  - Prevalence ranges from 0.2% in 65-70 year olds to 16% in individuals over 80 years old
  - 20-30% diagnosed with dementia within 3 months of stroke onset
- Neuropathology series:
  - Prevalence increases from 13% at age 70 to 44.6% in those aged 90 or older
  - Compared to Alzheimer's (23.6-51%) and combined vascular dementia/Alzheimer's (2-46.4%)
- Higher prevalence in African Americans compared to Caucasians, and East Asian countries like Japan and China
- More common in males than females

**Course of Vascular NCD**:
- Can occur at any age, with prevalence increasing exponentially after 65 years old
- Course may vary from acute onset with partial improvement to stepwise decline, with fluctuations and plateaus
- Pure subcortical vascular NCD can have a slowly progressive course similar to Alzheimer's

**Risk Factors for Vascular NCD**:
- **Environmental factors**: Neuroplasticity modifiers like education, exercise, and mental activity
- **Genetic/physiological factors**: Same as cerebrovascular disease: hypertension, diabetes, smoking, obesity, high cholesterol/homocysteine, atherosclerosis/arteriolosclerosis risk factors, atrial fibrillation, and other embolism risks
- **Cerebral amyloid angiopathy**: Amyloid deposits in arterial vessels
- **Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CAOASIL)**

**Diagnostic Markers for Vascular NCD**:
- Structural neuroimaging (MRI/CT) has a role in diagnosis
- No other established biomarkers

**Clinical Presentation of Vascular NCD**:
- Associated with physical deficits causing additional disability
- **Differential Diagnosis**: Other neurocognitive disorders, especially Alzheimer's disease
- Consider other etiologies if incidental brain infarctions/white matter lesions are present
- Distinguished from other conditions (e.g., Lewy bodies, frontotemporal NCD) by specific features
- Not diagnosed if other diseases (e.g., tumors, multiple sclerosis) account for the cognitive impairment
- Inappropriate if symptoms can be entirely attributed to delirium, though both may occur together
- If major depressive disorder is present, diagnosis depends on temporal relationship and severity
- Major or mild vascular NCD commonly co-occurs with Alzheimer's disease
- Frequently co-occurs with depression, but diagnosis depends on temporal relationship and severity

##### Major/Mild Neurocognitive Disorder from Traumatic Brain Injury

**Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)**

**Criteria:**
- Criteria A: Major or mild neurocognitive disorder is met.
- Criteria B: Evidence of traumatic brain injury, such as impact to the head or other mechanisms of rapid movement or displacement of the brain within the skull, with one or more of the following:
  * Loss of consciousness
  * Posttraumatic amnesia
  * Disorientation and confusion
  - Neurological signs (e.g., neuroimaging demonstrating injury; new onset or worsening of seizures; visual field cuts; anosmia; hemiparesis)
- Criteria C: The neurocognitive disorder presents immediately after the occurrence of traumatic brain injury or immediately after recovery of consciousness and persists past the acute post-injury period.

**Coding:**
- ICD-9-CM: 294.10/294.11 (major neurocognitive disorder due to TBI, with/without behavioral disturbance)
- ICD-10-CM: F02.80/F02.81 (major neurocognitive disorder due to TBI, without/with behavioral disturbance)

**Features:**
- Difficulties in complex attention, executive ability, learning, and memory
- Slowing in speed of information processing
- Disturbances in social cognition
- Possible additional deficits with severe TBI (aphasia, neglect, constructional dyspraxia)
- Emotional disturbances (irritability, easy frustration, tension, anxiety, affective lability)
- Personality changes (disinhibition, apathy, suspiciousness, aggression)
- Physical disturbances (headache, fatigue, sleep disorders, vertigo or dizziness, tinnitus or hyperacusis, photosensitivity, anosmia)
- Neurological symptoms and signs (seizures, hemiparesis, visual disturbances, cranial nerve deficits)
- Evidence of orthopedic injuries

**Prevalence:**
- 1.7 million TBIs occur annually in the United States
- Resulting in 1.4 million emergency department visits, 275,000 hospitalizations, and 52,000 deaths
- About 2% of the population lives with TBI-associated disability
- Males account for 59% of TBIs in the United States

**Etiologies:**
- Falls are the most common cause of TBI
- Vehicular accidents and being struck on the head are also sources
- Contact sports, particularly football, have been identified as sources of mild TBI with potential for cumulative effects

**Development and Course:**
- Severity ratings for traumatic brain injury: Mild, Moderate, Severe (Glasgow Coma Scale Score)
- Neurocognitive symptoms tend to resolve within days to weeks after mild TBI with complete resolution typical by 3 months
- Repeated mild TBI may be associated with persisting neurocognitive disturbance
- With moderate and severe TBI, there may be associated neurophysiological, emotional, and behavioral complications such as seizures, photosensitivity, hyperacusis, irritability, aggression, depression, sleep disturbance, fatigue, apathy, and deterioration in interpersonal relationships
- Older age (over 40 years) and initial clinical parameters (Glasgow Coma Scale score, motor function, pupillary nonreactivity, CT evidence of brain injury) are associated with worse outcomes.

##### Substance/Medication-Induced Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

**Diagnostic Criteria**

A. **The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder.**
- Neurocognitive impairments persist beyond usual duration of intoxication and acute withdrawal (Criterion B)
  - Initially reflect slow recovery from prolonged substance use
  - Improvements in neurocognitive and brain imaging indicators may be seen over months if disorder continues for extended period, specify persistent
- Given substance and its use known to cause observed impairments (Criterion C)
  - Specific patterns of cognitive impairments can occur with selected drug classes
    - Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drugs: greater disturbances in memory than other functions
    - Alcohol: combination of impairments in executive function and memory/learning domains
  - Temporal course consistent with substance use (Criterion D)
- In alcohol-induced amnesiac confabulatory (Korsakoff's) NCO: prominent amnesia, severe difficulty learning new information, rapid forgetting, confabulation, may co-occur with signs of thiamine encephalopathy like nystagmus and ataxia
  - Ophthalmoplegia of Wernicke's encephalopathy: lateral gaze paralysis
- Methamphetamine use can also be associated with vascular injury, e.g., focal weakness, unilateral incoordination, asymmetrical reflexes

B. **Criteria for Substance/Medication-Induced Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (Continued)**
- Supporting symptoms: increased irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbance, dysphoria in intermediate-duration NCO induced by central nervous system depressant drugs
- Rebound depression, hypersomnia, apathy in severe forms of substance/medication-induced major NCO.

**Recording Procedures for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM:**
- Substance or medication-induced neurocognitive disorder begins with specific substance presumed to cause symptoms
- Diagnostic code selected based on drug class and presence/absence of comorbid substance use disorder
  - For unknown substance, use "other substance" or "unknown substance" category
- Name of disorder followed by type (if applicable) and duration specification (persistent)
  - Example: alcohol-induced major neurocognitive disorder, amnestic-confabulatory type, persistent.
- Separate diagnosis for substance use disorder given if no comorbid substance use disorder present.

**Behavioral Disturbance:** Cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.

###### Substance-Induced Neurocognitive Disorders: Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Diagnostic Considerations

**Prevalence of Substance/Medication-Induced NCDs:**
- Prevalence unknown for all types
- Older individuals, longer use, risk factors like nutritional deficits increase likelihood
  * Alcohol abuse: approximately 30%-40% mild NCO in first two months of abstinence
    **Major NCO rare and may result from concomitant nutritional deficiencies**
  * Substances like cocaine, methamphetamine, opioids, phencyclidine, sedatives, or anxiolytics: one-third or more with substance/medication-induced mild NCO of intermediate duration
    **Major NCO rare for these substances**
  * Methamphetamine use may also cause cerebrovascular disease and brain injury
  * Solvent exposure linked to both major and mild NCO of both intermediate and persistent duration
- Cannabis and hallucinogens: intoxication may cause neurocognitive disturbances clearing upon abstinence; relationship with persistent NCO controversial

**Development and Course:**
- Substance use disorders commonly commence during adolescence, peak in 20s and 30s
- Longer history of severe substance use disorder associated with greater likelihood of NCO, but recovery common among individuals achieving stable abstinence before age 50
- Substance/medication-induced major or mild NCO most likely to become persistent in individuals who continue abuse past age 50
- Earlier commencement of alcohol abuse may lead to defects in later neural development affecting social cognition and other neurocognitive abilities
- Additive effect of aging and alcohol-induced brain injury possible

**Risk Factors:**
- Older age, longer use, persistent use past age 50
- Long-term nutritional deficiencies, liver disease, vascular risk factors, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (alcohol-induced NCO)
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals cortical thinning, white matter loss, enlargement of sulci and ventricles; neuroimaging abnormalities do not always correlate with NCO presence or severity
- Specialized techniques and magnetic resonance spectroscopy can help identify specific damage to white matter tracts or markers of inflammation or white matter injury.

**Functional Consequences:**
- Substance/medication-induced mild NCO may have associated motor syndromes increasing functional impairment
- Augmented cognitive inefficiency and difficulty concentrating beyond that seen in other NCDs possible

**Different Diagnosis:**
- Differentiation from neurocognitive disturbances arising outside the context of substance use, intoxication, and withdrawal essential
- Comorbid conditions like traumatic brain injury, infections (HIV, hepatitis C virus, syphilis) may contribute to neurocognitive impairment

**Comorbidity:**
- High comorbidity with other mental disorders: posttraumatic stress disorder, psychotic disorders, depressive and bipolar disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders
- Severe, long-term alcohol use disorder associated with major organ system disease like cerebrovascular disease and cirrhosis.

##### Major or Mild Neur ocog nitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection

**Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection**

A. **Criteria**
- Documented infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
- Neurocognitive disorder not better explained by non-HIV conditions, including secondary brain diseases or cryptococcal meningitis
- Not attributable to another medical condition or mental disorder

B. **HIV Infection**
- Caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)
- Acquired through exposure to bodily fluids of an infected person via injection drug use, unprotected sexual contact, or accidental/iatrogenic exposure
- Affects immune cells, leading to severe depletion of T-helper lymphocytes and immunocompromise
- Diagnosed using established laboratory methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV antibody with Western blot confirmation and/or polymerase chain reaction-based assays for HIV

C. **Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection**
- Subcortical pattern with impaired executive function, slowing of processing speed, problems with attentional tasks, difficulty learning new information but fewer problems with recall of learned information
- Can resolve, improve, slowly worsen, or have a fluctuating course
- Prevalence in HIV-infected individuals: approximately one-third to over one-half have at least mild neurocognitive disturbance; 25% meet criteria for mild NCO; fewer than 5% meet criteria for major NCO
- Risk factors for NCO due to HIV infection: severe immunosuppression, high viral loads in cerebrospinal fluid, advanced HIV disease such as anemia and hypoalbuminemia, neurodevelopmental delay in infants/children
- Associated features: neuromotor difficulties (severe coordination, ataxia, motor slowing), loss of emotional control (aggressive or inappropriate affect, apathy)
- Progression of disorder follows a "subcortical" pattern, affecting any part of the brain; considerable heterogeneity in overall course depending on associated comorbidities and consequences of HIV
- NCO due to HIV infection can interact with age over life course, especially in older adults

D. **Differential Diagnosis**
- In presence of comorbidities (other infections, drug abuse, prior head injury, neurodevelopmental conditions), major or mild NCO due to HIV infection can be diagnosed if evidence shows that HIV has worsened preexisting/comorbid conditions
- Differentiate from neurocognitive decline related to cerebrovascular disease or neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease by considering stability, fluctuation, or improvement vs. steady or stepwise deterioration; HIV etiology favors stable, fluctuating, or improving neurocognitive status
- Sudden onset or worsening of NCO demands investigation for non-HIV etiologies such as opportunistic infections and neoplasms

E. **Comorbidities and Prognostic Factors**
- Chronic systemic and neuroinflammation associated with cerebrovascular disease and metabolic syndrome, complications of HIV disease
- Co-occurrence of conditions such as substance use disorders, other sexually transmitted disorders
- Risk factors for NCO due to HIV infection: inadequate control of HIV in the central nervous system, evolution of drug-resistant viral strains, effects of chronic long-term systemic and brain inflammation, effects of comorbid factors such as aging, drug abuse, past history of CNS trauma, and co-infections like hepatitis C virus
- Possibility of neurotoxicity from antiretroviral drugs although not definitively established.

##### Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Prion Disease

**Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Prion Disease (Prion Dementia)**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- Major or mild neurocognitive disorder is present

- Neurocognitive disorder not attributable to another medical condition or mental disorder

**Coding**:
- Major neurocognitive disorder due to prion disease: 046.79 (A81.9) followed by 294.11 (F02.81) for behavioral disturbance; 294.10 (F02.80) without behavioral disturbance
- Mild neurocognitive disorder due to prion disease: 331.83 (G31.84)

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Includes subacute spongiform encephalopathies, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, kuru, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, and fatal insomnia
- Commonly presents with neurocognitive deficits, ataxia, abnormal movements, startle reflex
- Rapid progression to major NCD over 6 months or less
- May have atypical presentations, only diagnosed by biopsy or autopsy
- Individuals with variant CJD may exhibit greater preponderance of psychiatric symptoms (low mood, withdrawal, anxiety)
- Diagnosis requires characteristic biomarker features: OWI/FLAIR lesions, tau or 14-3-3 protein in cerebrospinal fluid, triphasic waves on EEG, family history or genetic testing

**Prevalence**:
- Annual incidence of sporadic CJD is approximately one or two cases per million people
- Prevalence is very low due to short survival

**Development and Course**:
- Can develop at any age in adults, with a peak age around 67 years
- Prodromal symptoms may include fatigue, anxiety, appetite/sleeping problems, concentration difficulties
- Followed by incoordination, altered vision, abnormal gait or movements, rapidly progressive dementia
- Progresses very rapidly to major level over several months; more rarely, can progress over 2 years like other NCDs

**Risk Factors and Prognosis**:
- Environmental: cross-species transmission, corneal transplantation, human growth factor injection, anecdotal cases in healthcare workers
- Genetic component in up to 15% of cases associated with autosomal dominant mutation

**Diagnostic Markers**:
- Prion disease can only be definitively confirmed by biopsy or at autopsy
- Reliable biomarkers are being developed, including 14-3-3 protein (for sporadic CJD) and tau protein
- Magnetic resonance imaging is most sensitive when diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is performed
- EEG may reveal periodic sharp, often triphasic and synchronous discharges at 0.5-2 Hz

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Other major neurocognitive disorders may appear similar in course but can be distinguished by their rapid progression and prominent cerebellar/motor symptoms.

   * Established Parkinson’s disease precedes onset of NCO
   * No evidence of another disorder contributing to cognitive decline
2. Major neurocognitive disorder possibly due to Parkinson's disease (G31.9)
   * Either no evidence of another disorder or the Parkinson’s disease clearly precedes NCO onset
3. Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease (G31.84)
4. Major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies (distinguished by timing and sequence of motor and cognitive symptoms)
5. Major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease
   * Distinctive motor features help differentiate from Parkinson's disease NCO
6. Vascular neurocognitive disorder with parkinsonian features
7. Neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition (e.g., neurodegenerative disorders, tumors)
8. Neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism
9. Other medical conditions or side effects of medications (delirium, severe hypothyroidism, B12 deficiency)

**Features Supporting Diagnosis:**
- Apathy
- Depressed mood
- Anxious mood
- Hallucinations
- Delusions
- Personality changes
- Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder
- Excessive daytime sleepiness

**Prevalence:**
- Prevalence of Parkinson’s disease in the US: 0.5% (ages 65-69) to 3% (age 85 and older)
- More common in males than females
- Up to 75% of individuals with Parkinson's disease develop major NCO
- Prevalence of mild NCO in Parkinson's disease: 27%

**Development and Course:**
- Typical onset between sixth and ninth decades of life
- Mild NCO often develops relatively early, major impairment late

**Risk Factors:**
- Exposure to herbicides and pesticides
- Older age at disease onset
- Increasing duration of disease

**Diagnostic Markers:**
- Neuropsychological testing for core cognitive deficits, particularly in mild NCO phase
- Structural neuroimaging (e.g., OAT scans) to differentiate Lewy body dementias from non-Lewy body-related dementias and evaluate major or mild NCO due to Parkinson's disease.

##### Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease

**Criteria for Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease:**
- The following criteria must be met:
  - Criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder
  - Insidious onset and gradual progression
  - Clinically established Huntington's disease or risk based on family history or genetic testing
  - Neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical condition and cannot be better explained by another mental disorder

**Coding:**
- For major neurocognitive disorder with behavioral disturbance, code: 333.4 (G10) Huntington's disease followed by 294.11 (F02.81)
- For major neurocognitive disorder without behavioral disturbance, code: 333.4 (G10) Huntington's disease followed by 294.10 (F02.80)
- For mild neurocognitive disorder, code: 331.83 (G31.84)

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Progressive cognitive impairment is a core feature of Huntington's disease
- Early changes in executive function (processing speed, organization, planning) rather than learning and memory
- Cognitive and behavioral changes may precede motor symptoms
- Diagnosis of definite Huntington's disease requires unequivocal extrapyramidal motor abnormalities or family history/genetic testing
- Associated features: depression, irritability, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, apathy, and psychosis (rarely) may precede onset of motor symptoms

**Prevalence:**
- Worldwide prevalence is 2.7 per 100,000
- Higher prevalence in North America, Europe, and Australia (5.7 per 100,000) vs. much lower in Asia (0.40 per 100,000)

**Development and Course:**
- Average age at diagnosis is approximately 40 years, with wide variability
- Age at onset inversely correlated with CAG expansion length
- Juvenile Huntington's disease may present differently than adult-onset disorder
- Disease is gradually progressive with median survival of 15 years after motor symptom diagnosis
- Psychiatric and cognitive abnormalities can precede motor symptoms by at least 15 years

**Genetic Basis:**
- Autosomal dominant expansion of the CAG trinucleotide in the huntingtin gene on chromosome 4
- Diagnosis made after symptoms manifest, not solely based on genetic testing
- Genetic testing primary diagnostic tool with neuroimaging changes (volume loss in basal ganglia) also observed

**Functional Consequences:**
- Occupational decline early in illness due to emotional, behavioral, and cognitive symptoms
- Disinhibition and personality changes highly associated with functional decline
- Speed of processing, initiation, and attention most contributing cognitive deficits rather than memory impairment
- Huntington's disease may have disruptive effects on work performance and social life as it progresses
- Severe choreic movements can interfere with care provision, adding to level of impairment and daily care needs.

##### Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition

**Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**

**Criteria**:
- Criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder
- Evidence from history, physical exam, or lab findings shows the neurocognitive disorder is a pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition
- Cognitive deficits not better explained by another mental disorder or specific neurocognitive disorder (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, HIV infection)

**Coding**:
- For major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition with behavioral disturbance: code the other medical condition first, followed by the major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition with behavioral disturbance (e.g., 340 [G35] multiple sclerosis, 294.11 [F02.81])
- For major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition without behavioral disturbance: code the other medical condition first, followed by the major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition without behavioral disturbance (e.g., 340 [G35], 294.10 [F02.80])
- For mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition: code 331.83 (G31.84)
- Do not use the additional code for the other medical condition, as behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing

**Diagnostic Features**:
- A number of other medical conditions can cause neurocognitive disorders (NCDs)
- These conditions include structural lesions (e.g., primary or secondary brain tumors), hypoxia related to heart failure, endocrine conditions (e.g., hypothyroidism), nutritional conditions (e.g., thiamine deficiency), other infectious conditions (e.g., neurosyphilis), immune disorders (e.g., temporal arteritis), hepatic or renal failure, metabolic conditions (e.g., Kufs' disease), and other neurological conditions (e.g., epilepsy)
- Temporal association between onset/exacerbation of the medical condition and development of cognitive deficits provides greatest support that NCD is induced by the medical condition
- Diagnostic certainty can be increased if neurocognitive deficits ameliorate or stabilize with treatment of the medical condition

**Course**:
- Course of NCD progresses in a manner commensurate with the course of the underlying medical disorder
- If the medical disorder is treatable (e.g., hypothyroidism), the neurocognitive deficit may improve or not progress
- When the medical condition has a deteriorative course (e.g., secondary progressive multiple sclerosis), neurocognitive deficits will progress along with the temporal course of illness

**Diagnostic Markers**:
- Physical exam and lab findings, as well as other clinical features, depend on the nature and severity of the medical condition

##### Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Multiple Etiologies

**Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Multiple Etiologies**
* The criteria are met for **major or mild neurocognitive disorder**
* There is evidence that the neurocognitive disorder is the pathophysiological consequence of more than one etiological process, excluding substances (e.g., neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease with subsequent development of vascular neurocognitive disorder)
* The cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder and do not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium

**Coding notes:**
- For major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, with behavioral disturbance, code 294.11 (F02.81)
- For major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, without behavioral disturbance, code 294.10 (F02.80)
- All etiological medical conditions (except vascular disease) should be coded and listed separately before the major neurocognitive disorder diagnosis
- For a presentation of major neurocognitive disorder due to both Alzheimer's disease and vascular disease, with behavioral disturbance, code 331.0 (G30.9), 294.11 (F02.81), and 290.40 (F01.51)
- For mild neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, code 331.83 (G31.84)

**Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder**
* Symptoms characteristic of a neurocognitive disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class
* The precise etiology cannot be determined with sufficient certainty to make an etiological attribution

**Coding note:**
- For unspecified major or mild neurocognitive disorder, code 799.59 (R41.9)
- Do not use additional codes for any presumed etiological medical conditions or behavioral disturbance

**Definition**:
- Enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates from cultural expectations
- Pervasive and inflexible
- Onset in adolescence or early adulthood
- Stable over time
- Leads to distress or impairment

**Section II vs. III**:
- Section II: Update of text associated with DSM-IV-TR criteria
- Section III: Proposed research model for personality disorder diagnosis and conceptualization developed by the DSM-5 Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group

**Personality Disorders Included:**
1. Paranoid personality disorder
2. Schizoid personality disorder
3. Schizotypal personality disorder
4. Antisocial personality disorder

   - Not included in the DSM-5 classification (e.g., passive-aggressive personality disorder)

**Clusters**:
1. Cluster A (Paranoid, Schizoid, Schizotypal): Odd or eccentric behavior
2. Cluster B (Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, Narcissistic): Dramatic, emotional, or erratic behavior
3. Cluster C (Avoidant, Dependent, Obsessive-compulsive): Anxious or fearful appearance

**Limitations**:
- Clustering system has serious limitations and has not been consistently validated
- Individuals frequently present with co-occurring personality disorders from different clusters.

###### Personality Disorders: Categorical vs Dimensional Models for Diagnosis

**Prevalence Rates for Personality Disorders**
- **Cluster A (Disorders)**: 5.7% prevalence
- **Cluster B (Disorders)**: 1.5% prevalence
- **Cluster C (Disorders)**: 6.0% prevalence
- **Any Personality Disorder**: 9.1% prevalence
- Approximately 15% of U.S. adults have at least one personality disorder

**Dimensional Models for Personality Disorders**
- **Categorical Perspective**: Diagnostic approach representing personality disorders as qualitatively distinct clinical syndromes
- **Dimensional Perspective**: Personality disorders are maladaptive variants of personal traits that merge into normal and one another
- DSM-IV personality disorder clusters can be viewed as dimensions on a continuum with other mental disorders
- Alternative dimensional models cover important areas of personality dysfunction, clinical utility, integration, and relationship with diagnostic categories are under investigation.

#### General Personality Disorder

**Personality Disorder Diagnosis Criteria:**
* Enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior deviating from cultural expectations (Criteria A)
  * Cognition: ways of perceiving self, others, events
  * Affectivity: emotional response range, intensity, lability, appropriateness
  * Interpersonal functioning
  * Impulse control
* Inflexible and pervasive across various situations (Criterion B)
* Clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational functioning (Criterion C)
* Long duration since adolescence or early adulthood onset (Criterion D)
* Not better explained as another mental disorder manifestation (Criterion E)
* No attribution to physiological effects of substances or medical conditions (Criterion F)

**Personality Traits:**
- Enduring patterns of thinking, feeling, behaving that are relatively stable over time
- Some types may decrease with age (antisocial, borderline), others less so (obsessive-compulsive, schizotypal)
- Diagnosis in individuals under 18 requires features present for at least 1 year
- Exceptions: antisocial personality disorder cannot be diagnosed before age 18; onset must be no later than early adulthood

**Assessment:**
- Evaluate long-term patterns of functioning
- Distinguish from situational stressors or transient mental states
- Obtain information from other informants if necessary
- Consider cultural background in diagnosis process
- Assess stability over time and across situations
- Single interview may be sufficient but multiple interviews often needed

**Diagnostic Issues:**
- Gender differences: some disorders more common in males (antisocial), others in females (borderline, histrionic, dependent)
- Caution against overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis based on gender stereotypes
- Personality disorders vs. other mental disorders: difficult to distinguish from persistent disorders like depressive disorder
- Spectrum relationship with other mental disorders: schizotypal personality disorder with schizophrenia, avoidant personality disorder with social anxiety disorder
- Distinguish from personality traits that do not reach threshold for a personality disorder

**Exclusions:**
* Personality disorders cannot be diagnosed during episodes of psychotic disorders or other psychiatric conditions (paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal) unless it preceded them
* When an individual has a preexisting personality disorder followed by another mental disorder, both diagnoses should be recorded with "premorbid" in parentheses

**Other Considerations:**
- Careful diagnosis during episodes of anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, or PTSD
- Do not make a personality disorder diagnosis based solely on behaviors associated with substance use
- Consideration for personality change due to another medical condition when enduring changes in personality arise as a result of physiological effects.

#### Cluster A Personality Disorders

##### Paranoid Personality Disorder

4. Read hidden demeaning or threatening meanings into benign remarks or events
5. Persistently bears grudges (unforgiving of insults, injuries, or slights)
6. Perceives attacks on character/reputation that are not apparent to others
7. Quickly reacts angrily or counterattacks based on perceived threats
8. Recurrent suspicions about fidelity of spouse or sexual partner
9. Occurs not attributable to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression with psychotic features, or another psychotic disorder

###### "Paranoid Personality Disorder: Diagnosis, Differential Diagnosis, and Cultural Considerations"

**Prevalence of Paranoid Personality Disorder**
- Prevalence estimate from National Comorbidity Survey Replication: 2.3%
- Prevalence estimate from National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions: 4.4%

**Development and Course**
- Appears first in childhood/adolescence: solitariness, poor peer relationships, social anxiety, underachievement, hyper-sensitivity, peculiar thoughts and language, idiosyncratic fantasies
- Clinical samples show higher prevalence in males

**Risk Factors and Prognostic Issues**
- Increased risk in relatives of probands with schizophrenia
- Family relationship with delusional disorder, persecutory type
- Guarded or defensive behaviors in some ethnic groups may be misinterpreted as paranoid due to unfamiliarity or perceived neglect/indifference from the majority society

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Distinguish from: delusional disorder (persecutory type), schizophrenia, bipolar or depressive disorders with psychotic features
- Paranoid personality disorder must be present before onset of psychotic symptoms and persist during remission
- When another persistent mental disorder preceded by paranoid personality disorder, record both
- Distinguish from: personality change due to medical condition, substance use disorders, paranoid traits associated with physical handicaps
- Distinguish from other personality disorders (schizotypal, schizoid, borderline, histrionic, avoidant, antisocial, narcissistic) based on characteristic features
- Paranoid personality disorder diagnosed when traits are inflexible, maladaptive, persistent, and cause functional impairment or subjective distress.

##### Schizoid Personality Disorder

  - 3.1% from National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (2001-2002)

**Development:**
- May first appear in childhood or adolescence with solitariness, poor peer relationships, and underachievement in school
- Indivisuals from rural to metropolitan environments or immigrants may exhibit "emotional freezing" and be misdiagnosed as schizoid

**Risk Factors:**
- Genetic and physiological
- Increased prevalence in relatives of individuals with schizophrenia or schizotypal personality disorder

**Culture:**
- Defensive behaviors and interpersonal styles may be erroneously labeled as "schizoid" in certain cultural backgrounds
- Individuals from metropolitan environments or immigrants might react with solitude, affect constriction, and communication deficits

**Gender:**
- Slightly more common in males
- Can cause more impairment in them

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Distinguish from other mental disorders with psychotic symptoms: delusional disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar or depressive disorder with psychotic features
  - Schizoid personality disorder must have been present before onset and persist during remission
- Autism spectrum disorder: great difficulty differentiating based on social interaction and stereotyped behaviors/interests
- Personality change due to another medical condition, substance use disorders, other personality disorders, and traits
  - Distinguish based on characteristic features
- If individual has multiple personality disorders or traits, all can be diagnosed

##### Schizotypal Personality Disorder

**Schizotypal Personality Disorder (F21)**

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- **Pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits** marked by acute discomfort with, and reduced capacity for, close relationships.
- Evidence of cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentricities of behavior since early adulthood in various contexts (five or more symptoms):
  1. **Ideas of reference**: incorrect interpretations of casual incidents and external events.
  2. **Odd beliefs or magical thinking** affecting behavior, outside subcultural norms.
  3. **Unusual perceptual experiences**, including bodily illusions.
  4. **Odd thinking and speech**: vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, overelaborate, or stereotyped.
  5. **Suspiciousness or paranoid ideation**.
  6. **Inappropriate or constricted affect**.
  7. **Behavior or appearance that is odd, eccentric, or peculiar**.
  8. **Lack of close friends or confidants** other than first-degree relatives.
  9. **Excessive social anxiety** not diminishing with familiarity and associated with paranoid fears rather than negative judgments about self.
- Not occurring exclusively during schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depressive disorder with psychotic features, another psychotic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder. If criteria are met prior to schizophrenia onset, add "premorbid."

**Essential Features:**
- Pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by acute discomfort with close relationships and cognitive/perceptual distortions or eccentricities.
- Individuals often have ideas of reference (incorrect interpretations) and odd beliefs or magical thinking affecting behavior.
- Perceptual alterations may be present, such as sensing others or hearing voices.
- Speech is often loose, digressive, vague but not derailed; responses can be concrete or abstract.
- Suspiciousness and paranoid ideation are common.
- Affect range is restricted, interacting with others inappropriately or stiffly.
- Odd or eccentric behavior, mannerisms, unkempt appearance, and disregard for social conventions.
- Uncomfortable relating to others; decreased desire for intimate contacts; no/few close friends beyond first-degree relatives.

**Associated Features:**
- Individuals seek treatment for anxiety or depression symptoms rather than personality disorder features.
- Transient psychotic episodes may occur during stress, but usually insufficient for additional diagnosis.
- High risk of major depressive episode; up to 50% have concurrent MDD diagnosis.
- Co-occurrence with schizoid, paranoid, avoidant, and borderline personality disorders.

###### Prevalence and Characteristics of Schizotypal Personality Disorder

**Prevalence**
- Range of reported rates: 0.6% to 4.6%, depending on study
- Infrequent (0%-1.9%) in clinical populations
- Estimated prevalence in general population: 3.9%

**Course and Prognosis**
- Relatively stable course with small proportion developing schizophrenia or psychotic disorder
- May first appear in childhood/adolescence as solitariness, social anxiety, etc.

**Risk Factors (Genetic and Physiological)**
- Aggregates familiarly among individuals with schizophrenia families
- Modest increase of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders in relatives of probands with schizotypal personality disorder

**Diagnostic Considerations**
- Evaluate cognitive/perceptual distortions within individual's cultural milieu
  - Religious beliefs and rituals can appear schizotypal to uninformed outsider (voodoo, speaking in tongues, etc.)
- Slightly more common in males.

###### Distinguishing Schizotypal Personality Disorder from Other Mental Disorders

**Differential Diagnosis of Schizotypal Personality Disorder:**

**Distinguishing Features from Other Mental Disorders:**
- **Delusional disorder**: Persistent psychotic symptoms (delusions and hallucinations) differentiate this disorder from schizotypal personality disorder.
- **Schizophrenia**: Also characterized by persistent psychotic symptoms, with additional signs such as disorganized speech or behavior, which are not present in schizotypal personality disorder.
- **Bipolar disorder or depression with psychotic features**: Psychotic symptoms occur during mood episodes and remit once the episode is over, unlike schizotypal personality disorder where they persist.
- **Schizotypal personality disorder preceding these disorders**: If an individual has a pre-existing schizotypal personality disorder followed by a psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophrenia), both diagnoses should be recorded, with "premorbid" in parentheses for the schizotypal personality disorder.

**Distinguishing Schizotypal Personality Disorder from Neurodevelopmental Disorders:**
- Difficulty distinguishing children with schizotypal personality disorder from solitary, odd children: Marked social isolation, eccentricity, or peculiarities of language may be indicative of milder forms of autism spectrum disorder or language communication disorders.
- Differences in primary symptoms: Communication disorders have primacy and severity in language as distinguishing features; Milder forms of autism spectrum disorder show greater lack of social awareness and emotional reciprocity, stereotyped behaviors, and interests than schizotypal personality disorder.

**Distinguishing Schizotypal Personality Disorder from Other Medical Conditions:**
- Personality change due to another medical condition: Traits emerging from effects on the central nervous system differ from those in schizotypal personality disorder.

**Distinguishing Schizotypal Personality Disorder from Substance Use Disorders:**
- Symptoms developing in association with persistent substance use are differentiated from schizotypal personality disorder symptoms.

**Distinguishing Schizotypal Personality Disorder from Other Personality Disorders:**
- Similarities between disorders: Paranoid and schizoid personalities may have social detachment and restricted affect; Avoidant personality disorder has a fear of rejection, unlike schizotypal personality disorder's persistent detachment.
- Distinguishing features: Narcissistic personality disorder has fears of imperfections or flaws revealed; Borderline personality disorder displays transient, psychotic-like symptoms more closely related to affective shifts and dissociative experiences than enduring symptoms in schizotypal personality disorder.
- High rate of co-occurrence between the two disorders: Making distinctions is not always feasible.

**Schizotypal Features During Adolescence:**
- Transient emotional turmoil may reflect a developing personality disorder rather than an enduring condition.

**Development and Course**
- Chronic but less evident or remits as individual grows older, especially crimimal behavior reduction by fourth decade of life
- Cannot be diagnosed before age 18 years

**Risk Factors**

- Physiological: increased risk of developing antisocial personality disorder, somatic symptom disorder, and substance use disorders in family members of individuals with antisocial personality disorder
- Adoption studies indicate both genetic and environmental factors contribute to risk

**Cultural-Related Diagnosis Issues**
- Associated with low socioeconomic status and urban settings
- Concerns about misapplication diagnosis for seemingly antisocial behavior in protective survival strategies

**Gender-Related Diagnosis Issues**
- More common in males than females
- Potential underdiagnosis of females due to emphasis on aggressive items in conduct disorder definition.

###### Antisocial Personality Disorder: Diagnostic Criteria and Differentiating Factors from Other Conditions

**Differential Diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder**
- **Diagnosis**: Not given to individuals younger than 18 years and only if there is a history of conduct disorder before age 15
- For adults, a diagnosis of conduct disorder is given only if the criteria for antisocial personality disorder are not met

**Substance Use Disorders**:
- When antisocial behavior in an adult is associated with substance use disorder: Diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder not made unless signs were present in childhood and continued into adulthood

- Antisocial behavior that occurs exclusively during these disorders should not be diagnosed as antisocial personality disorder

**Other Personality Disorders**:
- Other personality disorders may be confused with antisocial personality disorder, but they can all be diagnosed if criteria are met
- Individuals with **antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder**: Tend to be glib, exploitative, lack empathy, but **narcissistic personality disorder** does not include impulsivity, aggression, deceit

- Individuals with **antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder**: Manipulative to gain nurturance vs. profit/power
- Individuals with **paranoid personality disorder** may exhibit antisocial behavior, but not motivated by personal gain or exploitation

**Criminal Behavior Not Associated with a Personality Disorder**:
- Antisocial personality traits must be inflexible, maladaptive, persistent, and cause significant functional impairment/subjective distress to constitute antisocial personality disorder

**Risk Factors for Borderline Personality Disorder**
* Genetic: five times more common among first-degree biological relatives
* Increased familial risk for substance use disorders, antisocial personality disorder, depressive or bipolar disorders
* Cultural context may influence diagnosis

**Borderline Personality Disorder vs. Other Disorders**
* Depressive and bipolar disorders: co-occurrence, clinician should avoid additional diagnosis based on cross-sectional presentation alone
* Personality disorders: distinguish based on characteristic features; all can be diagnosed if criteria met for more than one disorder
	+ Histrionic personality disorder: attention seeking, manipulative behavior, but borderline marked by self-destructiveness and abandonment concerns
	+ Paranoid personality disorder: paranoid ideas or illusions transient and interpersonally reactive in borderline vs. stable and pervasive in paranoid personality disorder
	+ Narcissistic personality disorder: angry reaction to stimuli, relative stability of self-image, lack of self-destructiveness in narcissistic vs. borderline personality disorder
	+ Antisocial personality disorder: manipulative behavior for material gain vs. goal directed toward caretakers' concern in borderline personality disorder
	+ Dependent personality disorder: fear of abandonment but reactions differ (emotional emptiness, rage, demands in borderline vs. increasing appeasement and submissiveness in dependent personality disorder)
* Personality change due to another medical condition: distinguish based on whether symptoms are attributable to effects on central nervous system
* Substance use disorders: distinguish based on whether symptoms develop in association with persistent substance use

###### Overview and Differential Diagnosis of Avoidant Personality Disorder

**Avoidant Personality Disorder**

**Prevalence**:
- Prevalence of about 2.4% based on National Epidemiologic Survey data (2001-2002)

**Development and Course**:
- Onset can start in infancy or childhood with shyness, isolation, and fear of strangers/new situations
- Shyness often dissipates as individuals get older
- Individuals with avoidant personality disorder may become increasingly shy and avoidant during adolescence and early adulthood
- Diagnosis should be used with caution in children and adolescents, as shy and avoidant behavior can be developmentally appropriate

**Culture-Related Issues**:
- Variation in how different cultural/ethnic groups view diffidence and avoidance as appropriate
- Avoidant behavior may stem from problems with acculturation following immigration

**Gender-Related Issues**:
- Appears to be equally frequent in males and females

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Overlap between avoidant personality disorder and social anxiety disorder (social phobia)
- Both feature avoidance and may co-occur
- Other personality disorders/traits can be confused with avoidant personality disorder, but all can be diagnosed if criteria are met
- Differences from other personality disorders: dependent vs. avoidant focus, preferences regarding social isolation
- Co-occurrence with schizoid or schizotypal personality disorder and paranoid personality disorder
- Avoidant traits must be inflexible, maladaptive, persistent, and cause significant functional impairment/subjective distress to constitute avoidant personality disorder
- Distinguish from personality change due to another medical condition or substance use disorders

###### "Prevalence+ Data from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Condi­ tions yielded an estimated prevalence of dependent pe...

**Prevalence**
- Estimated prevalence of dependent personality disorder: 0.49% (2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions)
- Estimated prevalence of dependent personality: 0.6% (probability subsample from Part II of the National Comorbidity Survey Replication)

**Diagnostic Considerations**

**Caution in Children and Adolescents**:
- Diagnosis of dependent personality disorder should be used with great caution, if at all, in children and adolescents
- Dependent behavior may be developmentally appropriate for some age groups

**Culture-Related Issues**:
- Degree to which dependent behaviors are considered appropriate varies significantly across different age and sociocultural groups
- Evaluate diagnostic threshold of each criterion based on age and cultural factors
- Dependent behavior should be viewed as a disorder only when it is clearly in excess of the individual's cultural norms or reflects unrealistic concerns
- Emphasis on passivity, politeness, and deferential treatment is characteristic of some societies and may be misinterpreted as traits of dependent personality disorder
- Societies may differently foster and discourage dependent behavior in males and females

**Gender-Related Issues**:
- Dependent personality disorder has been diagnosed more frequently in females
- However, some studies report similar prevalence rates among males and females
- Differentiate from other mental disorders and medical conditions that may also exhibit dependent behaviors

**Other Mental Disorders and Medical Conditions**:
- Distinguish dependent personality disorder from dependency arising as a consequence of other mental disorders (e.g., depressive disorders, panic disorder, agoraphobia) and medical conditions
- Differentiate from other personality disorders and personality traits based on characteristic features
- If an individual has personality features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to dependent personality disorder, all can be diagnosed
- Although many personality disorders are characterized by dependent features, dependent personality disorder can be distinguished by its predominantly submissive, reactive, and clinging behavior
- Borderline personality disorder vs. Dependent Personality Disorder:
  - Borderline personality disorder is characterized by fear of abandonment, but reactions to abandonment differ between the two disorders
  - Borderline personality disorder characterized by unstable and intense relationships, whereas dependent personality disorder seeks and maintains connections
- Histrionic personality disorder vs. Dependent Personality Disorder:
  - Both have a strong need for reassurance and approval, but histrionic personality disorder is characterized by gregarious flamboyance with active demands for attention
  - Dependent personality disorder is characterized by self-effacing and docile behavior
- Avoidant personality disorder vs. Dependent Personality Disorder:
  - Both have feelings of inadequacy, hypersensitivity to criticism, and a need for reassurance
  - Individuals with avoidant personality disorder withdraw until they are certain accepted, whereas dependent personalities seek and maintain connections

**Personality Traits vs. Dependent Personality Disorder**:
- Many individuals display dependent personality traits
- Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting, and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute dependent personality disorder

**Personality Change due to Another Medical Condition vs. Dependent Personality Disorder**:
- Distinguish dependent personality disorder from personality change due to another medical condition (e.g., effects on the central nervous system)

**Substance Use Disorders**:
- Distinguish dependent personality disorder from symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use

##### Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder

**Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD)**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- Pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental/interpersonal control
- At the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency
- Beginning in early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts (4 or more criteria)

**Criteria**:
1. Preoccupied with details, rules, lists, order, organization, schedules to the extent that major point is lost
2. Excessive perfectionism interfering with task completion
3. Overconscientious, scrupulous, inflexible about morality/ethics/values (not cultural or religious)
4. Unable to discard worthless objects even when no sentimental value
5. Reluctant to delegate tasks, work with others unless they submit to exact methods
6. Miserly spending style; money viewed as something to be hoarded for future catastrophes
7. Rigidity and stubbornness

**Characteristics**:
- Pervasive need for control through rules, details, procedures, lists, schedules
- Obsessive attention to detail, rechecking for mistakes
- Overly strict standards of performance causing project delays or project perfectionism
- Excessive devotion to work and productivity at the expense of leisure activities and friendships
- Scrupulous moral principles and rigid adherence to rules/performance standards
- Inability to discard objects, even with no sentimental value
- Reluctance to delegate tasks or work with others unless they conform to exact methods
- Miserly spending style, maintaining living standard below affordability
- Rigidity and stubbornness, unwillingness to compromise.

###### Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder: Diagnosis, Differential Diagnosis, and Cultural Considerations

**Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD)**

**Characteristics:**
- Difficulty making decisions due to perfectionism
- Prone to anger when unable to control environment
- Excessive deference/resistance to authority
- Controlled or stilted affection
- Preoccupied with logic and intellect
- Avoidance of emotional behavior in others
- Occupational difficulties and distress, especially with new situations

**Associated Features:**
- Anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), specific phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
- Increased likelihood of having a personality disturbance meeting criteria for OCPD
- Overlap with "type A" personality characteristics (preoccupation with work, competitiveness, time urgency)
- Association with depressive and bipolar disorders, eating disorders

**Prevalence:**
- Prevalence ranging from 2.1% to 7.9% in the general population

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Behaviors reflecting customs or interpersonal styles that are culturally sanctioned should not be considered indications of OCPD
- Cultures emphasizing work and productivity do not necessitate a diagnosis of OCPD

**Gender Differences:**
- Twice as common among males

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): presence of true obsessions and compulsions, both diagnoses can be recorded if criteria are met
- Hoarding disorder: extreme hoarding with a fire hazard and difficulty for others to walk through the house; both diagnoses can be recorded if criteria are met
- Other personality disorders or traits: distinguish based on characteristic features, multiple diagnoses can be given if applicable
- Schizoid personality disorder: fundamental lack of capacity for intimacy vs. discomfort with emotions in OCPD and flexibility/adaptability of OCPD traits
- Adaptive traits in moderation vs. inflexible, maladaptive, persisting, and causing significant functional impairment or subjective distress to constitute OCPD.

**Other Considerations:**
- Distinguish from personality change due to another medical condition or substance use disorders.

##### Other Personality Disorders

**Personality Disorders: Personality Change Due to Another Medical Condition (310.1 [F07.0])**

**Criteria:**
- A. Persistent personality disturbance following a change from previous pattern
- B. Direct physiological consequence of another medical condition

**Associated Conditions:**
- Neurological disorders: CNS neoplasms, head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, Huntington's disease, epilepsy, infectious conditions (HIV), endocrine conditions (hypothyroidism, hypo/hyperadrenocorticism), autoimmune conditions with CNS involvement
- Other medical conditions: Chronic pain and disability
- Substance use disorders: If etiologically related to personality change, use unspecified category for specific substance.

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Delirium or major neurocognitive disorder: Separate diagnosis if change occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium or if prominent part of clinical presentation.
- Another mental disorder due to another medical condition: Better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., depressive disorder, schizophrenia)
- Other personality disorders: Distinguished by requirement for clinically significant change from baseline personality functioning and presence of a specific etiological medical condition.

### Paraphilic Disorders
**Classification, Diagnosis, and Assessment**
- Voyeuristic disorder: Spying on others in private activities
- Exhibitionistic disorder: Exposing genitals
- Frotteuristic disorder: Touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual
- Sexual masochism disorder: Undergoing humiliation, bondage, or suffering
- Sexual sadism disorder: Inflicting humilation, bondage, or suffering
- Pedophilic disorder: Sexual focus on children
- Fetishistic disorder: Using nonliving objects or having a highly specific focus on nongenital body parts
- Transvestic disorder: Engaging in sexually arousing cross-dressing

**Paraphilia**: An intense and persistent sexual interest other than sexual interest in genital stimulation or preparatory fondling with phenotypically normal, physiologically mature, consenting human partners. May be difficult to apply for individuals who are very old or medically ill.
- Paraphilic disorder: A paraphilia that is currently causing distress or impairment to the individual or a paraphilia whose satisfaction has entailed personal harm, or risk of harm, to others.
- Distinction between paraphilias and paraphilic disorders: **Paraphilia** - qualitative nature (erotic focus), **Paraphilic Disorder** - negative consequences (distress, impairment, harm to others).
- Comorbid diagnoses of separate paraphilic disorders may be warranted if more than one paraphilia is causing suffering or harm.
- Clinician-rated or self-rated measures and severity assessments could address either the strength of the paraphilia itself or the seriousness of its consequences.
- Psychosocial functioning or quality of life measures can quantify phenomena like reactive depression, anxiety, guilt, poor work history, impaired social relations.
- Comparison of paraphilic sexual fantasies, urges, behaviors to normophilic interests and behaviors in clinical interview or self-administered questionnaires.

#### Voyeuristic Disorder

**Diagnostic Criteria for Voyeuristic Disorder (F65.3)**
- **Recurrent and intense sexual arousal**: from observing an unsuspecting person who is naked, disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity
- The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges/fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
- The individual is at least 18 years old

**Specifiers**
- **In controlled environment**: primarily applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings where opportunities for voyeuristic behavior are restricted
- **In full remission**: the individual has not acted on urges for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment, and there is no distress or impairment

**Diagnostic Features**
- Diagnostic criteria can apply to disclosing and nondisclosing individuals
- Disclosing individuals may report distress or psychosocial problems about their voyeuristic sexual preferences, leading to a diagnosis
- Nondisclosing individuals may deny urges/fantasies despite objective evidence of observing unsuspecting naked/sexually active persons
- Recurrent voyeuristic behavior and causing harm to others is sufficient for diagnosis
- The minimum age for diagnosis is 18 years due to difficulty distinguishing from normal sexual curiosity during adolescence

**Prevalence, Development, and Course Adults**
- Voyeuristic acts are the most common of potentially law-breaking sexual behaviors
- Unknown population prevalence, but estimated at approximately 12% in males and 4% in females for lifetime prevalence
- Onset often during adolescence, with persistence requiring contributing factors like distress, psychiatric morbidity, hypersexuality, psychosocial impairment, and/or acting out sexually by spying on unsuspecting naked or sexually active persons

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**
- Temperamental: voyeurism is a necessary precondition for voyeuristic disorder
- Environmental: childhood sexual abuse, substance misuse, and sexual preoccupation/hypersexuality may increase risk but causal relationship uncertain
- Gender-related: very uncommon in females, male-to-female ratio for acts might be 3:1

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder: additional norm-breaking behaviors and lack of specific sexual interest
- Substance use disorders: single voyeuristic episodes by intoxicated individuals without typical sexual interest

**Comorbidities**
- Hypersexuality and other paraphilic disorders, especially exhibitionistic disorder
- Depressive, bipolar, anxiety, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, and antisocial personality disorder are frequent comorbid conditions.

#### Exhibitionistic Disorder

**Exhibitionistic Disorder**

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- **302.4 (F65.2)**: Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from exposing one's genitals to an unsuspecting person
- The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person or the sexual urges/fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
- **Specify**: 
  - Sexually aroused by exposing genitals to prepubertal children
  - Sexually aroused by exposing genitals to physically mature individuals
  - Sexually aroused by exposing genitals to both prepubertal children and physically mature individuals
- **Specify if**:
  - In a controlled environment: Applicable for individuals living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to expose one's genitals are restricted
  - In full remission: The individual has not acted on the urges with a nonconsenting person, and there has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning for at least 5 years

**Subtypes**:
- Based on the age or physical maturity of the non-consenting individuals to whom the individual prefers to expose their genitals
- Non-consenting individuals could be prepubescent children, adults, or both
- This specifier should help draw attention to characteristics of victims of individuals with exhibitionistic disorder to prevent co-occurring pedophilic disorder from being overlooked

**Diagnostic Features**:
- The diagnostic criteria can apply to both disclosing and non-disclosing individuals
- Disclosing individuals may be diagnosed with exhibitionistic disorder if they report psychosocial difficulties due to their sexual attractions/preferences
- Non-disclosing individuals, who deny any sexual attraction or distress, cannot be diagnosed unless there is clear evidence of repeated behaviors causing harm to others
- Examples of non-disclosing individuals include those who have exposed themselves repeatedly but deny urges/fantasies and claim it was accidental

**Prevalence**:
- Prevalence of exhibitionistic disorder is unknown, but estimated at 2-4% in males
- Much lower prevalence in females, believed to be much lower than in males

**Development and Course**:
- Exhibitionistic sexual interest often emerges during adolescence or early adulthood
- Requires contributing factors, which may change over time

**Risk Factors**:
- **Temperamental**: Antisocial history, antisocial personality disorder, alcohol misuse, and pedophilic sexual preference may increase risk of sexual recidivism in exhibitionistic offenders
- **Environmental**: Childhood sexual/emotional abuse, sexual preoccupation/hypersexuality have been suggested as risk factors for exhibitionism
- Gender-related issues: Exhibitionistic disorder is highly unusual in females, while single sexually arousing acts may occur up to half as often in women compared to men

**Comorbid Conditions**:
- Known comorbidities include depressive, bipolar, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, hypersexuality, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, other paraphilic disorders, and antisocial personality disorder

#### Frotteuristic Disorder

**Frotteuristic Disorder (Criteria 302.89 [F65.81])**

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- **A. Over a period of at least 6 months**: recurrent and intense sexual arousal from touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting person, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors
- **B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person** or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning

**Specifiers:**
- *In a controlled environment*: applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to touch or rub against a nonconsenting person are restricted
- *In full remission*: the individual has not acted on urges and there has been no distress or impairment for at least 5 years in an uncontrolled environment

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Can apply to both disclosing and nondisclosing individuals
- Disclosing individuals may report psychosocial impairment due to their sexual preferences
- Nondisclosing individuals may deny any distress or impairment, despite objective evidence of frotteuristic behavior
- Recurrent frotteuristic behavior is sufficient for diagnosis and demonstrates harm to others
- The duration requirement (at least 6 months) is a guideline, not a strict threshold

**Important Note**: This information should be used as a reference only and should not replace professional medical advice or evaluation. If you are concerned about your own behaviors or those of someone else, please consult with a qualified healthcare provider.

###### Frotteuristic Disorder: Prevalence, Risk Factors, Diagnosis, and Comorbidities

**Frotteurism: Prevalence and Diagnostic Considerations**

**Prevalence**:
- Up to 30% of adult males in the general population may engage in frotteuristic acts
- Approximately 10-14% of adult males with paraphilic disorders and hypersexuality present with frotteuristic disorder
- Unknown population prevalence, not likely to exceed rate found in clinical settings

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- Defined by sexual touching or rubbing against unsuspecting persons without consent
- Minimum age unknown, can be difficult to distinguish from conduct disorders at younger ages
- Persistence over time unclear due to contributing factors: distress, psychiatric morbidity, hypersexuality, psychosocial impairment, and propensity for illegal acts

**Risk Factors**:
- **Temperamental:** non-sexual antisocial behavior and sexual preoccupation/hypersexuality may be risks, but causality unclear
- **Gender:** fewer females with frotteuristic preferences than males
- **Comorbidities:** hypersexuality and other paraphilic disorders (exhibitionistic disorder, voyeuristic disorder), conduct/antisocial personality disorder, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Conduct disorders: additional norm-breaking behaviors without frotteuristic sexual interest
- Substance use disorders: single episodes of frotteurism may occur, but sustained sexual interest indicates disorder

**Prognostic Factors**:
- Course likely to vary with age due to changing contributing factors

#### Sexual Masochism Disorder

**Diagnostic Criteria for Sexual Masochism Disorder (F65.51)**
- **Recurrent and intense sexual arousal** from being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer
  - Manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors
- **Clinically significant distress or impairment** in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning

**Specifiers:**

- In controlled environment: Primarily applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings with restricted opportunities for masochistic sexual behavior
- Full remission: No distress or impairment for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Individuals openly acknowledge intense sexual arousal from humiliation, beating, binding, etc.
- May experience psychosocial difficulties due to sexual attractions or preferences
- Time frame of 6 months is a guideline, not strict threshold

- Extensive use of pornography involving humiliation, beating, binding, etc.

**Prevalence:**
- Population prevalence unknown
- In Australia, estimated to be 2.2% in males and 1.3% in females for bondage and discipline within the past 12 months

**Development:**
- Mean age of onset is 19.3 years, with earlier ages reported
- Course varies based on contributing factors: distress, psychiatric morbidity, hypersexuality, etc.

**Functional Consequences:**
- Unknown, but masochists are at risk for accidental death during asphyxiophilia or other autoerotic procedures

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Transvestic fetishism
- Sexual sadism disorder
- Hypersexuality
- Alcohol and substance use disorders
- Masochistic behavior without distress (no disorder)

**Comorbidities:**
- Other paraphilic disorders, such as transvestic fetishism.

**Specifiers**:
- In controlled environment: Applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to engage in sadistic sexual behaviors are restricted
- In full remission: The individual has not acted on the urges with a nonconsenting person and there is no distress or impairment for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Apply to both those who admit to having such paraphilic interests and those who deny any sexual interest in the physical or psychological suffering of another individual despite objective evidence
- **Admitting individuals**: Those who openly acknowledge intense sexual interest in the physical or psychological suffering of others, report psychosocial difficulties, and have a history of acting on impulses
- **Denying individuals**: Those who claim no distress, anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame about their paraphilic impulses and do not act on them, despite objective evidence to the contrary

**Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis**:
- Extensive use of pornography involving pain and suffering is sometimes an associated feature

**Prevalence**:
- Population prevalence unknown but varies widely, from 2% to 30% based on criteria used
- Among civilly committed sexual offenders in the U.S., less than 10% have sexual sadism
- Among individuals who have committed sexually motivated homicides, rates range from 37% to 75%
- Dev elopment and Course: Limited information, but onset is often young adulthood and may fluctuate with distress or propensity to harm nonconsenting others

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Conditions like antisocial personality disorder, sexual masochism disorder, hypersexuality, substance use disorders can be comorbid but should be carefully evaluated as part of the Differential Diagnosis
- Majority of individuals engaging in sadistic and masochistic behaviors do not express dissatisfaction with their interests, and their behavior would not meet full criteria for sexual sadism disorder

**Comorbidities**:
- Commonly comorbid with other paraphilic disorders based on criminal acts involving nonconsenting victims, but may not apply to all individuals with a diagnosis of sexual sadism disorder who have never engaged in such acts.

#### Pedophilic Disorder

**Pedophilic Disorder (F65.4)**

**Diagnostic Features**:
- **Paraphilic Disorder**s
- The diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder apply to individuals who disclose and those who deny attraction to prepubescent children
- Diagnosis may be made even if the individual does not report distress or anxiety, provided evidence of behavior and impairment is present
- Presence of multiple victims is sufficient but not necessary for diagnosis

**Prevalence**:
- Unknown population prevalence, estimated to be approximately 3%-5% in males
- Much lower in females, likely a small fraction of the male rate

**Development and Course**:
- Can manifest during or around puberty
- Pedophilic disorder includes other elements that may change over time: distress, impairment, propensity to act out sexually with children

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**:
- **Temperamental:** Interaction between pedophilia and antisocial personality disorder
- **Environmental:** History of childhood sexual abuse may increase risk but does not necessarily indicate causation
- **Genetic and physiological:** Neurodevelopmental perturbations in utero may increase probability of developing a pedophilic orientation

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Conditions that could be comorbid include antisocial personality disorder, alcohol/substance use disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder
- Comorbidity findings may not generalize to all individuals with pedophilic disorder

**Comorbidity**:
- Psychiatric conditions: substance use disorders; depressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders; antisocial personality disorder; other paraphilic disorders

- Most individuals with this disorder are heterosexual, some have occasional sexual interactions with other males
- Development and course may be continuous or episodic, may progress to gender dysphoria

**Development:**
- Signs may begin in childhood as a fascination with women's attire
- Cross-dressing elicits sexual excitement during puberty but diminishes over time
- Desire to cross-dress remains or grows stronger, while sexual response diminishes or disappears

**Functional Consequences:**
- Can interfere with heterosexual relationships and conventional partnerships

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- **Fetishistic disorder**: Different thought patterns during cross-dressing activities and presence of other fetishes
- **Gender dysphoria**: Incongruence between experienced gender and assigned gender, desire to be the other gender, childhood cross-gender behaviors
- Individuals with both disorders should receive both diagnoses if applicable.

**Comorbidity:**
- Often found in association with other paraphilias like fetishism and masochism.

#### Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder

**Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder (302.89, F65.89)**
- Applies to presentations that exhibit symptoms of a paraphilic disorder but do not meet full criteria for any specific disorder in the diagnostic class
- Used when clinician chooses to communicate specific reason why presentation does not meet criteria for a specific paraphilic disorder (e.g., "zoophilia")
- Examples:
  - Recurrent and intense sexual arousal involving phone scatologia, necrophilia, zoophilia, coprophilia, klismaphilia, or urophilia present for at least 6 months and causing marked distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas

**Unspecified Paraphilic Disorder (302.9, F65.9)**
- Applies to presentations that exhibit symptoms of a paraphilic disorder but do not meet full criteria for any specific disorder in the diagnostic class
- Used when clinician chooses not to specify the reason why criteria are not met for a specific paraphilic disorder and there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

### Other Mental Disorders 

**Mental Disorders Included in Chapter:**
* **Other specified mental disorder due to another medical condition (294.8 [F06.8])**: Symptoms of a mental disorder predominant but do not meet full criteria for any specific mental disorder attributable to an underlying medical condition.
* **Unspecified mental disorder due to another medical condition (294.9 [F09])**:** Similar to other specified, used when the reason for not meeting specific criteria is unknown or insufficient information is available.
* **Other specified mental disorder (300.9 [F99])**:** Symptoms of a mental disorder that cause significant distress or impairment but do not meet full criteria for any specific mental disorder.
* **Unspecified mental disorder (300.9 [F99])**:** Similar to other specified, used when the reason for not meeting specific criteria is unknown or insufficient information is available.

**Criteria for Coding**:
1. Establish if the disturbance is caused by the physiological effects of another medical condition.
2. Code and list the underlying medical condition first followed by the mental disorder code. For example: 042 [B20] HIV disease, 294.8 (F06.8) other specified mental disorder due to complex partial seizures.
3. If specific etiological medical condition is unknown or insufficient information is available, record "other specified" or "unspecified mental disorder" followed by the reason and code accordingly.
4. Diagnostic codes for specific medical conditions must be listed immediately before the codes for mental disorders due to them.
5. Use the appropriate code based on the description of symptoms and level of impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

#### Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Adverse Effects of Medication

**Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Adverse Effects of Medication**

**Section II**: Includes medication-induced movement disorders:
- Important for managing mental disorders or other medical conditions
- Relevant to Differential Diagnosis (e.g., anxiety vs neuroleptic-induced akathisia, malignant catatonia vs neuroleptic malignant syndrome)

**Establishing Causal Relationship**: Difficult to establish between medication exposure and development of movement disorder
- Some disorders occur without medication exposure

**Neuroleptic Medications**: Includes:
1. Conventional, "typical," or first-generation antipsychotics (e.g., chlorpromazine, haloperidol, fluphenazine)
2. Atypical or second-generation antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine)
3. Dopamine receptor-blocking drugs for symptoms like nausea and gastritis (e.g., prochlorperazine, promethazine, trimethobenzamide, thiethylperazine, metoclopramide)
4. Amoxapine, marketed as an antidepressant
- Newer antipsychotics less likely to cause some medication-induced movement disorders but still occur

**Neuroleptic-Induced Parkinsonism**:
- 332.1 (G21.11) and (G21.19) ICD codes for this condition
- Parkinsonian tremor, muscular rigidity, akinesia, or bradykinesia developing within weeks of starting/raising neuroleptic medication dosage or after reducing neuroleptic medication to treat extrapyramidal symptoms

##### Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

**Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (333.92, G21.0)**

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Patients exposed to dopamine antagonists within 72 hours prior to symptom development
- Hyperthermia >100.4°F or 38.0°C on two occasions
- Profuse diaphoresis
- Generalized rigidity, "lead pipe" in severe form, unresponsive to anti-parkinsonian agents
- Neurological symptoms: tremor, sialorrhea, akinesia, dystonia, trismus, myoclonus, dysarthria, dysphagia, rhabdomyolysis
- Creatine kinase elevation >4x upper limit normal
- Changes in mental status: delirium or altered consciousness ranging from stupor to coma
- Autonomic activation: tachycardia, diaphoresis, blood pressure elevation/fluctuation, urinary incontinence, pallor
- Tachypnea (50% above baseline) and respiratory distress
- Workup essential to exclude other etiologies or complications

**Laboratory Findings:**
- Leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, decreased serum iron concentrations, elevations in serum muscle enzymes and catecholamines
- Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and neuroimaging studies generally normal
- Electroencephalography shows generalized slowing
- Autopsy findings nonspecific and variable

**Incidence:**
- Estimated incidence rates: 0.01%-0.02% among individuals treated with antipsychotics

**Temporal Progression:**
- Alteration in mental status and other neurological signs precede systemic signs
- Onset varies from hours to days after drug initiation, most within the first week
- Once diagnosed and drugs discontinued, neuroleptic malignant syndrome is self-limited in most cases
  - Mean recovery time: 7-10 days with most individuals recovering within 1 week and nearly all within 30 days
- Duration can be prolonged when long-acting antipsychotics are involved
- Some individuals experience residual neurological signs for weeks after acute symptoms resolve

**Risk Factors:**
- Potential risk in any individual after antipsychotic drug administration
- No specific to neuropsychiatric diagnosis, may occur without mental disorder
- Clinical, systemic, and metabolic factors associated with heightened risk: agitation, exhaustion, dehydration, iron deficiency
- Prior episode associated with antipsychotics in 15%-20% of index cases suggests underlying vulnerability
- Nearly all dopamine antagonists have been implicated, high-potency antipsychotics pose greater risk
- Partial or milder forms may be associated with newer atypical antipsychotics but vary in severity even with older drugs
- Parenteral administration routes, rapid titration rates, and higher total drug dosages have been associated with increased risk

**Differential Diagnosis:**

**DSM-5 Level Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure**:
- Patient or informant-rated measure assessing mental health domains important across psychiatric diagnoses
- Helps clinicians identify areas for further inquiry that may impact treatment and prognosis
- Can be used to track changes in symptom presentation over time
- **Adult version**: 23 questions, 13 psychiatric domains (e.g., depression, anger, mania, anxiety)
- Each domain has 1-3 questions; items ask about how much/often the individual was bothered by the symptom in the past 2 weeks
- Impaired individuals can have an informant complete the measure
- Found to be clinically useful and reliable in DSM-5 field trials
- **Parent/guardian version (ages 6-17)**: 25 questions, 12 psychiatric domains (e.g., depression, anger, irritability)
- Each item asks the parent or guardian about how much/often the child was bothered by the symptom in the past 2 weeks
- Child-rated version available for ages 11-17

**Scoring and Interpretation**:
- **Adult self-rated version**: 5-point scale (none/not at all to severe) for each item within a domain
- Scores on items should be reviewed, but **moderate or greater** in a domain (except substance use, suicidal ideation, and psychosis) may indicate further inquiry
- For **substance use, suicidal ideation, and psychosis**: **mild or greater** may indicate further inquiry
- **Highest score within a domain** indicates when to consider more detailed assessment

**Parent/Guardian-Rated Version (ages 6-17)**:
- 19 of 25 items use a 5-point scale, while suicide ideation, suicide attempt, and substance abuse are rated "Yes, No, or Don't Know"
- **Mild or greater** on 5-point-scaled items may indicate further inquiry for most domains (except inattention and psychosis)
- **Slight or greater** on inattention or psychosis may also indicate further inquiry

**Level 1 vs. Level 2**:
- Level 1: Adequate for initial assessment
- Level 2: More in-depth assessments, used to inform diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up

**Scoring and Interpretation**: Threshold scores on Level 1 indicate a need for detailed clinical inquiry. Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures can be used to obtain more information.

**Availability**: Available online at www.psychiatry.org/dsm5, with adult and pediatric (parent/child) versions available for most symptom domains.

**Frequency of Use**: Can be completed at regular intervals as clinically indicated, especially for individuals with impaired capacity or children ages 6-17 years. Consistently high scores may indicate significant symptoms warranting further assessment and treatment.

**Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure**:
- Involves the individual rating their symptoms over a two-week period across 20 symptom domains
- Includes questions about anxiety, depression, irritability, sleep disturbances, and thoughts of self-harm
- Scores range from none to severe, with the highest score indicating a need for further clinical inquiry.

**The WHODAS 2.0**:
- A 36-item self-administered measure used to assess disability in adults aged 18 and older
- Evaluates functioning across six domains: understanding and communicating, getting around, self-care, getting along with people, life activities (household/work/school), and participation in society

**Scoring Methods**:
- **Simple Scoring**: Summing the scores of each item without recoding or weighting
- **Complex (Item Response Theory) Scoring**: Differentially weighing items and response levels to determine the summary score

**Domain Scores**:
- WHODAS 2.0 produces domain-specific scores for six areas: cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities, and participation

**Population Norms**:
- Population norms and distribution of IRT-based scores are available on the WHO website

**Clinician Use**:
- Clinicians are encouraged to review individual's responses and indicate their own score for each item
- If necessary, clinicians may correct the self-reported score based on clinical interview
- WHODAS 2.0 domain and general disability scores can be calculated as an average of all items in a domain or across the entire measure
- The simple and average scores are comparable to the WHODAS 5-point scale, allowing clinicians to think about the individual's disability in terms of none (1), mild (2), moderate (3), severe (4), or extreme (5)

**Frequency of Use**:
- Measure can be completed at regular intervals to track changes in disability over time

#### Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) Informant Version

**Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI)-Informant Version**

**Introduction for the Interviewer**:
- Collect collateral information from an informant about the clinical problem of an individual
- Supplements information obtained from the core CFI or can be used instead when the individual is unable to provide information

**Relationship with the Patient**:
- Clarify the informant's relationship with the patient and/or their family
1. **How would you describe your relationship to [INDNIDUAL OR TO FAMILY]?**
   - Probe for details if not clear: How often do you see them?

**Cultural Definition of the Problem**:
- Elicit the informant's view of core problems and key concerns
2. **What brings your family member/friend here today?**
   - If informant gives few details or only mentions symptoms/diagnosis: Probe for a more comprehensive description
3. **How would you describe [INDNIDUAL'S] problem?**
   - Focus on the informant's framing of the problem
4. **What troubles you most about [INDNIDUAL'S] problem?**

**Cultural Concepts of Distress**

**Types of Cultural Concepts:**
- **Cultural syndromes**: Clusters of symptoms and attributions that co-occur among cultural groups, communities, or contexts.
- **Cultural idioms of distress**: Ways of expressing distress without involving specific symptoms or syndromes.
- **Cultural explanations/perceived causes**: Labels, attributions, or features of an explanatory model that indicate culturally recognized meaning or etiology for symptoms, illness, or distress.

**Relevance to Clinical Practice:**
- Clinically important cultural differences often involve explanations or experience of distress rather than culturally distinctive configurations of symptoms.
- Cultural concepts have four key features in relation to the DSM-5 nosology:
  * One-to-many correspondence between cultural concept and DSM diagnostic entity.
  * Wide range of severity, including presentations not meeting DSM criteria for mental disorder.
  * Frequent use of same term for more than one type of cultural concept (e.g., "depression").
  * Changes over time in response to both local and global influences.

**Importance of Cultural Concepts in Psychiatric Diagnosis:**
- To avoid misdiagnosis: Cultural variation in symptoms and explanatory models may lead clinicians to misunderstand the severity or assign wrong diagnosis.
- To obtain useful clinical information: Cultural variations in symptoms and attributions are associated with particular features of risk, resilience, and outcome.
- To improve clinical rapport and engagement: Speaking the patient's language can result in greater communication, facilitated treatment negotiation, and higher retention and adherence.
- To improve therapeutic efficacy: Culture influences psychological mechanisms of disorder, which need to be understood and addressed for better clinical outcomes.
- To guide clinical research: Locally perceived connections between cultural concepts may help identify patterns of comorbidity and underlying biological substrates.
- To clarify the cultural epidemiology: Cultural concepts are not endorsed uniformly in a culture, and distinguishing syndromes, idioms, and explanations can provide an approach for studying their distribution and determinants.

**DSM-5 Information on Cultural Concepts:**
- DSM-5 criteria and text contain information about cultural variations in prevalence, symptomatology, associated cultural concepts, and other clinical aspects.
- Other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention (V codes or Z codes) correspond to some clinical concerns identified by the CFI, such as acculturation problems, parent-child relational problems, or religious/spiritual problems.
- Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress located in Appendix provides examples and interrelationships among cultural syndromes, idioms of distress, and causal explanations.

### Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders

**DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (Alternative)**

**General Criteria for Personality Disorder:**
- **A. Impairment in personality functioning**: Self (identity, self-direction) and interpersonal (empathy, intimacy) functioning are evaluated on a continuum.
- **B. Pathological personality traits**: Organized into five broad domains: Negative Affectivity, Detachment, Antagonism, Disinhibition, Psychoticism; 25 specific trait facets were developed.
- **C. Pervasiveness**: Impairments in personality functioning and pathological personality traits are relatively pervasive across various contexts.
- **D. Stability**: Impairments in personality functioning and pathological personality traits are relatively stable over time, with onsets tracing back to adolescence or early adulthood.
- **E. Specificity**: Diagnosis of a personality disorder requires assessment of level of impairment in personality functioning (Criterion A) and evaluation of pathological personality traits (Criterion B).
- **F. Alternative explanations**: Impairments may be attributable to other mental disorders, substances, medical conditions or developmental stages/environments; these must be ruled out before making a diagnosis.

**Criteria for Personality Disorder:**
1. **A. Level of Personality Functioning**: Assess self (identity, self-direction) and interpersonal (empathy, intimacy) functioning using the Level of Personality Functioning Scale (LPFS).
2. **B. Pathological Personality Traits**: Evaluate 25 specific trait facets within five broad domains: Negative Affectivity, Detachment, Antagonism, Disinhibition, Psychoticism.
3. **C. Pervasiveness and Stability**: Impairments are pervasive across a range of personal and social contexts but less so for the most extremely pathological personalities.
4. **D. Specificity (Differential Diagnosis)**: Other mental disorders, substances, medical conditions or developmental stages/environments may present with similar symptoms; assess these alternatives to rule out before making a diagnosis.
5. **E. Level of Impairment in Personality Functioning**: A moderate level is required for the diagnosis of a personality disorder based on empirical evidence.
6. **F. Diagnosis**: If another mental disorder is present, the personality disorder diagnosis is not made if the manifestations of the personality disorder are an expression of that disorder. However, assess for comorbid personality disorders in patients with other mental disorders as they can impact the course of treatment.

#### Personality Disorder Scoring Algorithms

**Personality Disorder Scoring Algorithms**
- Based on maximizing relationship of criteria to corresponding personality disorders
- Diagnostic thresholds for B criteria set empirically to minimize changes from DSM-IV, overlap with other disorders, and maximize relationships with functional impairment
- Resulting diagnostic criteria sets represent clinically useful personality disorders with high fidelity

**Personality Disorder Diagnosis**
- Individuals with a pattern of impairment in personality functioning and maladaptive traits matching one of the six defined personality disorders should be diagnosed with that personality disorder
- Option exists for noting prominent but not required traits as specifiers
- Individuals whose functioning or trait pattern is substantially different from any of the six specific disorders should be diagnosed with **Personality Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PO-TS)**
  - May not meet required number of A or B criteria, indicating a subthreshold presentation
  - May have a mix of features of multiple personality disorder types or an atypical combination of traits
  - Pathological personality trait combinations can be specified using the **Level of Personality Functioning Scale (LPFS)** and the pathological trait taxonomy
- Current diagnoses of paranoid, schizoid, histrionic, and dependent personality disorders are represented by PO-TS with moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning

**Personality Functioning Dimension Definition**
- Personality functioning is distributed on a continuum
- Optimal function includes a complex, well-integrated self-concept; rich emotional life; and adaptive interpersonal behavior
- Severe personality pathology involves an impoverished, disorganized, and conflicted psychological world, including a weak self-concept, dysregulated emotions, and deficient interpersonal function
- Generalized severity is the most important predictor of concurrent and prospective dysfunction

**Level of Personality Functioning Scale (LPFS)**
- Characterizes personality disorders by a generalized personality severity continuum with additional specification of stylistic elements
- Cores of personality psychopathology include impairment in ideas and feelings regarding self and interpersonal relationships
- Components of LPFS - **identity, self-direction, empathy, intimacy** - are central to describing the personality functioning continuum
- Mental representations of self and interpersonal relationships are reciprocally influential and impact treatment efficacy and outcome
- Degree of disturbance in self and interpersonal functioning is continuously distributed, but rating the current level is necessary for diagnosis and treatment planning

#### Personality Traits Definition and Description

**Personality Traits: Definition, Description, and Assessment**

**Definition of Personality Traits:**
- Consistent patterns of feeling, perceiving, behaving, and thinking
- Tendency to act in specific ways across time and situations
- Example: anxiousness versus calmness

**Dimensionality of Personality Traits:**
- Everyone falls on the spectrum of trait dimensions
- Broad domains comprise narrow range of behaviors (facets)
- Examples: callousness vs. kindheartedness, detachment vs. extraversion

**Five Domains of the Section III Model:**
1. Negative Affectivity (vs. Emotional Stability)
2. Detachment (vs. Extraversion)
3. Antagonism (vs. Agreeableness)
4. Disinhibition (vs. Conscientiousness)
5. Psychoticism (vs. Lucidity)

**Personality Traits vs. Symptoms:**
- Traits are consistent patterns, symptoms wax and wane
- Specific behaviors manifest trait tendencies
- Behaviors aggregate to represent traits

**Assessment of the DSM-5 Section III Personality Trait Model:**
1. Review all five broad domains systematically
2. Use formal psychometric instruments (e.g., PID-5) for assessment
3. Collect patient and informant report data on facets if possible
4. Make clinical judgment based on testing, interview, and population norms
5. Consider elevated traits as contributing to Criterion B of Section III disorders

**Utility of Multidimensional Personality Functioning and Trait Model:**
- Both disorder and trait constructs add value in:
  - Antecedent variables (family history, childhood abuse)
  - Concurrent variables (functional impairment, medication use)
  - Predictive variables (hospitalization, suicide attempts)
- Assessment of personality functioning and pathological personality traits is relevant for all mental disorders.

**Table 2: Level of Personality Functioning Scale**

**SELF Identity:**
- **0 - Little to no impairment**: Ongoing awareness of unique self, maintains role-appropriate boundaries, consistent and self-regulated positive self-esteem with accurate self-appraisal. Capable of experiencing a full range of emotions with relatively intact sense of self.
- **1 - Some impairment**: Compromised ability to maintain a clear sense of self, with decreased clarity of boundaries when strong emotions are experienced. Diminished self-esteem at times, with overly critical or distorted self-appraisal. Strong emotions may be distressing and associated with restriction in emotional range.
- **2 - Moderate impairment**: Depends excessively on others for identity definition, compromised boundary definition, and fragile self-esteem controlled by external evaluation. Emotional regulation depends on positive external appraisal, with unnuanced self-appraisal (self-loathing, self-aggrandizing, or illogical combination).
- **3 - Severe impairment**: Absent sense of autonomy and agency, poor boundary definition, frangile self-esteem easily influenced by events, uncoherent self-image.
- **4 - Extreme impairment**: Virtual absence of unique self and agency, confused or lacking boundaries with others, weak or distorted self-image, emotions not congruent with context or internal experience, hatred and aggression dominant affects (may be disavowed).

**INTERPERSONAL Empathy:**
- **0 - Little to no impairment**: Capable of understanding others' experiences and motivations in most situations, appreciating their perspectives even if disagreeing. Aware of the effect of own actions on others.
- **1 - Some impairment**: Compromised ability to appreciate and understand others' experiences; can consider alternative perspectives but may resist doing so. Unaware or unconcerned about impact of own behavior on others, or unrealistic appraisal of own impact.
- **2 - Moderate impairment**: Hyperattuned to others' experiences only with respect to perceived relevance to self, excessively self-referential, significantly compromised ability to appreciate and understand others' experiences, and consider alternative perspectives. Unaware or unconcerned about impact of own behavior on others.
- **3 - Severe impairment**: Profoundly unable to consider and understand others' thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Confused about or unaware of the impact of one's actions on others; destructive motivations frequently misattributed to others. Limited capacity for positive and enduring connections in relationships.
- **4 - Extreme impairment**: Pronounced inability to understand others' experiences, attention focused on need fulfillment and harm avoidance, social interactions confusing and disorienting.

**Intimacy:**
- **0 - Little to no impairment**: Maintains multiple satisfying and enduring relationships, desires and engages in caring, close, and reciprocal relationships, strives for cooperation and mutual benefit.
- **1 - Some impairment**: Capable of forming relationships but connections may be largely superficial. Intimate relationships based on meeting self-regulatory and self-esteem needs, unrealistic expectation of being perfectly understood by others. Tends not to view relationships in reciprocal terms, cooperates predominantly for personal gain.
- **2 - Moderate impairment**: Capable of forming relationships but connections may be primarily based on meeting self-regulatory and self-esteem needs or expectations of abandonment or abuse. Feelings about intimate involvement alternate between fear of rejection and desperate desire for connection, little mutuality.
- **3 - Severe impairment**: Some desire to form relationships but capacity for positive and enduring connections is significantly impaired. Relationships based on strong belief in the absolute need for the intimate other(s) or expecta­tions of abandonment or abuse. Feelings about intimate involvement alternate between fear of rejection and desperate desire for connection, little mutuality.
- **4 - Extreme impairment**: Limited desire for affiliation due to profound disinterest or expectation of harm, engagement with others is detached, disorganized, or consistently negative. Relationships conceptualized primarily in terms of their ability to provide comfort or inflict pain and suffering, social/interpersonal behavior seeks fulfillment of basic needs or escape from pain rather than being reciprocal.

### Conditions for Further Study

**Proposed Criteria Sets for Further Study**

**Conditions**:
- Proposed criteria sets presented for conditions on which future research is encouraged
- Specific items, thresholds, and durations contained were set by expert consensus informed by literature review, data reanalysis, and field trial results, where available
- Intended to provide a common language for researchers and clinicians interested in studying these disorders
- Research will allow better understanding of these conditions and inform decisions about possible placement in future editions of DSM

**Empirical Review**:
- DSM-5 Task Force subjected each proposed criteria set to a careful empiricial review
- Invited wide commentary from the field as well as from the general public

**Limitations**:
- Insufficient evidence to warrant inclusion as official mental disorder diagnoses in Section II of DSM-5
- Proposed criteria sets not intended for clinical use; only those in Section II are officially recognized and can be used for clinical purposes.

#### Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome

**Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome: Proposed Criteria**
- **A. At least one of the following symptoms is present:**
  - Delusions
  - Hallucinations
  - Disorganized speech
- Symptoms must have been present at least once per week for the past month
- Symptoms must have begun or worsened in the past year
- Symptoms are of sufficient severity and frequency to warrant clinical attention
- Criteria B, C, D, and E must be met

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Attenuated psychosis symptoms are below the threshold for a full psychotic disorder
- Compared to psychotic disorders, symptoms are less severe and more transient, with relatively intact reality testing
- Symptoms suggest a change in mental state, indicating functional impairment rather than long-standing trait pathology
- Attenuated delusions may have suspicious or persecutory ideational content
  - Guarded, distrustful attitude
  - Unrealistic sense of superior capacity
  - May disrupt behavior but skepticism about reality can be induced
- Attenuated hallucinations include alterations in sensory perception, often auditory and/or visual
  - Moderate: unformed, unusual or puzzling experiences
  - Severe: vivid and frequent recurring illusions or hallucinations
- Disorganized communication may manifest as odd, unfocused, or meandering speech
  - Moderate: individual gets into irrelevant topics but responds easily to clarifying questions
  - Severe: individual fails to get to the point without external guidance
- Individual must experience distress and impaired performance in social or role functioning
  - Clinical care sought by the individual or responsible others

**Associated Features:**
- Magical thinking
- Perceptual aberrations
- Difficulty concentrating
- Excessive suspiciousness
- Anxiety
- Social withdrawal
- Disruption in sleep-wake cycle
- Impaired cognitive function and negative symptoms observed
- Neuroimaging variables distinguish cohorts with attenuated psychosis syndrome from normal controls, but individual-level diagnosis not possible

**Prevalence**
- Unknown prevalence of attenuated psychosis syndrome
- Symptoms in Criterion A common in non-help seeking population: 8-13% for hallucinatory experiences, delusional thinking
- Slight male predominance
- Development and course: mid-to-late adolescence or early adulthood
- Approx. 18% progress symptomatically to psychotic disorder in one year, 32% in three years
- Diagnosis best applied for individuals ages 15-35 years
- Long-term course not yet described beyond 7-12 years

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**
- Temperamental: negative symptoms, cognitive impairment, poor functioning increase risk of transition to psychosis
- Genetic: family history of psychosis increases risk for developing a full disorder
- Structural, functional, neurochemical imaging data associated with increased risk of transition to psychosis

**Functional Consequences of Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome**
- Functional impairments may persist despite symptom abatement
- Substantial portion improves over time, some continue mild symptoms or impairment, others have full recovery

**Differential Diagnosis**
- **Brief psychotic disorder**: symptoms do not cross the psychosis threshold and reality testing/insight remains intact
- **Schizotypal personality disorder**: stable trait disorder, broader array of symptoms required, early stages may resemble attenuated psychosis syndrome
- **Depressive or bipolar disorders**: reality distortions limited to episodes, do not meet Criterion E for attenuated psychosis syndrome
- **Anxiety disorders**: reality distortions limited to anxiety disorder episodes, do not meet Criterion E for attenuated psychosis syndrome
- **Bipolar II disorder**: reality distortions limited to mania or hypomania, descriptively more characteristic of bipolar disorder
- **Borderline personality disorder**: reality distortions concomitant with borderline personality disorder and more characteristic of it
- **Adjustment reaction of adolescence**: mild, transient symptoms not qualifying for attenuated psychosis syndrome
- **Extreme end of perceptual aberration and magical thinking in the non-ill population**: diagnostic possibility when no distress or functional impairment is present
- **Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder**: preferred diagnosis if other characteristic symptoms strongly related to substance use episodes
- **Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder**: history of attentional impairment does not exclude current attenuated psychosis syndrome diagnosis. Comorbidity may be reconceptualized as prodromal phase of another disorder.

#### Depressive Episodes With Short-Duration

**Depressive Episodes With Short-Duration**

**Proposed Criteria for Major Depressive Episode:**
- Lifetime experience of at least one major depressive episode
- Five (or more) of the following symptoms: depressed mood or loss of interest/pleasure, weight change, insomnia/hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation/retardation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness/excessive guilt, diminished ability to think/concentrate, and suicidal ideation
- Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational functioning
- Not attributable to physiological effects of a substance or medical condition
- Not better explained by schizophrenia spectrum disorders

**Proposed Criteria for Hypomanic Episode:**
- At least two lifetime episodes of hypomanic periods (insufficient duration: 2 days but less than 4 consecutive days)
- Distinct period of abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and increased goal-directed activity or energy
- Three (or more) symptoms persist, represent noticeable change from usual behavior, present to a significant degree: inflated self-esteem/grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, more talkative than usual, flight of ideas, distractibility, increase in goal-directed activity/psychomotor agitation, excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences
- Associated with unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharacteristic of individual when not symptomatic
- Observable by others
- Not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or necessitate hospitalization
- Not attributable to physiological effects of a substance (e.g., drug, medication)

**Diagnostic Features:**
Individuals with short-duration hypomania have experienced:
- At least one major depressive episode
- Minimum two episodes of 2-3 days' duration meeting hypomanic episode criteria

Associated Features:
- Increased comorbidity with substance use disorders
- Greater family history of bipolar disorder
- Differences between individuals with short-duration hypomania and syndromal bipolar disorder: greater work impairment for individuals with syndromal bipolar disorder, estimated average number of episodes.

**Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Differential Diagnosis**
- Prevalence unclear due to new criteria
- Estimated that short-duration hypomania occurs in 2.8% of the population (compared to 5.5% for hypomania or mania)
- More common in females, who may present with more features of atypical depression

**Risk and Prognostic Factors**:
- **Genetic and physiological risk**: Family history of mania is less common than in syndromal bipolar disorder but more common than in the general population
- Higher rates of suicide attempts compared to healthy individuals, but not as high as in individuals with syndromal bipolar disorder
- **Functional consequences**: Less work impairment than syndromal bipolar disorder but more comorbid substance use disorders, particularly alcohol use disorder, than major depressive disorder

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- **Bipolar II disorder**: Characterized by at least 4 days of hypomanic symptoms; short-duration hypomania leads to this diagnosis after a longer hypomanic episode
- **Major depressive disorder**: Characterized by at least one lifetime major depressive episode; presence of short-duration hypomanic episodes leads to this diagnosis
- **Major depressive disorder with mixed features**: Hypomanic symptoms present concurrently with major depressive episode, while in short-duration hypomania they occur separately
- **Bipolar I disorder**: Characterized by at least one lifetime manic episode (longer and more severe than a hypomanic episode); short-duration hypomania is not a subtype of bipolar I
- **Cyclothymic disorder**: Characterized by periods of depressive symptoms and hypomanic symptoms, but major depressive episode precludes this diagnosis

**Comorbidities**:
- Higher rates of comorbid anxiety disorders and substance use disorders than in the general population

#### Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder

**Proposed Criteria for Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder (PCBD)**

A. **Experienced the death of a close relationship:**
- Individual experienced the death of someone they had a close relationship with.

B. **Symptoms persist beyond normal grief:**
1. **Persistent yearning/longing for deceased:**
   - Intense sorrow and emotional pain
   - Young children may express this through behavior reflecting separation and reuniting with caregiver or attachment figure
2. **Preoccupation with deceased:**
   - Preoccupation with circumstances of death
3. **Additional symptoms persist for at least 12 months (6 months in children):**
   a. Reactive distress to the death
      * Marked difficulty accepting death
         + Dependent on child's capacity to comprehend meaning and permanence of death
      * Disbelief or emotional numbness over loss
      * Difficulty with positive reminiscing about deceased
      b. Bitterness or anger related to loss
   c. Maladaptive appraisals about self in relation to deceased or death
   d. Excessive avoidance of reminders of the loss (e.g., individuals, places, situations associated with deceased)
         + In children: avoidance of thoughts and feelings regarding deceased may extend to possible death of others close to them
   e. Desire to die in order to be with deceased
   f. Difficulty trusting other individuals since the death
   g. Feeling alone or detached from others since the death
   h. Life has no meaning or feels empty without the deceased
      + Belief that cannot function without them
   i. Confusion about one's role in life, identity feeling a part has died
   j. Difficulty engaging in activities, pursuing relationships, planning future
4. **Disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment**
5. **Out-of-proportion to cultural norms:**

C. **Additional symptoms with traumatic bereavement:**
- Bereavement due to homicide or suicide
- Preoccupation with traumatic nature of death (e.g., last moments, degree of suffering)
- Persistent distressing preoccupations regarding the traumatic nature of the death.

**Symptoms, Risk Factors, and Differential Diagnosis**
**Prevalence:**
- Approximately 2.4%-4.8% prevalence
- More common in females than males

**Occurrence:**
- Can occur at any age, starting after the first year
- Symptoms begin within initial months following death
- Persists beyond 12 months (6 months for children) after bereavement

**Symptoms:**
- Distress and disrupted functioning
- Severe grief reactions persisting beyond cultural norms

**Children and Adolescents:**
- Expression of distress in play, behavior, developmental regressions, and anxious or protest behavior at times of separation and reunion
- Separation distress predominant in younger children
- Social/identity distress and risk for depression more prominent in older children and adolescents

**Risk Factors:**
- Increased dependency on the deceased person prior to death
- Death of a child
- Disturbances in caregiver support
- Being female

**Culture:**
- Symptoms may manifest in culturally specific ways
- Diagnosis requires symptoms going beyond cultural norms and not explained by mourning rituals

**Suicide Risk:**

**Functional Consequences:**
- Deficits in work and social functioning
- Harmful health behaviors, such as increased tobacco and alcohol use
- Increased risks for serious medical conditions like cardiac disease, hypertension, cancer, immunological deficiency, and reduced quality of life

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Normal grief: severe reactions persist at least 12 months after death and interfere with functioning
- Major depressive disorder (MDD), persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia): share some symptoms but characterized by different focuses
- Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD): intrusive thoughts revolve around traumatic event, avoidance consistent in PTSD, preoccupation and yearning for deceased in PCBD
- Separation anxiety disorder: anxiety about separation from current attachment figures vs. distress over separation from deceased individual

**Comorbidities:**
- Most common comorbid disorders: major depressive disorder (MDD), PTSD, substance use disorders
- PTSD more frequently comorbid when death occurred in traumatic or violent circumstances.

#### Caffeine Use Disorder

**Caffeine Use Disorder Proposed Criteria (DSM-5)**
* **Characteristics:** Continued caffeine use despite negative physical and psychological consequences
* **Prevalence:** 14% of caffeine users met criterion of use despite harm, most reporting harm from medical or counselor advice
* **Symptoms:** Persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to control use (50%), withdrawal (18%), tolerance (8%), using more than intended (28%), spending a great deal of time on caffeine (93%)
* **Desire to Quit:** 88% reported making prior attempts to modify use, 43% advised by medical professional
* **Diagnostic Criteria:** Persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to control use, continued use despite harm, withdrawal symptoms, tolerance, using larger amounts or longer than intended, spending significant time on caffeine, craving or strong desire for caffeine
* **DSM-IV Criteria:** Withdrawal syndrome, persistent desire or unsuccessful attempts to reduce caffeine use, use despite harmful consequences, cessation of use resulting in distress or impairment.

**Caffeine Use Disorder Symptoms:**
1. Persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to control caffeine use
2. Continued caffeine use despite harm (physical or psychological)
3. Withdrawal: characteristic withdrawal syndrome, taking caffeine to relieve symptoms
4. Tolerance: increased amount needed for desired effect, diminished effect with continued use
5. Spending significant time on obtaining, using, or recovering from caffeine effects
6. Craving or strong desire for caffeine that cannot be resisted
7. Use resulting in failure to fulfill major role obligations (work, school, home)
8. Social/interpersonal problems caused by caffeine use
9. Continued use despite negative consequences (arguments with spouse, medical problems, cost).

**Caffeine Use Disorder Prevalence and Characteristics:**
- **Prevalence**: Unclear, estimated to be less than 7% among regular caffeine users based on studies using four dependence criteria
- **Risk Factors**: Genetic (heritability of heavy use ranges from 35% to 77%) and physiological factors contribute to caffeine use disorder
- **Symptoms**: Includes tolerance, withdrawal, and consumption that impairs daily activities

**Diagnosis:**
- Difficult to distinguish from nonproblematic use of caffeine
- May be comorbid with other disorders such as anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder) or substance use disorders (alcohol, cannabis, cocaine)
- Symptoms may mimic other stimulant use disorders or mental health conditions

**Consequences:**
- Greater caffeine intake during pregnancy possible for individuals with caffeine use disorder
- Caffeine withdrawal can lead to functional impairment in daily activities
- Caffeine intoxication may cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and impaired normal functioning. 

**Prevalence**:
- Based on DSM-IV-TR criteria for dependence: 30% of current caffeine users may have met all seven criteria
- With four primary criteria, prevalence drops to 9% among regular caffeine users
- Estimated prevalence is less than 7% in the general population
- Higher prevalence (20%) among high-risk groups like students, individuals in drug treatment, or those with recent alcohol/illicit drug misuse histories.

**Genetic and Physiological Factors**:
- Heritability of heavy caffeine use, tolerance, and withdrawal ranges from 35% to 77%
- Common genetic factor (polysubstance use) underlies use of caffeine, alcohol, and cigarettes; 28%-41% shared heritable effects
- Caffeine and tobacco use disorders substantially influenced by unique genetic factors.

**Functional Consequences:**
- Greater caffeine intake during pregnancy possible for individuals with caffeine use disorder
- Caffeine withdrawal can lead to functional impairment in daily activities
- Caffeine intoxication may cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and impaired normal functioning.

#### Internet Gaming Disorder

**Internet Gaming Disorder Proposed Criteria**

**Persistent and recurrent use of Internet games leading to clinically significant impairment or distress**:
- Preoccupation with Internet games:
    - Individual thinks about previous gaming activity or anticipates playing the next game
    - Internet gaming becomes dominant activity in daily life
- Withdrawal symptoms when Internet gaming is taken away:
    - Irritability, anxiety, or sadness
    - No physical signs of pharmacological withdrawal
- Tolerance: Need to spend increasing amounts of time engaged in Internet games

- Loss of interests in previous hobbies and entertainment as a result of, and with the exception of, Internet games
- Continued excessive use of Internet games despite knowledge of psychosocial problems
- Has deceived family members, therapists, or others regarding the amount of Internet gaming
- Use of Internet games to escape or relieve negative moods (e.g., helplessness, guilt, anxiety)
- Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational/career opportunity because of participation in Internet games

**Specify current severity**:
- Internet gaming disorder can be mild, moderate, or severe depending on degree of disruption of normal activities
- Individuals with less severe Internet gaming disorder may exhibit fewer symptoms and less disruption of their lives
- Those with severe Internet gaming disorder will have more hours spent on the computer and more severe loss of relationships or career/school opportunities

**Subtypes**:
- No well-researched subtypes for Internet gaming disorder to date
- Most often involves specific Internet games, but could involve non-Internet computerized games
- Preferred games may vary over time as new games are developed and popularized

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Similarities to gambling disorder and substance use disorders
- High prevalence rates, both in Asian countries and to a lesser extent in the West
- Justified inclusion in **DSM-5** Section III as a potential independent disorder
- Lack of standard definition, absence of natural history data, and limited epidemiological studies

**Symptoms**:
- Persistent and recurrent participation in computer gaming, typically group games
- Involves competition between groups of players (often across different global regions) for many hours
- Team aspects are a key motivation
- Attempts to direct the individual toward schoolwork or personal/interpersonal activities are strongly resisted
- Major reasons for using the computer are more likely to be "avoiding boredom" than communicating or searching for information

**Associated Features**:
- No consistent personality types associated with Internet gaming disorder
- Some authors describe associated diagnoses, such as depressive disorders, ADHD, or OCD
- Individuals with compulsive Internet gaming have demonstrated brain activation in specific regions triggered by exposure to the Internet game but not limited to reward system structures

**Internet Gaming Disorder: Prevalence, Environmental Risks, and Functions**

**Prevalence of Internet Gaming Disorder**
- Varying questionnaires, criteria, and thresholds used
- Highest prevalence in Asian countries and male adolescents aged 12-20 years
- Fewer reports from Europe and North America
- Point prevalence: 8.4% for males, 4.5% for females among adolescents (ages 15-19) in one Asian study using a threshold of five criteria

**Environmental Risks of Internet Gaming Disorder**
- Computer availability with an Internet connection is a risk factor
- Genetic and physiological factors are also contributing factors, but clarity is lacking
- Adolescent males at greatest risk; possible link to Asian environmental background

**Functions of Internet Gambling Disorder**
- May lead to school failure, job loss, or marriage failure
- Compulsive gaming behavior crowds out normal social, scholastic, and family activities
- Students may exhibit declining grades and ultimately fail in school
- Family responsibilities may be neglected.

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Excessive use of Internet for activities other than online gaming (e.g., social media, viewing pornography) is not equivalent to Internet gaming disorder
  *Guidelines suggest following similar research methods as for Internet gaming disorder*
- Excessive gambling online may qualify for a separate diagnosis of Gambling Disorder
- Comorbidities: Neglect of physical health due to compulsive gaming
- Other associated diagnoses: Major Depressive Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)

#### Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated With Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (ND-PAE)

**Proposed Criteria:**
* More than minimal exposure to alcohol during gestation, including prior to pregnancy recognition
* Confirmation of gestational exposure to alcohol through maternal self-report, medical or other records, or clinical observation

**Manifesters of Impairment:**
1. **Neurocognitive Functioning**:
   * Global intellectual performance: IQ below 70 or standard score below 70 on a comprehensive developmental assessment
   * Executive functioning: poor planning and organization, inflexibility, difficulty with behavioral inhibition
   * Learning: lower academic achievement than expected for intellectual level, specific learning disability
   * Memory impairment: problems remembering recently learned information, repeatedly making the same mistakes, difficulty remembering lengthy verbal instructions
   * Visual-spatial reasoning: disorganized or poorly planned drawings or constructions, problems differentiating left from right
2. **Self-Regulation**:
   * Mood or behavioral regulation: mood lability, negative affect or irritability, frequent behavioral outbursts
   * Attention deficit: difficulty shifting attention, difficulty sustaining mental effort
   * Impulse control: difficulty waiting turn, difficulty complying with rules
3. **Adaptive Functioning**:
   * Communication deficits: delayed acquisition of language, difficulty understanding spoken language
   * Social communication and interaction: overly friendly with strangers, difficulty reading social cues, difficulty understanding social consequences
4. **Onset of Disturbance**: Occurs in childhood
5. **Clinically Significant Distress or Impairment**: Causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
6. **Exclusions:** Not better explained by direct physiological effects of postnatal substance use, general medical condition, teratogenic condition, genetic condition, or environmental neglect
7. **Diagnostic Features**: Manifestation of impairment in neurocognitive, behavioral, and adaptive functioning associated with prenatal alcohol exposure
8. **Associated Features**: Variable depending on age, degree of alcohol exposure, and individual's environment; can include ongoing parental alcohol/substance misuse, maternal mental illness, exposure to domestic or community violence, neglect or abuse, disrupted caregiving relationships, multiple out-of-home placements, and lack of continuity in medical or mental health care.

**Prevalence of ND-PAE**:
- Unknown prevalence rates of ND-PAE
- Estimated prevalence of clinical conditions associated with prenatal alcohol exposure: 2%-5% in the United States

**Developmental Progression**:
- Developmental delays seen in up to one-half of young children prenatally exposed to alcohol by age 3
- Children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure may not exhibit signs of CNS dysfunction until preschool or school-age
- Impairments in higher order cognitive processes (e.g., executive functioning) are more easily assessed in older children
- Learning difficulties, impairment in executive function, and problems with integrative language functions emerge more clearly as children reach school age
- Social skills deficits and challenging behavior become more evident as requirements become more complex

**Diagnosis of ND-PAE**:
- Most likely to be diagnosed in the school years due to emergence of learning difficulties, executive functioning impairments, and integrative language problems
- High risk for suicide, with rates increasing significantly in late adolescence and early adulthood

**Functional Consequences of ND-PAE**:
- CNS dysfunction leads to decreased adaptive behavior and maladaptive behaviors with lifelong consequences
- Higher prevalence of disrupted school experiences, poor employment records, trouble with the law, confinement (legal or psychiatric), and dependent living conditions

**Differential Diagnosis**:
- Disorders attributable to postnatal substance use, other medical conditions, or environmental neglect
- Physiological effects of postnatal substance use (e.g., medication, alcohol)
- Other neurocognitive disorders (e.g., traumatic brain injury, delirium, major neurocognitive disorder [dementia])
- Genetic and teratogenic conditions (e.g., Williams syndrome, Down syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome)

**Comorbidity**:
- Mental health problems identified in over 90% of individuals with significant prenatal alcohol exposure
- Most common co-occurring diagnosis is attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
- Other high-probability co-occurring disorders include oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder
- Mood symptoms, including bipolar disorder and depressive disorders, have been described
- Increased risk for later tobacco, alcohol, and other substance use disorders

#### Suicidal Behavior Disorder

**Suicidal Behavior Disorder Criteria**

A. **Suicide Attempt:**
- Within last 24 months: a self-initiated behavior with intent to die
- Can lead to injury or serious medical consequences
- Degree of planning and intent may influence medical outcomes

B. **Distinguished from Nonsuicidal Self-Injury:**
- Not repeated (at least five times within the past 12 months) for relief/mood state
- Not initiated during delirium or confusion

C. **Diagnostic Features:**
- Essential manifestation: suicide attempt with intent to die
- Determining degree of intent can be challenging
- Markers of risk: poor planning, recent discharge from inpatient care, etc.
- Environmental triggers: loss of loved ones, job loss, displacement from housing

D. **Suicide Attempt vs. Attempted Recovery:**
- Act must not be dissuaded or changed before initiation
- Diagnosis should not be made if behavior stopped by another person

E. **Cultural Differences:**
- Variability in frequency, form, and lethality of attempts across cultures
- Cultural differences may impact method availability or presence of specific syndromes

F. **Medical Consequences:**
- Laboratory abnormalities: anemia, hypotension, shock, electrolyte imbalances
- Physical conditions: lacerations, skeletal trauma, cardiopulmonary instability, inhalation of vomit and suffocation, hepatic failure

G. **Comorbid Conditions:**
- Most commonly associated with bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders (panic disorders, PTSD flashbacks), substance use disorders (alcohol use disorders), borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, eating disorders, and adjustment disorders.

#### Nonsuicidal Self-Injury

**Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI)**

**Criteria for Diagnosis**:
- In the last year, intentionally self-inflicted damage on body to induce bleeding, bruising, or pain (e.g., cutting, burning, stabbing)
  - Without suicidal intent
    * Absence of suicidal intent can be inferred or stated by individual
    * Repeated behavior not likely to result in death
- Behavior has one or more of the following expectations:
  1. Relieve negative feelings or cognitive states
  2. Resolve interpersonal difficulties
  3. Induce positive feeling state
- Intended self-injury associated with at least one of the following:
  1. Interpersonal difficulties, negative feelings, or thoughts (e.g., depression, anxiety)
  2. Preoccupation with intended behavior before acting
  3. Frequent thinking about self-injury, even when not acted upon
- Not socially sanctioned or restricted to picking a scab or nail biting
- Clinically significant distress or interference in functioning
- Not exclusive to psychotic episodes, substance intoxication/withdrawal, neurodevelopmental disorders, or other mental disorders/medical conditions

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Repeatedly inflicting shallow injuries on body to reduce negative emotions and/or resolve interpersonal difficulties
  - Purpose is to obtain relief from tension, anxiety, self-reproach, etc.
- May feel a sense of urgency and craving, resulting in addiction-like behavior pattern
- Injuries most often inflicted with sharp objects (knife, needle, razor) on frontal thighs or dorsal forearm
  - Superficial cuts with visible scars
  - Other methods: burning skin with eraser, stabbing upper arm with needle/sharp knife
- Engagement in multiple self-injury methods associated with more severe psychopathology

**Prevalence and Course**:
- Starts in early teen years, can continue for many years
- Peak hospital admission at 20-29 years old, then declines
- Often learned from others on unit or observation
- Young children may experiment but not experience relief

**Theories of Psychopathology**:
1. **Learning theory**: Positive reinforcement (punishing self, generating attention) or negative reinforcement (affect regulation, reducing unpleasant emotions) sustains behavior
2. **Self-punishment**: NSSI as a form of self-punishment for acts causing distress or harm to others

**Differential Diagnosis: Nonsuicidal Self-Injury vs. Other Disorders**

**Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD):**
- Historically associated with nonsuicidal self-injury, but not invariably present
- Distinguishing features: disrupted aggressive and hostile behaviors vs. phases of closeness, collaborative behaviors, positive relationships
- Differences at fundamental level: involvement of neurotransmitter systems

**Suicidal Behavior Disorder:**
- Differentiation based on stated goal of behavior (wish to die) or relief in nonsuicidal self-injury
- Individuals may report false intent, learned that behavior is benign in short term
- Important to check history of suicidal behavior and mood changes
- High likelihood of suicide among those with a history of nonsuicidal self-injury

**Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder):**
- Injurious behavior confined to pulling out one's own hair, usually from scalp, eyebrows or eyelashes
- Occurs during relaxation or distraction

**Stereotypic Self-Injury:**
- Associated with intense concentration or low external stimulation
- Might be associated with developmental delay

**Excoriation Disorder (Skin Picking):**
- Mostly occurs in females, directed at an unsightly area of the skin, often face or scalp
- Preceded by an urge and experienced as pleasurable despite self-harm.
