# Brain Energy: Christopher M Palmer

> We are in the midst of a global mental health crisis, and mental illnesses are on the rise. But what causes mental illness? And why are mental health problems so hard to treat? Drawing on decades of research, Harvard psychiatrist Dr. Chris Palmer outlines a revolutionary new understanding that for the first time unites our existing knowledge about mental illness within a single framework: Mental disorders are metabolic disorders of the brain. 
> 
> Brain Energy explains this new understanding of mental illness in detail, from symptoms and risk factors to what is happening in brain cells. Palmer also sheds light on the new treatment pathways this theory opens up—which apply to all mental disorders, including anxiety, depression, ADHD, alcoholism, eating disorders, bipolar disorder, autism, and even schizophrenia. Brain Energy pairs cutting-edge science with practical advice and strategies to help people reclaim their mental health.
> 
> This groundbreaking book reveals: 
> - Why classifying mental disorders as "separate" conditions is misleading
> -  The clear connections between mental illness and disorders linked to metabolism, including diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, pain disorders, obesity, Alzheimer's disease, and epilepsy
> -  The link between metabolism and every factor known to play a role in mental health, including genetics, inflammation, hormones, neurotransmitters, sleep, stress, and trauma
> -  The evidence that current mental health treatments, including both medications and therapies, likely work by affecting metabolism
> -  New treatments available today that readers can use to promote long-term healing
> 
>  Palmer puts together the pieces of the mental illness puzzle to provide answers and offer hope. Brain Energy will transform the field of mental health, and the lives of countless people around the world.

#### Metabolism and Mitochondria: The Key to Understanding Mental Illness

**Understanding Mental Disorders: A New Perspective**

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Mental disorders are not distinct entities**: Overlapping symptoms exist between various disorders like depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc. Many individuals are diagnosed with multiple mental disorders.
- **Connections between mental and physical disorders**: Explored connections between mental illnesses and conditions such as obesity, diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, pain disorders, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, etc.
- **Mental disorders are metabolic disorders of the brain:** Mental states, even normal ones, relate to metabolism; all known contributing factors impact metabolism and mitochondria.

**Metabolism and Mitochondria:**
- Key to understanding mental illness: Simple explanation with focus on mitochondria's role in metabolism.
- Normal mental states vs. mental disorders: Anxiety, depression, fear are normal but become problematic when occurring at wrong times or excessively.

**Mechanisms of Action:**
- Five broad mechanisms explained to understand clinical and neuroscientific observations in all mental disorders.

**Contributing Factors:**
- Genetics, inflammation, neurotransmitters, hormones, sleep, alcohol and drugs, love, heartbreak, meaning and purpose in life, trauma, loneliness, etc., linked to effects on metabolism and mitochondria.

**Current Treatments:**
- Psychological, social treatments may affect metabolism for healing rather than just symptom reduction.

**New Understanding:**
- Offers long-elusive answers and new solutions for mental illness treatment.
- Integrates existing biological, psychological, and social research into one unifying framework.

## Part I: Connecting the Dots 
### Chapter 1: What We’re Doing Isn’t Working: Mental Health Today

**Mental Health Statistics**

**Prevalence of Mental Disorders (2017)**
- Nearly 800 million people (10% of global population) suffered from mental health disorders
- Anxiety disorders affected about 3.8% of the world's population
- Depression affected about 3.4% of the world's population
- When substance use disorders are included, the number rises to 970 million people (13% of global population)

**Mental Health Statistics in the United States**
- Approximately 20% or one in five people diagnosed with a mental disorder
- Lifetime prevalence rates are much higher, with about 50% of the US population expected to meet criteria for a mental disorder at some point in their lives
- Mental illness rates are on the rise in the United States

**Challenges in Estimating Prevalence Rates**
- People often deny or minimize mental health problems due to stigma and shame
- Societal perceptions of certain disorders vary (e.g., psychotic disorders, substance use disorders)
- Stigma can lead to underreporting and underdiagnosis
- Data on mental health disorders is complex and difficult to obtain accurately

**Rising Rates of Specific Disorders in the United States**
- ADHD: Increasing 41% from 2003 to 2012 among children four through seventeen
- Depression: Increased by 68% in children ages twelve to seventeen and 49% in adults eighteen to twenty-five between 2006 and 2017
- Burnout: Not an official DSM diagnosis, but prevalence estimated at 23% among US employees based on a Gallup poll (higher than depression rates)
- Suicide: Increasing across most age groups in the United States with nearly 45,000 deaths in 2016 and over one million reported suicide attempts per year.

**Conclusion**: Mental health disorders remain widespread, and prevalence statistics may be underestimates due to stigma and other factors. The rates of specific mental health issues, such as ADHD, depression, burnout, and suicide, are increasing in the United States. Addressing these challenges requires continued efforts to destigmatize mental illnesses and improve access to accurate information and effective treatment.

#### Increasing Mental Disorders: Understanding the Rise and Controversial Explanations

**Mental Disorders: Increasing Rates and Theories**

**Anxiety Disorders**:
- More than doubled between 1999 and 2017
- Criteria for diagnosing evolve, making assessment difficult
- Some argue rates have not changed in recent years
- Annual household survey suggests increase from 2008 to 2018:
    - 30% overall
    - 84% for ages 18-25

**Serious Mental Illness**:
- Includes severe forms of depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, etc.
- Increasing at an alarming rate:
    - 21% increase between 2008 and 2017 for those over 18
    - 100% doubling for ages 18-25 during the same period

**Autism**:
- Prevalence increased from 1 in 150 to 1 in 59 between 2000 and 2014

**Bipolar Disorder**:
- Prevalence increased from 0.4% to 7% between mid-1970s and early 2000s
- Increasingly common in children and adolescents

**Theories on Increasing Mental Illness Rates**:
1. **Pharmaceutical Companies**: Trying to sell pills, leading to overdiagnosis
2. **Laziness**: People want quick fixes, lack resilience
3. **New Generation of Kids**: Pampered, lack discipline and perseverance

**Conclusion**:
- Assumptions about the causes of increasing mental illness rates are often oversimplified
- Real people behind statistics suffer from very real issues

#### Rising Mental Disorders: Causes and Societal Costs

**Theories About the Increasing Rates of Mental Disorders (Second Category)**
- **Good thing:**
  - Reflects a broader understanding of mental disorders
  - More awareness and identification
  - Programs in schools, work environments to recognize symptoms
  - Public service campaigns on suicide prevention
  - Celebrities speaking out about their struggles
  - Increased media coverage and reduced stigma
- **Society:**
  - Increasing dependence on technology and screens
  - Sedentary and isolated behavior
  - Unrealistic expectations from social media
  - Faster pace of life with busy schedules
  - Lack of real-life connection
- **Toxins, chemicals, and fake food:**
  - Exposure to toxins in everyday life
  - Artificial ingredients in food
  - New chemicals in personal care products and environment
  - Unknown effects on health, including mental disorders

**Additional Theories (Second Category)**
- **Genetics:** Mutations leading to various disorders
- **Trauma:** Impact on mental health and disorders
- **Lack of sleep:** Role in mental disorder development
- **Diet:** Link between food choices and mental health
- **Environment:** Effects on mental wellbeing

**Costs of Mental Disorders (Third Category)**
- Financial toll: $2.5 trillion in 2010, expected to reach $6 trillion by 2030
  - Direct costs: healthcare services and medications
  - Indirect costs: lost productivity due to mental health issues
- Human suffering: misery, despair, ruined lives, social isolation, family chaos, domestic violence, homelessness, suicide

**Mental Disorders and the COVID-19 Pandemic (Fourth Category)**
- Increased rates of mental health struggles: 40% of US adults reporting issues in June 2020
- Financial costs to society: estimated $6 trillion by 2030.

#### Treatment Efficacy in Depression: Mixed Results and Persistent Symptoms

**Mental Health Suffering**

**Understanding Mental Disorders**:
- People suffer alone in silence due to shame, lack of knowledge about symptoms, and belief that suffering is natural or unchangeable
- Example: Woman named "Mary" with a history of abuse and depression

**Importance of Treatment**:
- Can reduce suffering, prevent disability, restore dreams and potential, save lives
- Success stories exist, e.g., John's recovery from severe depression and anxiety

**Challenges in Mental Health Treatment**:
- Not effective for everyone or all the time
- Depression as a chronic, episodic illness:
  - Only 10% of treated individuals fully recover
  - Average of 59% symptom presence over 12 years

**Conclusion**:
- Mental health treatment is crucial, but its effectiveness is limited. Not every patient will achieve a full and lasting recovery.

#### Treatment Resistance and Mental Illness: The Search for a Cure

**Mental Health Treatment Effectiveness**

**Depression:**
- Almost two-thirds of depressed patients don't experience remission
- Many suffer for years despite trying various treatments: medications, psychotherapy, group therapy, meditation, stress management, TMS, ECT
- Lack of long-term success with current treatments

**Other Mental Disorders:**
- OCD, autism, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia - Treatment success and chronicity similar to depression
- Many patients told they have lifelong disorders, lower expectations

**Implications:**
- Frustration among patients due to ineffective treatments
- Stigma and shame for those with mental disorders if they don't get better
- Importance of seeking help despite treatment limitations
- Encourage research on new solutions instead of relying solely on current methods.

**Mental Health Research:**
- Large financial investment in mental health research (NIH $3.2 billion)
- Lack of significant progress: no reduction in suicide, hospitalizations, or improvement for millions with mental illness
- Call for answering the question: "What causes mental illness?"

**Dr. Tom Insel's Assessment:**
- Failed to move the needle in reducing suicide, hospitalizations, or recovery for those with mental illness despite spending $20 billion on research.

### Chapter 2: What Causes Mental Illness and Why Does It Matter?

**What Causes Mental Illness and Why Does It Matter?**

**Ancient Theories**:
- Mental illnesses were largely thought to be caused by supernatural forces
- Punishment from God was a common belief
- Demonic possession and exorcism were treatment choices

**Modern Approaches**:
- Mental illness as a medical disorder was born
- **Hippocrates**: Postulated mental illnesses could be due to an imbalance of vital fluids (humors)
- **Freud**: Viewed mental disorders as due to unconscious desires or conflicts
- **Biopsychosocial Model**: Biological, psychological, and social factors contribute to mental illness
- **Diathesis-Stress Model**: A biological predisposition with environmental stress as the trigger

**Risk Factors**:
- Trauma, drug/alcohol use, hormonal issues, family history of mental illness, etc.
- However, these factors do not guarantee the development of a specific disorder
- Example: PTSD - trauma alone does not cause it, but it is a risk factor

**Mental Illness and Depression**:
- Mild depression is normal, but major depression requires more in-depth analysis
- Major depression involves sadness/depression most of the time with other symptoms like fatigue and disrupted sleep.

#### The Multifaceted Causes and Debated Theories of Major Depression

**Major Depression: Causes and Theories**

**Symptoms**:
- Robbing of ability to experience pleasure and enjoyment from life
- Overwhelming feelings of hopelessness, even suicidal thoughts
- At least 5 symptoms for 2 weeks required for diagnosis

**Risk Factors**:
- **Genetics/family history**
- **Stress**, loss of loved ones, relationship conflict
- **Hormonal issues**: low thyroid hormone, high cortisol, menstruation
- **Gender**: women are more susceptible
- **Substance abuse** and certain medications
- **Social issues**: bullying, loneliness, poverty
- **Physical illnesses**: chronic pain, diabetes, heart disease, arthritis
- **Cancer**: pancreatic cancer may precede depression
- **Neurological disorders**: strokes, MS, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, epilepsy
- Other psychiatric disorders: anxiety, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder

**Theories**:
- **Chemical Imbalance Theory**: neurotransmitter imbalance causes depression
  * Serotonin levels may be low in some cases
  * Questions raised: cause of chemical imbalance, inconsistent treatment effects
- **Learned Helplessness Theory**: powerlessness leads to depression
  * People give up after facing adverse circumstances.

#### Causes and Treatments of Major Depression: An Overview

**Major Depression: Causes and Treatments**

**Treatment Approach:**
- Based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
- Identify and change thoughts, emotions, behaviors
- Belief that people become clinically depressed due to thoughts influenced by past helplessness
- Empower patients to challenge negative thoughts
- Replace with less dire and hopeless ones
- Reinforces positive cycle

**Theories about Causes:**
- Biological: antidepressants target neurotransmitters, serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine
- Psychological: relationships, thoughts, feelings, behaviors
- Social factors also contribute

**Treatment Options:**
1. **Medications**: antidepressants, anxiety medications, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, stimulants, antiepileptic medications, hormones, vitamins, supplements like St. John's wort
2. **Psychotherapy**: relationship focused, thoughts and feelings, behaviors; present or past focus
3. More aggressive treatments: TMS, ECT, surgery (brain or vagus nerve stimulation)

**Variability in Treatments:**
- Doesn't work for all people with depression
- Different causes for different individuals
- Some people do not receive treatment despite symptoms persisting

**Physical Changes Associated with Major Depression:**
1. Inflammation: higher levels of inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein and interleukins
2. Brain changes: atrophy or shrinkage of specific brain regions, potentially neurodegenerative disorder

**Brain Changes and Inflammation:**
- Inflammation may cause depression or be a result of it
- Not everyone with chronic depression experiences inflammation consistently
- Research ongoing to determine the relationship between the two.

#### Understanding the Causes and Symptoms of Major Depression: A Biopsychosocial Approach

**Major Depression: Understanding Causes and Brain Changes**

**Biopsychosocial Model of Major Depression:**
- Many causes: biological, psychological, social factors
- No single cause for all cases
- Different types or clusters of symptoms may exist

**Risk Factors (Biological):**
- Altered brain activity and communication in depressed individuals
- Brain changes found through functional MRI scans
- Decreased activity in some regions, increased activity in others
- Limitations: relative differences between groups, cause or consequence unclear

**Risk Factors (Psychological):**
- Social stressors and psychological factors contribute to depression
- Symptoms may vary among individuals
- Struggle for decades to identify causes

**Gut Microbiome:**
- Emerging role in various disorders, including depression and anxiety
- Play a role in producing hormones, neurotransmitters, and inflammatory molecules
- Research is still ongoing on specific organisms and their impact on mental health

**Importance of Identifying Causes:**
- Syndromes: clusters of signs and symptoms with unknown causes
- Diagnosis based on symptoms reported by patients (subjective experiences)
- No objective tests or laboratory diagnoses for mental disorders
- Unifying theory needed to connect all evidence in a logical and plausible way.

#### Circular Reasoning in Mental Health: Misinterpreting Causes and Treatments

**The Challenge of Mental Health Care: A Syndrome Approach**

**Background:**
- Medical example of AIDS as a syndrome before its identification as a virus
- Psychiatry's reliance on syndrome diagnosis

**Diagnosis Exclusion:**
- Neurological illnesses, cancers, infections, autoimmune diseases can affect the brain but are not psychiatric disorders
- Mental symptoms from these conditions are not necessarily diagnosed as psychiatric disorders

**Progress in Mental Health Care:**
- Lack of clear cause hinders progress
- Treatments focus on symptoms rather than root causes

**Treatment Models:**
1. **Disease-modifying treatments**: Address the root cause, cure illness
2. **Symptomatic treatments**: Reduce symptoms, do not change course of illness

**Mental Health Field Applications:**
- Most psychiatric treatments are symptomatic
- Medications, ECT, TMS: Reduce symptoms but don't address root cause for some individuals
- Psychotherapy and social interventions: Addressing some root causes but not others

**Circular Logic in Mental Health Field:**
- Misconceptions about causes of mental illness based on symptom relief or treatment effects
- Flawed reasoning from fever example: Fever caused by brain disorder, Tylenol affects the brain as well

**Conclusion:**
- Proper understanding of mental illness causes is essential for effective treatments addressing root cause.

#### Identifying Common Pathways vs Cause-and-Effect in Mental Illness Research

**Correlations, Causes, and Common Pathways**

**Determining the Cause of an Illness**
- Correlational research looks for relationships between variables (correlations) to identify potential causes
- Examples: brain scans identifying inflammation in individuals with depression, epidemiology studies examining heart attacks and obesity
- Correlation does not necessarily imply causation
- Misinterpreting correlational studies can lead to incorrect assumptions about cause and effect relationships

**Understanding the Cause of Illness**
- Complications arise when trying to define the cause of complex conditions like mental illness
- Multiple risk factors contribute to various illnesses, including genetics, lifestyle choices, environmental factors, etc.
- Correlations can reveal common pathways or root causes

**Correlation vs. Cause and Effect**
- Correlations may indicate a relationship between two variables (causation or consequence)
- Correlational studies do not definitively establish cause-and-effect relationships
- Misinterpreting correlations can lead to misunderstandings about the nature of causality in research findings

**Common Pathways and Root Causes**
- Correlations can reveal shared mechanisms underlying various symptoms or conditions
- Understanding these common pathways is essential for developing effective interventions and treatments
- Example: runny noses and sore throats could be caused by several factors, including the cold virus, allergies, etc.

#### Understanding Common Pathways Behind Symptom Comorbidities

**Research on Runny Noses and Sore Throats**

**Background:**
- Difficulty distinguishing runny noses from allergies vs. colds based on symptoms alone
- Researchers must identify common pathways or root causes to understand the disorders

**Symptom Clusters**:
- Runny Nose Disorder
- Sore Throat Disorder

**Characteristics**:
- Different treatments (Tylenol vs. pseudoephedrine)
- Comorbidity is common, bidirectional relationship

**Common Pathway**:
- Inflammation as a result of immune system activation

**Potential Diagnoses:**
- Tylenol deficiency disorder for sore throat group
- Pseudoephedrine deficiency disorder for runny nose group

**Root Causes**:
- Cold virus or allergies (different root causes, same symptoms)
- Inflammation as a common pathway

**Simplification of Explanation:**
- Identifying common pathways or root causes simplifies diagnosis and treatment
- Occam's razor: simpler explanations are more likely to be true.

#### Understanding Causation in Mental Illness: From Correlation to Cascade Effects

**Mental Health and Causation of Mental Disorders:**

**Understanding the Complexity**
- Mental illness: defined by symptoms, varying degrees and preexisting conditions
- Differences in responses to same cause (flu virus)
  - Healthy individual vs. person with asthma or advanced age
- Importance of understanding physiology for effective treatments

**Challenges in Proving Causation:**
- Mental health field deals with syndromes and symptomatic treatments
- Ethical concerns: unethical to expose people to causes of serious/life-threatening disorders
- Use of animal research and scientific theories

**Proving Causation through Research:**
- Randomized controlled trials: proving cause-effect relationship (cold virus causing runny nose)
  - Challenges in human studies for serious disorders
- Studying risk factors and looking for evidence of cascade events leading to mental illness.

**Current State of Research:**
- No definitive proof of causation of mental disorders
- Evidence gathered but not put together (what this book aims to do).

### Chapter 3: Searching for a Common Pathway

**Chapter 3: Searching for a Common Pathway**

**Defining Mental Illness:**
- Involves changes or abnormalities in emotions, cognition, motivation, and behaviors
- Resulting in distress or problems functioning in life
- Context, duration, and appropriateness are essential factors

**Normal vs. Abnormal:**
- Symptoms of mental illness can resemble normal emotions under certain circumstances
- Intensity, duration, and impact on daily function determine whether it is an illness
- Controversies exist regarding depression diagnosis in the context of grief or stressful life events

**DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual):**
- Defines mental disorders with clear criteria
- Diagnostic labels important for clinical care, research, funding, and treatment development
- Debates over how to diagnose mental disorders due to lack of objective tests

**Bereavement Exception in DSM:**
- Removed from DSM-5 after controversy
- Clinicians previously held off on diagnosing depression during bereavement period
- Controversy: Should clinicians offer support or medication treatment?

**Distinctions between Mental Disorders:**
- Some distinctions are obvious (e.g., schizophrenia vs. anxiety disorder)
- Diagnostic labels crucial for clinical care, research funding, and treatment development

**Importance of Diagnostic Labels:**
- Inform treatment plans
- Understand different treatment options
- Discontinue treatments after a defined period of time (e.g., John's case)
- Critical for FDA approval of medications and psychotherapy studies.

#### Mental Disorder Complexities: Heterogeneity, Comorbidity, and Diagnostic Challenges

**Heterogeneity and Comorbidity in Mental Health:**
- **Heterogeneity**: People diagnosed with same disorder have varying symptoms, severity, impact on functioning, and courses of illness
- Examples:
  - Major Depression: Different symptom presentations (depressed mood vs. excessive sleep), different approaches to treatment (sleeping pills for one, not for another)
  - Anxiety and depression: Overlapping diagnoses, common treatments

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- Lack of understanding and poor treatment outcomes in mental health field due to heterogeneity
- Calls for rethinking diagnostic criteria for major depression (e.g., inclusion of anxiety, irritability, pain)

**Comorbidity**:
- About half of people diagnosed with a mental disorder have more than one disorder simultaneously
- Examples: Major depression and anxiety, anxiety disorders and major depression
- Common treatments overlap (antidepressants for both depression and anxiety)

**Diagnosis Changes Over Time:**
- Symptoms can morph into different disorders, complicating treatment and diagnosis
- Example: Mike's case - ADHD > Social Anxiety Disorder > Major Depression > Bipolar Disorder > Schizoaffective Disorder > OCD > Opioid Addiction.

#### Overlapping Biological Mechanisms in Psychotic Disorders

**Mike's Diagnoses**
- Schizoaffective disorder
- Opioid use disorder
- Nicotine use disorder
- OCD
- Social anxiety disorder
- Previous diagnoses: ADHD, major depression, bipolar disorder, Asperger’s syndrome

**Questions Raised by Mike's Case**
- Why do people with mental disorders often have multiple diagnoses?
- Do some psychiatric disorders lead to others?
- Are different disorders merely different symptoms or phases of the same underlying problem?
- Is there a common pathway for mental disorders, despite varying symptoms and treatments?

**Research on Psychotic Disorders: Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Disorder**
- **Schizophrenia**: Chronic psychotic symptoms like hallucinations or paranoia.
- **Bipolar Disorder**: Primary mood symptoms—manic and depressive episodes; psychotic symptoms during manic or depressive episodes.
- **Schizoaffective Disorder**: Combination of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder's symptoms.
- Researchers studied these disorders using the Bipolar Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) study, including over 2,400 people:
    - No significant differences found between diagnostic groups in terms of brain scans, genetic testing, EEGs, blood parameters, inflammation levels, or cognitive performance tests.
- Overlap in symptoms and treatments:
    - Negative symptoms in schizophrenia overlap with depression symptoms
    - Mood stabilizers used for bipolar disorder are frequently prescribed to people diagnosed with schizophrenia (despite the absence of significant mood symptoms)
    - Antidepressants commonly used in both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

#### Overlap and Co-occurrence of Mental Disorders: A Comprehensive Analysis

**Mental Health Disorders: Overlaps and Spectrum of Symptoms**

**Antipsychotic Medications**:
- Used for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and schizoaffective disorder
- Treat all symptoms of these disorders
- FDA approved as "antipsychotics" and "mood stabilizers" for bipolar disorder

**Symptoms Overlap**:
- Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorder may be the same illness on a spectrum of symptoms
- Major depression and anxiety disorders also have overlapping symptoms

**Bipolar Disorder vs. Schizophrenia**:
- Differences in symptom presentation
- Bipolar: Many people never experience psychotic symptoms or hospitalization, can function well
- Schizophrenia: Severe impairment, high rates of disability
- Symptomatically ill 47% of the time despite treatment for bipolar disorder

**Possible Explanation**:
- Multiple psychosis-causing disease processes with different biological pathways can lead to similar symptoms
- Fever as a symptom has one clear biological pathway (inflammation)

**Diagnostic Overlap**:
- Anxiety symptoms common across various mental diagnoses
- 26% of Americans meet criteria for at least one mental disorder in last twelve months
- 55% had only one diagnosis, 22% had two, and rest had three or more

**Autism Spectrum Disorder**:
- 70% have at least one other mental disorder, almost 50% have two or more
- Embedded criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
- Longer term risk of developing additional mental disorders unknown.

#### Common Pathway for Mental Disorders: The p-Factor

**Autism Spectrum Disorder and Mental Health Disorders**
- Autism impairs social skills, increasing risk for mental disorders
- Autism puts people at higher risk for various mental disorders
  - Mood disorders
  - Psychotic disorders
  - Behavioral disorders
  - Eating disorders
  - Substance use disorders
- Stress is a factor in developing mental disorders, but the relationship is complex
- Bidirectional relationships between mental disorders and eating disorders
  - Eating disorders increase risk for other mental disorders
  - Mental disorders increase risk for eating disorders
- Similar bidirectional relationships exist between all mental disorders
- Study on Danish health registry showed that any mental disorder dramatically increases chance of developing another mental disorder
- Strong correlations found among all mental disorders and their risk factors
- Possible existence of a common pathway (p-factor) to all mental illnesses.

**Additional Information**
- Dr. Benjamin Lahey et al., studied the symptoms and prognosis of eleven different mental disorders, finding tremendous overlap and possibility of "general factor" leading to all of them
- Avshalom Caspi and Terrie Moffitt reviewed research on epidemiological studies, brain imaging studies, and studies of risk factors for mental disorders, concluding strong correlations among all mental disorders.

### Chapter 4: Could It All Be Related?

**Relationship Between Mental Disorders and Metabolic/Neurological Conditions**

**Common Pathway:**
- Bidirectional relationships exist between mental disorders and various metabolic and neurological conditions
- Both mental symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) and physical symptoms can coexist
- Overlooked in clinical settings as normal reactions to diseases or underlying disorders

**Metabolic Disorders:**
- Obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease
- Strong association with mental illness
  * People with schizophrenia: three times more likely to develop diabetes
  * People diagnosed with depression: 60% more likely to develop diabetes
  * Depression affects blood sugar levels in diabetics
  * Higher rates of mood disorders, suicide attempts, psychiatrist visits among adolescents with diabetes
- Obesity and mental illness connection is complex
  * People with mental disorders are more likely to be overweight or obese
    * Schizophrenia: 50% increase in obesity after twenty years
    * Autism: 40% higher risk of obesity
  * Obesity may contribute to mental illness development, not just treatments causing weight gain.

**Diabetes:**
- Historical connection between diabetes and mental illness since the late 1800s
- Increased risk for people with mental disorders to develop diabetes
  * Schizophrenia: three times more likely
  * Depression: 60% higher risk
- Depression has a negative impact on blood sugar levels in diabetics
- Higher rates of depression among people with diabetes (one in four)

**Obesity:**
- Mental disorders increase the likelihood of obesity development
  * ADHD: even those not taking stimulants have higher obesity risk compared to non-ADHD individuals
- People with obesity are at increased risk for mental illness

**Cardiovascular Disease:**
- Further research needed on relationship between cardiovascular disease and mental disorders.

#### Mental Disorders and Associated Physical Conditions

**Obesity and Mental Disorders:**
* Obese individuals are 25% more likely to develop depression or anxiety disorders
* 50% higher risk for bipolar disorder
* Weight gain during puberty increases risk of depression by fourfold
* Obesity affects brain function, leading to mental disorders

**Cardiovascular Diseases:**
* Depression increases risk of heart attack by 50-100% for those without a history
* Depression doubles chances of another heart attack in those who have already had one
* Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder linked to premature cardiovascular disease
* PTSD patients twice as likely to have transient ischemic attacks, 62% more likely to have a stroke

**Mental Disorders and Early Death:**
* Mentally ill people die an average of 13-30 years younger than expected
* Suicide not the primary cause; most early deaths due to heart attacks, strokes, and diabetes
* All mental disorders associated with shortened lifespans

**Neurological Disorders:**
* Neurological disorders affect brain function objectively
* Alzheimer's disease is most common form of dementia
* Risk factors: age, family history, head trauma, metabolic disorders, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, smoking, high blood pressure, low exercise.

**Alzheimer's Disease:**
* Most common form of dementia
* Symptoms: memory disturbances, personality changes, compromised judgment
* Hallmark findings: plaques and tangles in the brain
* Risk factors: age (doubles every five years after 65), family history, head trauma, metabolic disorders (obesity, diabetes, heart disease), smoking, high blood pressure, low exercise.

**Obesity as a Risk Factor for Alzheimer's:**
* Obesity in midlife increases risk of developing Alzheimer's disease
* Diabetes and heart disease also raise the risk
* APOE4 gene variant linked to early onset Alzheimer's.

#### Bidirectional Relationships Between Mental Disorders and Medical Conditions

**Alzheimer's Disease and Psychiatric Disorders**
- Study on Danish population found bidirectional relationships between various psychiatric disorders and Alzheimer's disease (organic mental disorder)
- Alzheimer's was included under organic mental disorders, which also include delirium and other dementias
- Every psychiatric disorder increased chances of developing an organic mental disorder: 50% to twentyfold
- Signs of Alzheimer's often begin with forgetfulness and "mental" symptoms (depression, anxiety, personality changes)
- Almost all patients with Alzheimer's develop psychiatric symptoms (97%)
- Common psychotic symptoms include hallucinations and delusions

**Epilepsy and Psychiatric Disorders**
- Epilepsy has a bidirectional relationship with mental disorders
- Can begin at any age, most often in childhood (1 in 150 children)
- Causes: brain abnormalities or unknown
- People with epilepsy more likely to experience mental symptoms even when not seizing
- Anxiety disorders common, three to sixfold higher rate than general population
- Depression high prevalence, one-third of all epileptics reported suicide attempts
- Suicide attempts often occurred before diagnosis
- Children with autism have a 16% chance of developing seizures
- ADHD children have a 16% chance of showing signs on EEGs
- Epileptic children more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD (two and a half times)
- Major depression increases chances of having unprovoked seizure sixfold
- Relationship between epilepsy and metabolic disorders: hypoglycemia can cause seizures, but people with diabetes are also more likely to have epilepsy

**Common Pathway**
- Bidirectional relationships suggest a possible common pathway for all these disorders
- Some believe the connection is due to stigma around mental and metabolic disorders.

#### Metabolism and Mental Health: Bridging the Gap

**Misconceptions about Mental Disorders and Metabolic Conditions**

**Neglect and Self-Destructive Behaviors:**
- Many believe mental disorders lead to negligence and poor self-care (depression, obesity, diabetes)
- Overwhelming stress contributes to unhealthy habits (lack of motivation, energy)

**The Conundrum:**
- Rates of mental disorders, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease have been skyrocketing over the past 50 years
- Why is this? What causes an "epidemic of laziness" or lack of self-discipline?

**Possible Causes:**
1. Society: faster pace of life, constant distractions (emails, social media)
2. Food supply: artificial ingredients, processed foods

**The Missing Link:**
- Inertia and lack of motivation may be symptoms of a metabolic problem rather than excuses for laziness or poor health behaviors
- People with mental disorders often don't have enough energy due to deficits in energy production inside cells (metabolic issues)
- Metabolism ties together various aspects of different disorders, such as risk factors, symptoms, and treatments.

**Mental Disorders as Metabolic Disorders:**
1. All mental disorders lead to a greater probability of developing other mental disorders
2. Mental disorders have bidirectional relationships with obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and other metabolic conditions
3. Metabolism is the underlying common thread that explains causes, symptoms, and overlaps among these disorders. (Part Two will further explore this idea)

## Part II: Brain Energy 
### Chapter 5: Mental Disorders Are Metabolic Disorders

**Mental Disorders as Metabolic Disorders**

**Theoretical Perspective**:
- New theories should build upon existing knowledge
- The theory of brain energy suggests mental disorders are metabolic disorders of the brain

**Implications for Mental Health Professionals**:
- Incorporates biological, psychological, and social perspectives
- Offers new insights and potential treatments

**Integration of Medical Disciplines**:
- Connects psychiatry, neurology, cardiology, endocrinology, and more
- Encourages better cross-specialty collaboration and comprehensive care

**Evidence for the Theory**:
1. Metabolic abnormalities found in mental disorders
2. Shared risk factors for mental and metabolic disorders
3. All symptoms of mental disorders tied to metabolism/mitochondria
4. Current treatments affect metabolism

**Metabolic Ripple Effect**:
- Obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's, epilepsy, and mental problems are interconnected
- Increased risk for various other illnesses not usually viewed as metabolic disorders

**Importance of the Theory**:
- Simplistic views on causes may be misleading
- Understanding mental disorders as metabolic disorders can lead to more effective treatments.

#### Understanding Metabolism and its Role in Health and Disease

**Metabolism and Medications**

**Mark's Experience**:
- Healthy, thin man developed multiple sclerosis (MS)
- Prescribed corticosteroid medication like prednisone
- Gained weight and developed pre-diabetes
- Struggled with cravings, lack of energy for exercise
- Developed cardiovascular risk factors and anxiety/depression
- Doctor's advice to "try yoga and diet" was unhelpful

**Corticosteroid Medications**:
- Known side effects include weight gain, high blood sugar, increased appetite, depression, anxiety
- Can cause metabolic disorders like diabetes and obesity
- Other medications can also cause these metabolic problems

**Metabolism Complexities**:
- Not avoidable through sheer willpower
- Altered levels of hormones or trauma history can lead to metabolic disorders
- Medications, environment, lifestyle factors all influence metabolism

**What is Metabolism?**:
- Process of turning food into energy or building blocks for cells
- Involves absorbing nutrients and managing waste products
- Determines cellular health, body/brain development, resource allocation
- Constantly adapting to environmental changes

**Energy Imbalances**:
- Problems with metabolism lead to energy imbalances in cells
- Affects all cells in the human body, including heart cells and pumping function.

#### Understanding Metabolic Basis of Brain Function and Mental Health Issues

**Brain Cells and Metabolic Control**

**Importance of Brain Function Precision**:
- Brain cells need precise control to be turned on/off at appropriate times
- Disruption of on/off processes can result in mental illness symptoms

**Number of Brain Cells**:
- Estimated 100 billion neurons and additional glial cells
- Some estimates suggest up to 806 billion total cells

**Neurotransmitters and Cell Signaling**:
- Neurotransmitters act as "go" or "stop" signals for cells
- Cells release neurotransmitters based on energy availability and other factors

**Brain Energy Requirements**:
- Brain uses about 20% of total body energy at rest
- Brain cells are sensitive to disruptions in energy supply

**Metabolic Disruptions and Brain Function**:
- Disruptions can cause various symptoms, from subtle to severe
- Severe cases can lead to heart attacks, strokes, or death due to cell failure

**Chronic Metabolic Conditions**:
- Diabetes as an energy shortage/deficit in insulin or cell responsiveness
- Cells have trouble converting glucose into energy, leading to impaired function

#### Understanding Mental Disorders through Metabolic Lens: Exploring Cellular Traffic Jams

**Diabetes and Metabolism:**

**Effect of Diabetes on the Body:**
- Affects various parts of the body
- Symptoms range from mild to severe
- Can impact eyes, nerves, brains, heart, kidneys, and ability to fight infections
- Progression varies based on metabolism

**Metabolism's Role in Diabetes:**
- Affects functioning of cells throughout the body
- Complex factor influenced by numerous elements
- Controlled at multiple levels

**Traffic Analogy for Understanding Metabolism:**
- Body is like a city with organized traffic flow
- Traffic jams represent issues in specific parts of the body or brain

**Factors Affecting Metabolism:**
- Diet, light, sleep, exercise, drugs and alcohol, genes, hormones, stress, neurotransmitters, inflammation, and more.

**Mental Disorders and Metabolism:**
- All mental disorders relate to metabolism as it affects cell function
- Solvable through straightforward interventions.

**Normal vs. Mental Disorder:**
- Difference not clearly defined in the mental health field
- Focuses on functioning of mind versus adverse states or symptoms.

### Chapter 6: Mental States and Mental Disorders

**Chapter 6: Mental States and Mental Disorders**

**Normal Human Emotions vs. Mental Disorders:**
- Distinguishing normal reactions from mental disorders important for treatment
- Both can lead to poor health outcomes
- Stressors cause mental illness when exposed to numerous or extreme stressors

**Understanding Normal: Stress and the Stress Response**

**Stressors**: psychological and social factors, interconnected with biological factors

**Human Connections**:
- We are meant to live in groups
- Seek attachment to others for safety and support

**Challenges with Human Connections:**
- People can be sources of psychological stress
- Stressors revolve around relationships, roles, resources, responsibilities
- Absence of humans (loneliness) is also a powerful stressor

**Stress Response**:
1. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis: cortisol flow
2. Sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axis: adrenaline (epinephrine and norepinephrine) flow
3. Inflammation
4. Changes in gene expression, especially hippocampus
- Metabolic toll: energy used to produce changes, less available for other functions
- High alert state: heart pumps faster, blood pressure increases, blood glucose rises.

#### The Impact of Adverse Childhood Experiences on Lifelong Health Outcomes

**Effects of Stress on Body and Mind:**
* Hormones flowing, inflammatory cytokines released
* Defense resources mobilized for body's protection
* Mild stress can be dealt with by resilient individuals (metabolically healthy)
* Extreme or prolonged stress can lead to mental and metabolic disorders
* Exacerbation of existing disorders: depression, alcoholism, schizophrenia, etc.

**Psychosomatic Medicine/Mind-Body Connection:**
* Field studying relationship between psychological factors and physical health
* Social determinants of health: poverty, abuse, high-crime neighborhoods
* Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) studies: correlation between early experiences and long-term health outcomes

**Impact of ACEs on Health:**
* Increased risk for physical inactivity, obesity, diabetes
* Higher rates of smoking, poor self-rated health, cancer, heart disease, respiratory diseases
* Greater likelihood of sexual risk-taking, mental health issues, alcohol use, drug use
* Victim or perpetrator of violence, problematic drug use, suicide attempts
* Shortened lifespan: twenty years less compared to those with no ACEs

**Biological Effects of Stress:**
* Diversion of resources to fight-or-flight system
* Impairment of body's ability to maintain itself (autophagy)
  - Inhibition by high cortisol levels
  - Waste disposal and maintenance process affected in various disorders
* Delayed protein synthesis: stress granules formation, associated with neurodegenerative disorders
* Sleep disruption: insomnia, crucial for both physical and mental health.

#### Understanding Mental Illness: A New Framework for Diagnosis

**Impact of Sleep Deprivation on Aging and Stress**

**Sleep Deprivation**:
- Prioritizes maintenance functions are compromised when people aren't sleeping well
- Leads to higher levels of cortisol, which can make the problem worse
- Results in premature aging

**Stress**:
- Plays a role in human health and takes a metabolic toll
- Uses energy that could be used for proper cell function and maintenance
- Can lead to physical and mental disorders or just plain old aging
- Stress reduction practices can help, but may not be sufficient for everyone
- Stress may not be the cause of mental illness in some cases

**New Definition of Mental Illness (RDoC)**:
- Focuses on symptoms rather than diagnostic labels
- Organizes symptoms into domains of functioning: emotion, cognition, motivation, social behavior
- Encourages exploration of these constructs without a focus on diagnostic criteria

**Brain Functions and Mental Illness**:
- Symptoms correspond to normal mental states or brain functions that are not working properly
- Includes emotions, cognition, behavior, and motivation
- Even bizarre symptoms like delusions and hallucinations can be tied to normal brain functions

#### "Normal" Brain Functions vs Disordered Responses: A Car Analogy for Mental Illness

**Normal Brain Functions vs. Mental Illness:**

**Overactive or Underactive Brain Functions:**
- **Panic attacks**: triggered for no clear reason, dysfunctional and maladaptive
- Memory impairment in dementia or lack of social skills in autism: brain functions fail to activate in the right situations

**Symptoms of Mental Illness:**
- Can seem unique and highly unusual
- Normal brain functions may perform at wrong times or with wrong intensity
- Can result in poor health outcomes

**Analogy: Three Cars**
1. **Car A**: living the good life, no health problems
2. **Car B**: living in harsh environment, more health problems, shorter lifespan
   - Adaptations help navigate difficult conditions
3. **Car C**: problem with the driver, not the car itself
4. **Prolonged or extreme stress**: can lead to a disorder
5. **Normal brain functions**: performing at wrong times or under wrong circumstances = disorder
6. **Societal factors**: changing environments or helping people cope is ideal
7. **Brains of people with mental disorders**: malfunctioning, doing things at the wrong times or with wrong intensity, or failing to do things they should be doing.
8. **Prolonged stress**: can result in adaptive strategies no longer working (overactive or underactive functions)
9. **The driver of Car C**: problem lies with the driver, not the car itself.

#### Understanding Pain as a Model for Mental Disorders

**Understanding Pain as a Neural System: A Human Example**

**Function and Dysfunction of Pain System**:
- Pain is controlled by neural pathways: pain receptors, spinal cord nerves, and brain regions
- Disorders in this system can be categorized into three types based on the function of the cells:
  - **Overactivity**: People experience pain more frequently or intensely than necessary (e.g., diabetic neuropathy)
  - **Underactivity**: People feel less pain than they should (e.g., reduced sensation in feet due to diabetes)
  - **Absence of function**: People feel no pain despite an injury or condition (e.g., spinal cord injuries or strokes)

**Chronic Pain Disorders**:
- Difficulty distinguishing normal pain from a disorder
- Pain can become chronic, severe, and unprovoked, leading to a diagnosis of a pain disorder

**Defining Mental Illness**:
- **Mental illness**: Brain not working properly over a period of time, resulting in mental symptoms that cause suffering or impairment in functioning.

**Components of the Definition**:
1. The brain is not working properly: Difficult to measure and assess with current technologies
2. This results in mental symptoms: Indicators of abnormal brain function
3. This malfunction occurs over a period of time: Cumulative effect of neural dysfunction
4. The symptoms cause suffering or impairment in functioning: Direct impact on the individual's quality of life

#### Underactive and Overactive Brain Functions in Mental Illness

**Symptoms of Mental Illness: Overactive Brain Functions**
- Hyperexcitability of brain cells and networks leads to mental disorder symptoms
- **Fear and anxiety**: Amygdala may malfunction, causing inappropriate or exaggerated responses
  - Symptoms: Fear at wrong times or intensity
  - Example: Phobias, panic attacks
- **Obsessions and compulsions**
  - Hyperexcited cells and networks in brain regions responsible for grooming and checking behaviors
  - Examples: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
- **Psychotic symptoms**
  - Hallucinations, delusions
  - Found in various mental and neurological disorders
  - Also common in people without diagnosed disorders.

#### Underactive and Overactive Brain Functions in Mental Disorders

**Understanding Psychotic Symptoms**
* Hyperexcitability of brain cells processing perceptions:
  * Auditory hallucinations due to hyperexcitable sound perception neurons
  * Neurosurgeons can induce hallucinations through electrode stimulation
  * Abnormalities in cortical interneuron function, leading to overactivity in targeted neurons
* Psychotic symptoms related to sleep systems:
  * Daytime hallucinations and delusions similar to dreams
  * Brain areas responsible for creating dreams may be hyperexcitable during psychosis
  * Capgras syndrome involves specific brain network overactivity/underactivity

**Underactive Brain Functions in Mental Disorders**
* Reduction in activity of certain neurons and brain networks:
  * ADHD: Locus coeruleus neurons for focus, planning, and attention
  * Cognitive impairment due to reduced neuron function for memory storage and retrieval
  * Depression: Default mode network responsible for emotional regulation
* Symptoms wax and wane with underactive brain functions

**Absence of Specific Brain Functions**
* Permanent changes in brain cells and connections:
  * Neurodevelopmental disorders (autism (missing or different neurons/connections))
  * Neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease, cell death leading to neuron loss)
  * Symptoms are always present and don't change over time for these cases
* Additional symptoms may wax and wane despite permanent brain changes.

**Multifaceted Brain Adaptations and Behavioral Disorders:**
* Complex responses involving multiple brain functions:
  * May not fit neatly into overactive, underactive, or absent categories.

#### Understanding Depression, Hypomania & Trauma Response in Mental Disorders

**Normal Responses and Mental Disorders:**
* Depression: normal reaction to stressors, adversities, or losses; can last for more than two weeks and involve changes in mood, energy, appetite, and sleep
* Hypomania: opposite of depression; feeling great or euphoric, increased energy, productivity, and less need for sleep; can be a normal response
* Trauma response: flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance of situations reminding of event, negative effects on mood and thinking, trouble sleeping, being on edge; common after major life traumas

**Behavioral Disorders:**
* Substance use disorders and eating disorders deserve special attention as they show strong relationship with all mental disorders
* Overactive or underactive brain functions may drive people to engage in these behaviors, leading to problems
* Some people may use substances or change eating habits to cope with symptoms of other mental disorders (self-medication hypothesis)
* People can be perfectly fine and start engaging in these behaviors due to peer pressure or other reasons
* Effects on metabolism and brain function can lead to overactivity and underactivity of specific brain functions, creating vicious cycles.

**Complexities of Mental Illness:**
* Findings about reduced default-mode network activity are not consistent across people with the same disorder or even in the same person at different times
* Symptoms wax and wane, making it difficult to identify causes and develop diagnostic tests
* Developmental abnormalities affect a wide range of cell types and brain regions in different people, adding complexity to understanding mental disorders.

### Chapter 7: Magnificent Mitochondria

**Mitochondria: The Drivers of Human Cells and Metabolism**

**Overview**:
- Mitochondria are the "powerhouses" of human cells, responsible for energy production through ATP creation
- They are more than just powerhouses; they play a crucial role in cellular functioning and human evolution

**Origin of Mitochondria**:
- Ancestral mitochondrion was a bacterium that evolved into an independent living organism between 1-4 billion years ago
- Around the same time, archaea (single-celled organisms) engulfed this ancestral mitochondrion, resulting in symbiosis and the formation of the first eukaryotic cell with a nucleus
- Over time, this symbiotic arrangement led to multicellular life

**Mitochondria's Role**:
- Mitochondria evolved into organelles responsible for energy production in eukaryotic cells
- In plants and algae, some mitochondria became chloroplasts that facilitate photosynthesis
- Both mitochondria and chloroplasts are descended from the same ancient bacterium
- This merger occurred only once in evolution, and all eukaryotes share these organelles

**Importance of Mitochondria**:
- Being first matters in evolution; common genes are considered more essential to life
- Evolution tends to eliminate traits that aren't necessary or advantageous for survival and reproduction
- New genes must develop alongside existing ones to adapt and coexist

#### The Essential Role and Functions of Mitochondria

**Mitochondria in Eukaryotic Cells**
- **Mitochondria**: First appeared in eukaryotic cells as a single bacterium and an outside cell
- Over time, nucleus and other organelles developed
- Mitochondria likely influenced development of other cell parts and became indispensable
- Modern Mitochondria
  - Can't replicate themselves outside of eukaryotic cells
  - Most mitochondrial DNA transferred to cell's nucleus (human DNA)
  - About 1,500 mitochondrial genes embedded within human DNA
  - Each mitochondrion still has 37 genes for self-maintenance and independence
  - 100% committed to eukaryotic cells: neither can survive without each other
- **Size and Quantity**
  - Average human cell contains 3-400 mitochondria
  - Total mitochondria in the body: about 10 million billion
  - Make up about 10% of body weight despite small size
  - Highly concentrated in metabolically demanding cells (brain cells)
- **Function**
  - Produce lion's share of ATP, especially for brain cells
  - Average human adult produces 9 × 10^20 ATP molecules per second
  - Move around the cell using microtubules and filaments (cytoskeleton)
- **Movement and Location**
  - Go to places in the cell where energy is needed
  - Stay in places near factories (ribosomes) or synapses for brain function
- **Mitochondrial Roles**
  - Rapid recyclers of ATP and ADP
  - Provide ATP, recycle ADP simultaneously
  - Interact with other organelles and each other for cell functions
  - Critical role in almost all cell functions, including gene expression.

#### Mitochondria: More Than Just Energy Providers

**Mitochondria's Role in Cell Function**

**Ion Pumping**:
- Cells require energy to set up ion pumps
- Triggered cells set off a cascade of events leading to cell function (e.g., neurotransmitter or hormone release)
- Ion pumping requires significant time and work to set up, but is easy to initiate

**Calcium Regulation**:
- Calcium levels act as an "on/off" switch for cells
- Mitochondria are directly involved in calcium regulation
- Dysfunctional mitochondria disrupt calcium regulation and the cell's "off" switch

**Energy and Mitochondria**:
- Mitochondria provide almost all the energy needed for ion pumping and cell function
- Mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to cells staying on too long or failing to work

**Mitochondria's Other Roles**:
- **Metabolic Regulation**: Mitochondria help regulate metabolism through mitochondrially derived peptides (e.g., humanin, MOTS-c, SHLP1–6)
- **Neurotransmitter Production and Regulation**: Mitochondria play critical roles in neurotransmitter production, secretion, reuptake, and regulation

#### Mitochondria's Central Role in Stress Response and Immune Function

**Mitochondria's Role in Metabolism and Beyond**

**Mitochondria as Regulators of Metabolism and Mitochondria Themselves**:
- Essential regulators of metabolism and mitochondrial function
- Help manage cellular stress and coordinate the integrated stress response

**Mitochondria's Role in Immune System Function**:
- Play essential role in immune system regulation
- Help regulate how immune cells engage with immune receptors
- Release components that serve as danger signals, activating chronic inflammation

**Mitochondria's Role in Stress Responses**:
- Control and coordinate stress response in the body (physical and mental)
- Initiate integrated stress response when cells are physically stressed
- Trigger death or "zombie" state if unable to manage stress

**Mitochondria's Involvement in Hormone Regulation**:
- Key regulators of hormones, as they synthesize, package, and release them
- Mitochondrial enzymes initiate production of certain hormones (e.g., cortisol, estrogen, testosterone)
- Some cells have mitochondrial receptors for these hormones, allowing them to travel between cell types

**Mitochondria and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)**:
- Generate ROS during energy production process
- Small amounts of ROS serve a signaling function within the cell
- Large amounts of ROS are toxic, leading to inflammation, mitochondrial damage, and cellular damage
- Mitochondria also help clean up ROS through an elaborate system of enzymes and factors.

#### Mitochondria's Role in Gene Expression and Cell Function

**Mitochondria and Cellular Function**

**Detoxification Failure**:
- ROS waste products can pile up and cause damage
- Leads to cellular dysfunction, aging, cell death, and disease

**Mitochondrial Shapeshifting**:
- Mitochondria change shape in response to environmental factors
- Can be long/thin or short/fat
- Interact through fusion (merging) and fission (division)
- Importance for cell function: 
  - Mitochondrial fusions impact fat storage, eating behaviors, and obesity
  - Changes in shape send signals affecting the entire body

**Mitochondria and Gene Expression**:
- Nuclear DNA contains the human genome
- Genes control cell function, but epigenetics determines which genes are active
- Mitochondria regulate epigenetics by sending signals to nuclear DNA (retrograde response)
- ATP levels, ROS, and calcium impact gene expression and require mitochondrial function

**Mitochondrial Role in Epigenetics**:
- Mitochondria are required for the transport of epigenetic factors like histone H1
- Mitochondrial ROS inactivate enzymes regulating epigenetic gene expression (histone demethylase)
- Mitohormones, such as GPS2 and MOTS-c, released by mitochondria regulate nuclear DNA

**Mitochondrial Biogenesis**:
- Cells can produce more mitochondria under certain conditions
- More healthy mitochondria lead to healthier cells

**Mitochondria in Cell Growth and Differentiation**:
- Mitochondria are essential for cell growth, differentiation, and energy production

#### The Multifaceted Role of Mitochondria in Cell Function

**Mitochondria's Role in Cell Function**

**Mitochondria's Essential Functions:**
- Regulate calcium levels and other signaling pathways
- Fusion with each other sends signals that activate genes in the nucleus
- Involved in autophagy process, generating signals like ROS and metabolic factors
- Interact with lysosomes during autophagy
- Provide energy (ATP) for cell maintenance and autophagy processes

**Mitochondria and Apoptosis:**
- Release cytochrome c when under high stress, activating "killing enzymes"
- Play a role in both apoptosis and autophagy

**Mitochondria as Workers in the Cell:**
- Provide various functions within cells: neurotransmitter production, hormone release, muscle function, etc.
- Communicate with and regulate other organelles (nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes)
- Interact with mitochondria in other cells through hormones and peptides
- Control the regulation of genes daily and during cell growth/differentiation

**Mitochondria's History:**
- Long overlooked due to focus on larger cell components (nucleus, membrane)
- Recent research has revealed surprising roles and interactions with other organelles
- Evidence suggests mitochondria may be the control center of the cell

### Chapter 8: A Brain Energy Imbalance

**Evidence of Metabolic Problems in Mental Disorders**
* Previous chapter reviewed mitochondria's role and effects on cells, metabolism, neurotransmitters, hormones, inflammation, immune system function, gene expression, development, and cell health
* Link between mental disorders and metabolic disorders, such as diabetes, dating back to the 1950s
* Evidence of metabolic abnormalities in markers: ATP levels, redox balance, hormones, neurotransmitters, lactate (a marker of metabolic stress)
* Infusing lactate can precipitate panic attacks in people with panic disorder
* Cortisol dysregulation plays a role in some people with mental disorders
* Neuroimaging studies show metabolic differences in the brains of people with mental disorders
* Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), near-infrared spectroscopic imaging (NIRSI), positron emission tomography (PET), blood-oxygen-level-dependent imaging (BOLD), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) all measure metabolism in the brain
* Heterogeneity and inconsistent findings despite metabolic differences being known for decades

**Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Mental Health**
* Mitochondria play a large role in human health, and when they don't function properly, the body doesn't either
* Impairment in mitochondrial function is called mitochondrial dysfunction
* Widespread disorders associated with mitochondrial dysfunction include psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia to borderline personality disorder), metabolic disorders (obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), neurological disorders (Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease), and many cancers.

#### Mitochondrial Dysfunction: The Common Root Cause of Mental Disorders

**Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Mental Disorders**

**Background:**
- Wide range of diagnoses linked to mitochondrial dysfunction
- Evidence exists for decades, but not widely recognized in psychiatry
- Importance of mitochondria in human health and disease has been studied extensively

**Historical Research:**
1. **Raymond Pearl**: Published "The Rate of Living Theory" (1928), focusing on metabolic rate and aging
2. **Denham Harman**: Proposed free radical theory of aging (1954) and mitochondrial theory of aging (1972)
3. Increasing research on mitochondria in obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, aging, and mental disorders since 1970s

**Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Psychiatric Disorders:**
- Dr. Douglas Wallace: Claimed all psychiatric disorders result from mitochondrial dysfunction (2017)
- Mitochondrial genetics play a role due to high mutation rate and lack of protection for mitochondrial DNA
- Brain is particularly affected as it's highly dependent on energy production by mitochondria
- Different parts of the brain may fail first depending on energy deprivation levels

**Rebuttal:**
1. Psychiatric disorders are complex, requiring more than one factor for explanation
2. Mitochondrial dysfunction cannot account for all symptoms in mental disorders or rare genetic mitochondrial diseases
3. Different symptoms even among people with the same mitochondrial genetic mutation
4. Mitochondria have multiple roles beyond energy production, affecting brain function and health
5. Defining "dysfunction" is challenging due to various causes and outcomes

**Measurement of Mitochondrial Function:**
- Difficult to measure in scientific research context
- Can cause different problems for the mitochondria and cells they reside in, affecting overall brain function and health.

#### The Role of Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Mental Disorders

**Mitochondrial Dysfunction**

**Causes of Mitochondrial Dysfunction**:
- Problems with mitochondria themselves:
  - Genetic mutations
  - Shortage of mitochondria in the cell
- Mitrochondrial DNA is prone to mutations due to lack of protection
- Exposure to high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage mitochondrial DNA and other parts, leading to defective mitochondria
- Inability for defective mitochondria to be disposed of and recycled, resulting in a "workforce shortage" for the cell

**Aging and Mitochondrial Dysfunction**:
- Number of mitochondria in cells decreases as we get older, reducing metabolic capacity
- This can lead to productivity decrease, cell death, and organ shrinkage

**Mitochondrial Dysregulation**:
- Factors that affect mitochondrial function come from outside the cell
- Includes neurotransmitters, hormones, peptides, inflammatory signals, and substances like alcohol
- Can cause impairment even when mitochondria were functioning fine before

**Research Approaches**:
- Measuring ATP production: can indicate impaired mitochondrial function
  - Reduced ATP levels affect gene expression and cell function
  - Found in various metabolic, neurological, and mental disorders
- Focusing on oxidative stress: buildup of ROS can damage cells, especially mitochondria
  - Elevated in many metabolic, neurological, and mental disorders

**Limitations of Mitochondrial Research**:
- Failure to consider all diverse mitochondrial functions
- Differences between cell types in mitochondrial health and distribution
- Unclear causality: is illness causing mitochondrial dysfunction or vice versa?

#### Mitochondrial Dysfunction's Impact on Brain Maintenance

**Mitochondrial Dysfunction: Causes and Consequences**

**Causes of Mitochondrial Dysfunction:**
- Not fully understood
- Feedback loops can lead to causes and consequences

**Examples:**
1. Alzheimer's disease: Beta-amyloid accumulation can cause mitochondrial dysfunction (positive feedback loop)
2. Research focuses on understanding the cause of beta-amyloid accumulation, overlooking potential role in mitochondrial dysfunction initiation

**Consequences of Mitochondrial Dysfunction:**
1. Decreased cell maintenance: Impact on development, function, and maintenance of cells
2. Overactive brain functions
3. Underactive brain functions
4. Developmental problems
5. Cell shrinkage and cell death

**Decreased Cell Maintenance:**
- One-third of brain's ATP production used for cell maintenance (housekeeping functions)
- Mitochondria interact with other organelles, such as lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), to facilitate routine maintenance functions
- Interactions between mitochondria and these organelles prevent waste accumulation and protein folding issues

**Examples:**
1. Defects in myelin production or maintenance due to mitochondrial dysfunction
2. Positive feedback cycle: Structural defects can make it harder for cells to work, leading to further metabolic issues
3. Myelin is an outer protective coating for neurons that affects neuron function and signal transmission
4. Mitochondrial dysfunction associated with myelin problems in various mental disorders (schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, etc.)

#### Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Its Impact on Brain Function

**Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Its Impact on Brain Functions**

**Effects of Debris in Mitochondria:**
- Impedes mitochondria movement, obstructing cell function
- Alzheimer's disease associated with protein accumulation (tau) that limits mitochondria's ability to move around the cell
- Interferes with cytoskeleton used for mitochondrial movement
- Results in trouble for the cell and potential cell death

**Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Overactive Brain Functions:**
1. Ion pumping and calcium regulation impact:
   - Proper functioning is crucial to turn cells off
   - Mitochondrial dysfunction prolongs these processes, leading to hyperexcitability
2. Dysfunction in cells meant to slow down other cells (e.g., GABA cells):
   - Malfunctioning GABA cells result in uninhibited cells becoming hyperexcitable
3. Maintenance problems causing hyperexcitability:
   - Lack of myelin allows ions to leak into a cell and cause it to fire
   - Demonstrated through deletion of sirtuin 3 protein essential for mitochondrial health, resulting in seizures and early deaths
4. Mitochondrial abnormalities found in neurons from people with bipolar disorder:
   - Lithium treatment reduces hyperexcitability
5. Hyperexcitability's presence in various mental and neurological disorders

**Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Underactive Brain Functions:**
- Reduced cell function due to insufficient ATP production from mitochondria
- Impacts neurotransmitter release, hormone production, and brain cell function
- Dysregulated hormone levels if mitochondria are dysfunctional or dysregulated.

**Mitochondrial Role in Brain Development:**
- Critical for cell growth, differentiation, synapse formation during development from the womb to early adulthood
- Developmental windows exist for proper brain hardwiring
- Mitochondria's dysfunction or dysregulation can result in permanently absent brain functions.

#### Mitochondria Dysfunction and Depression Connection

**Brain Energy Theory: Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Depression**

**Symptoms of Cell Shrinkage and Death:**
- Symptoms don't wax and wane due to lack of necessary cells and connections
- Cells shrink due to mitochondrial dysfunction
- Reduced workforce leads to inability to maintain entire cell
- Dead parts absorbed by microglia, causing inflammation
- Brain regions affected differently based on risk factors and timing of onset

**Mitochondria and Cell Function:**
- Mitochondria provide energy for cell function and maintenance
- Dysfunction can result in various symptoms
- Impact on different parts of the cell leads to different symptoms

**Evidence of Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Depression:**
1. Impaired ATP production: lower levels in brain, muscle cells, circulating immune cells, and animal models 
2. Abnormalities in mitochondrial proteins found in postmortem brain tissue of people with chronic depression
3. Elevated levels of oxidative stress
4. Biomarkers related to amino acid and lipid metabolism (mitochondrial function) identified through meta-analysis of forty-six studies
5. Lower levels of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC), a mitochondria-produced molecule important for energy production, in depressed individuals
6. Improvement in ALC levels with effective antidepressant treatments and correlation to remission
7. New strategies targeting mitochondia proposed to improve depression treatment.

**Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Depression: Rats Study:**
- Identification of rats exhibiting high anxiety and depression-like behaviors
- Researchers studied the nucleus accumbens, a specific brain region, for differences in mitochondrial function or development.

#### Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Depression and Bipolar Disorder

**Anxious/Depressed Rats:**
- Had fewer mitochondria per cell
- Differences in how mitochondria used oxygen to produce ATP
- Interaction between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was different
- Neurons appeared abnormal due to mitochondrial dysfunction

**Mitochondrial Dysfunction:**
- Can lead to reduced metabolism, underactive functions, and depression symptoms like fatigue, anxiety, and depression
- Mitochondria's ability to fuse with each other and ER is impaired due to lower levels of mitofusin-2 (MFN2) protein
- Increasing MFN2 levels can restore normal mitochondrial function and improve behavior in rats

**Depression vs. Mania:**
- Depressive states are energy-deficient, while manic states involve increased energy production in the brain
- Manic states associated with increased glucose and lactate utilization, elevated neurotransmitters like glutamate and dopamine
- Mitochondrial dysregulation in bipolar disorder, leading to either too little or excessive energy production

**Bipolar Disorder:**
- Mitophagy disruption or mitochondrial biogenesis may occur throughout the body during disease states
- Higher calcium levels and neuronal excitability changes during manic episodes
- Manic episodes cause problems for hyperexcitable cells with poor maintenance and structure, leading to dangerous symptomatic responses.

#### Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Delirium: A Unifying Example for Understanding Psychiatric Symptoms

**Impact of Mitochondrial Dysfunction on Brain Function and PTSD:**
* Two areas affected: amygdala & medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
* **Amygdala**: hyperexcitable in PTSD, sets off fear response
* **mPFC**: inhibits amygdala, underactive in PTSD, impaired panic reaction control
* Evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in PTSD: abnormal gene expression, reduced mitochondria, increased oxidative stress, decreased ATP levels

**Delirium and Mitochondrial Dysfunction:**
* Serious mental disturbance with various psychiatric symptoms
* Can be caused by medical conditions (infections, heart attacks, cancer) or medication/substance withdrawal
* Onset of delirium may include normal responses to severe situations
* Progression: anxiety -> panic attacks -> confusion -> disorientation -> hallucinations
* Delirium diagnosis: lumping all symptoms under the diagnosis, regardless of mental disorder
* Gradual onset (UTI): can be difficult to recognize and diagnose, but treatment resolves symptoms.

**Impact of Medical Conditions on Mitochondrial Function:**
* Delirium: any psychiatric symptom can occur due to impaired mitochondrial function caused by various medical conditions or medication withdrawal.

**Misconceptions about Delirium:**
* Healthcare professionals attribute all symptoms under delirium diagnosis, even if they don't present with every mental disorder's full set of symptoms.

**Recognition and Diagnosis of Delirium:**
* Early stages: anxiety may be mistaken for normal reaction or given psychiatric medication without a formal delirium diagnosis
* Late stages: confusion, disorientation, hallucinations lead to delirium diagnosis.

**Gradual Onset of Delirium (UTI):**
* Symptoms look identical to Alzheimer's disease or other mental disorders but are due to a UTI and resolved by treating the infection.

#### Delirium and Mitochondrial Dysfunction: A Deadly Connection

**Neurotransmitters, Stress Responses, Inflammation, and Delirium**
* Experts examine various factors contributing to psychiatric symptoms (neurotransmitters, stress responses, inflammation)
* Brain energy theory offers a potential explanation for the connection between these factors and mental symptoms

**Delirium: Causes and Treatment**
* Proposed to be due to disturbed brain energy metabolism or "cerebral metabolic insufficiency" (Engel, 1959)
* PET imaging studies reveal decreased glucose metabolism in people with delirium (Engel, 2000)
* Treatment depends on underlying cause and specific symptoms; standard treatments for medical conditions are implemented
* Sedating medications may be used to control mental symptoms until the medical condition is resolved

**Importance of Addressing Delirium Symptoms**
* Mental symptoms can indicate more widespread or severe mitochondrial dysfunction
* Increased risk of mental disorders, dementia, cognitive impairment, and seizures (Engel, 2001; Kovak et al., 2003)
* Higher mortality rates for people with delirium during hospital admission and after discharge (Cournoyer et al., 2016; Dosemeci & Karademir, 2018)

**Mental Symptoms as an Indicator of Mitochondrial Dysfunction**
* Mental symptoms may signal metabolic and mitochondrial failure (Engel, 2001; Kovak et al., 2003; Roberts et al., 2009)
* Depression linked to higher rates of premature death and seizures in elderly patients with medical illnesses (Sandman et al., 2000; van den Akker et al., 2015)

#### Mental Disorders as Metabolic Brain Dysfunctions: An Overview

**Mental Disorders and Mitochondrial Dysfunction**

**Evidence for Mitrochondrial Role in Mental Disorders**:
- People with mental disorders are more likely to develop "organic" mental disorders like delirium and dementia
- Chronic mental illnesses indicate metabolic or mitochondrial dysfunction
- Delirium is a common occurrence during the dying process, often preceding seizures, coma, and death

**Implications for Diagnostic Labels**:
- Current diagnostic labels provide useful information on symptom constellations
- However, they do not account for the underlying metabolic dysfunction
- A "metabolic brain dysfunction" diagnosis with symptom specifiers could be more informative

**Brain Energy Theory Recap**:
- Mental disorders are metabolic disorders of the brain
- Mitochondria regulate metabolism and can cause overactive, underactive, or absent brain functions
- Various mechanisms through which mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to mental illness symptoms

## Part III: Causes and Solutions
### Chapter 9: What’s Causing the Problem and What Can We Do?

**Contributing Causes of Mental Illness: Metabolism and Mitochondria**

**Metabolism and Mitochondria:**
- Common pathway in mental disorders
- Brain energy theory links risk factors
- Traffic analogy: metabolism = flow of traffic, mitochondria = drivers and workers
- Mitochondria involved in metabolism but not always the cause of problems

**Contributing Causes:**
1. Biological Factors:
   - Genetic predisposition
   - Epigenetics
   - Inflammation
   - Hormonal imbalances

4. Variability in symptoms is due to the combination of contributing causes and their impact on different individuals.

#### Understanding Mental Health: Linking Metabolism and Brain Function

**Metabolism and Mental Illness:**

**Two Primary Answers to Differences in Vulnerabilities**
1. **Preexisting vulnerabilities**:
   - All people are unique, even identical twins
   - Genetic code doesn't guarantee uniformity
   - Biological blueprint (genetics) + past experiences and environmental exposures influence metabolism and mitochondria health
   - Weakest link determines overall metabolic strength
   - Muscles analogy: different symptoms due to varying vulnerabilities
2. **Differences in inputs:**
   - Cells respond differently to various inputs
   - Different brain regions need different amounts of energy
   - Contributing causes impact specific cells, leading to diverse symptoms

**Relationship between Mental and Metabolic Disorders**
- Understanding individual vulnerabilities helps explain the connection
- Metabolism is interconnected: traffic analogy
  * Traffic jam spreads if not addressed (symptoms)
  * Long-term problems can cause metabolic deterioration over time

**Treatments and Success Stories**
- Strategies to address contributing causes: remove/reduce dysregulators, correct imbalances, improve metabolism
  1. Treatments for dysregulating factors: diet, sleep, stressors, etc.
  2. Correcting metabolic imbalances: neurotransmitter or hormonal adjustments
  3. Metabolism enhancement techniques: mitochondrial biogenesis, mitophagy, autophagy
- Chapter Twenty will provide an overall approach and strategies for treatment plans
- Implement treatments after understanding all contributing causes and approaches fully
- Real people's success stories using metabolic interventions will be shared throughout the book.

### Chapter 10: Contributing Cause: Genetics and Epigenetics

**Genetics and Epigenetics**

**Mental Disorders and Families**:
- Mental disorders have been observed to run in families
- Conclusion: Genetic information is transmitted from parents to children, implying a genetic cause

**The Human Genome Project (HGP)**:
- 1990-2003: Researchers began sequencing and mapping all human genes
- Initial hope that the HGP would lead to cures for inherited illnesses, including mental disorders

**Genetics of Mental Illness**:
- **Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)**: Scanned the entire genome for genes related to mental illness
- Found no meaningful relationships between genes and mental illness
- Most risk genes are not specific to individual disorders, but confer risk for many psychiatric, metabolic, and neurological disorders

**Genes Related to Mitochondria and Metabolism**:
- **DISC1 gene**: Confers risk for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and autism; related to mitochondrial function and neuron development
- **CACNA1C gene**: Plays a major role in oxidative stress and mitochondrial integrity and function
- **APOE gene**: Increases risk for Alzheimer's disease; codes for a protein related to fat and cholesterol transportation and metabolism

**Mitochondria and Mental Illness**:
- Many risk genes are directly related to mitochondria and metabolism
- The APOE gene strongly impacts both metabolism and mitochondria

#### Epigenetics and Mitochondria: The Role in Brain Function and Mental Disorders

**APOE4 and Alzheimer's Disease:**
* APOE4 increases risk for some metabolic and mental disorders
* Increases risk for cardiovascular disease, certain mental disorders, epilepsy
* Decreases risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes due to complexity of metabolism
* Affects brain cells (astrocytes and microglia) in specific ways
* Gradual decline in function leads to cognitive symptoms
* Other mental symptoms appear once complete failure occurs
* Metabolism and mitochondria play a role as common pathway
* Mitochondrial genetics are complicated, influenced by both nuclear and mitochondrial genes
* Genes within mitochondria more susceptible to mutations
* Mitochondrial genes impact brain function, behavior, cognition, food intake, stress response
* Research on mitochondrial genes under-explored due to assumptions they don't matter significantly

**Epigenetics:**
* Field studying what causes genes to turn on or off
* Most people have similar genes but expression varies
* Epigenetics responsible for making cells different from each other
* Genes get turned on and off based on environmental circumstances and body needs
* Long-lasting epigenetic changes provide memory of the body's experiences
* Traits, both physical and mental, linked to specific patterns of gene expression
* Methylation, histones, micro-RNAs, hormones, neuropeptides influence gene expression
* Factors that impact epigenetics revolve around metabolism and mitochondria.

#### Epigenetics, Mitochondria, and Intergenerational Trauma: A Look at the Connection

**Epigenetics as Metabolic Blueprints**
- Epigenetics reflect gene patterns for cell survival and coping with environment
- Maladaptive patterns or lack of appropriate signals can become problematic

**Mitochondria's Role in Epigenetics**
- Regulators of epigenetics
- Influence gene expression through ROS, glucose/amino acids, ATP levels
- Control essentially all genes for a cell

**Transmission of Metabolic and Mental Disorders through Epigenetics**

**Womb Environment**:
- Fetus is bathed in metabolic signals from mother
- Mother's hormones, neuropeptides, alcohol, drugs, prescription meds affect fetus
- Dutch winter famine study: babies born during famine more likely to develop metabolic and mental disorders later in life

**Early Life**:
- Caregiver neglect/deprivation profound effects on children's metabolic and mental health
- Epigenetic mechanisms play a role
- NAD cofactor transfer from mother to baby via breast milk impacts mitochondria, metabolism, and epigenetics in offspring

**Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma**:
- Parental trauma linked to poor mental health outcomes in children and grandchildren
- Not just psychological or social cause; physiological mechanisms involved (e.g., cortisol sensitivity)

#### Epigenetic Factors in Transgenerational Mental Health Issues

**Genetics and Epigenetics:**
- **Revolution** in understanding that mental disorders may not be solely due to specific "abnormal" genes
- **Transmission of mental illness**: more likely through epigenetic mechanisms, which are reversible
- **Epigenetics playing a significant role** in transmission from parents to children and even grandchildren

**Discoveries:**
- Differences in methylation patterns of glucocorticoid receptor and other DNA regions associated with stress response system
- Fathers passing on traumatic experiences through epigenetic mechanisms, such as miRNA molecules in sperm
- Studies show sperm in both mice and men transmit offspring miRNAs affected by early childhood stress
- Low levels of specific miRNAs (449 and 34) found in men with highest levels of stressful life events
- Timing of stress can influence brain function differently: fetal exposure to maternal stress, childhood separation, severe abuse

**Implications:**
- Fetal exposure to mother's stress results in higher rates of learning impairment, depression, anxiety
- Early childhood separation leads to higher cortisol levels throughout life; severe abuse can result in lower cortisol levels
- Epigenetic mechanisms likely responsible for mental illness transmission rather than "abnormal" genes

**Hopeful Aspects:**
- Most epigenetic mechanisms are reversible through lifestyle interventions alone
- People are not usually born with permanent, fixed genetic defects that make it impossible to be healthy
- Mental illnesses not caused by genetic defects but rather environmental factors or dysfunctional mitochondria

**Mitochondria Dysfunction:**
- Primary causes of mental illness often in our environments or mitochondrial function
- Even those with APOE4 gene allele, which impairs mitochondrial function over time, have hope for healing through treatments that improve autophagy.

### Chapter 11: Contributing Cause: Chemical Imbalances, Neurotransmitters, and Medications

**Chemical Imbalances, Neurotransmitters, and Medications**

**Chemical Imbalance Theory**:
- Does not challenge observations of neurotransmitter imbalances playing a role in mental disorders
- Does not challenge clinical trials demonstrating improvement in symptoms using medications that affect neurotransmitters
- Does not challenge the real-world experience of people helped or saved by psychiatric medications

**Limitations of Chemical Imbalance Theory**:
- Leaves many questions unanswered
- Fails to restore lives for far too many people
- **Brain energy theory** offers new ways to understand neurotransmitter imbalances and the effects of medications

**Mitochondria and Metabolism**:
- Explain the underactivity and overactivity/hyperexcitability of specific brain cells that result in neurotransmitter imbalances
- Neurotransmitters produce their own effects in target cells, resulting in a "chain of dominoes" of metabolic disruption

**Neurotransmitters and Mitochondria**:
- **Mitochondria** play a key role in the production of many neurotransmitters
- **Mitochondria** have receptors for important neurotransmitters on their membranes (e.g., benzodiazepine, GABA receptors)
- **Mitochondria** have an enzyme involved in the degradation and regulation of some key neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine)

**Serotonin**:
- Not just a "simple on/off signal" between cells
- **Neurotransmitter** with a prominent and complex role in metabolism and mitochondrial function
- Serotonin increases mitochondrial function and biogenesis, which can improve metabolic function
- Serotonin is a product of the kynurenine pathway, which involves the fate of the amino acid tryptophan and the production of NAD, a molecule important for energy production and electron management

**GABA**:
- **Neurotransmitter** with a wide range of functions
- **Mitochondria** directly influence and sometimes control GABA activity
- **GABA** can sequester inside mitochondria, directly controlling its release
- **GABA** plays a role in metabolic disorders like obesity

#### Mitochondria and Psychiatric Medications: Impact on Neurotransmitters and Metabolism

**Dopamine and Mitochondria**
- Dopamine is released from neurons, binds to receptors, and can be taken up into the releasing neuron for another round
- Some dopamine ends up inside cells, which is managed by mitochondria through monoamine oxidase enzyme
- This process directly stimulates mitochondria to produce more ATP

**Dopamine's Role in Regulation of Glucose and Metabolism**
- Dopamine D2 receptors are found not only in the brain but also in the pancreas, playing a critical role in insulin release and glucagon regulation
- Antipsychotic medications can affect weight, diabetes, and metabolism due to their impact on dopamine D2 receptors

**Neurotransmitters, Mitochondria, and Metabolism Connections**
- Serotonin, GABA, or dopamine levels are affected by psychiatric medications, which have impacts on mitochondria and metabolism
- Medications like Valium activate the ventral tegmental area (VTA), increasing dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and enhancing mitochondrial function, resulting in reduced anxiety and enhanced social dominance

**Mitochondrial Effects of Psychiatric Medications**
- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors increase epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels near mitochondria, stimulating mitochondrial activity
- Lithium enhances ATP production, antioxidant capacities, and calcium signaling within cells, all related to mitochondria
- Antipsychotic medications like lithium can impair mitochondrial function, leading to neurological side effects such as tremors, muscle rigidity, and tardive dyskinesia (TD)
- Mitochondrial dysfunction is the most likely explanation for these neurological side effects.

### Chapter 13: Contributing Cause: Inflammation

**Inflammation's Role in Metabolism, Mental Health, and Mitochondrial Function**

**Observations about Inflammation**:
- Many people consider inflammation as a bad thing
- Low-grade inflammation is often found in metabolic and mental disorders
- Neuroinflammation may be the root cause of some mental and neurological disorders
- Cytokine storms can kill people with COVID-19
- Lingering inflammation causes long COVID symptoms

- It serves important signaling functions
- Involved in the normal stress response
- Inflammatory cytokines send stress signals throughout the body and brain
- Microglial cells, the brain's immune cells, play a role in brain development, learning, and memory

**Inflammation and Metabolism**:
- Inflammation affects metabolism by allocating and using metabolic resources
- When inflammatory cytokines are released, more blood flows to the affected area, bringing oxygen, glucose, amino acids, and fats
- Inflammation triggers the production of immune cells and antibodies, which take energy and resources
- High levels of inflammation can change emotions, thoughts, motivations, and behaviors, conserving metabolic resources

**Mental States Causing Inflammation**:
- Loneliness increases the stress response and induces a specific pattern of immune cell activation, leading to chronic, low-grade inflammation
- Lonely people and monkeys were more vulnerable to viral infections
- Mental symptoms can cause inflammation, which can trigger or exacerbate mental and metabolic disorders

**Examples of Inflammation's Impact on Disorders**:
- Rhinitis (runny nose) increases the risk of depression by 86%
- Infections can lead to subsequent mental disorder diagnoses, including schizophrenia, OCD, personality disorders, and more

#### The Role of Chronic Inflammation in Mental and Metabolic Health

**Inflammation's Impact on Mental and Metabolic Health**

**Lifestyle Factors and Inflammation**:
- Many lifestyle factors can cause widespread metabolic dysfunction, leading to chronic inflammation
- Addressing these lifestyle factors is powerful in decreasing inflammation and addressing metabolic and mental disorders
- Antioxidants alone do not counteract the negative effects of these lifestyle factors

**Autoimmune Disorders and Inflammation**:
- Autoimmune disorders are associated with high levels of inflammation, contributing to mental and metabolic disorders
- Addressing these may require anti-inflammatory treatments or addressing hormone deficiencies

**Chronic Infections and Inflammation**:
- Chronic infections (e.g., HIV, chronic Lyme disease, hepatitis) take a metabolic toll and can lead to problems
- Work with healthcare provider for optimal care

**Allergies and Inflammation**:
- Allergens can lead to chronic inflammation
- Sometimes allergens can be avoided; other times, treatments may be needed

- Exacerbation of metabolic disorders (diabetes, obesity, heart disease)
- Contributing cause for onset of various disorders

**Impact of Sleep Deprivation:**
- Depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, mania, psychosis in extreme cases
- Genetic association with clock genes and mental/metabolic disorders
- Increased risk for metabolic disorders: diabetes, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease

**Mitochondria's Role:**
- Synchronized with circadian rhythms
- Energy production decreases at night, increases during the day
- Mitochondrial fission and ATP production controlled by DRP1 protein
- Feedback cycle between mitochondria and circadian clock through DRP1.

**Impact of Sleep Deprivation on Mitochondrial Function:**
- Impairment in mitochondrial function upon sleep deprival

#### The Role of Mitochondria in Sleep and Mental Health

**Mitochondria's Role in Sleep and Mental Health:**

**NAD and Circadian Rhythm**:
- NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a metabolic cofactor controlled by circadian clocks
- Affects mitochondrial activity, resulting in more ATP production
- Disrupted circadian rhythm leads to off-balance NAD production and mitochondrial dysfunction

**Mitochondria's Role in Sleep Regulation**:
- Researchers have found that mitochondria play a direct role in regulating sleep in fruit flies
- Mitochondrial ROS levels linked to neurons that induce sleep

**Impact of Mitochondrial Defects on Sleep Patterns**:
- Fruit flies with mitochondrial defects exhibit disrupted circadian rhythms and sleep patterns
- Humans with mitochondrial defects often experience sleep-disordered breathing problems

**Effect of Light on Mitochondria**:
- Different wavelengths of light (red, blue) impact mitochondrial function differently:
  * Red light stimulates ATP production
  * Blue light inhibits ATP production and increases ROS production

**Mitochondria's Role in Brain Function**:
- Light exposure affects the brain through several mechanisms:
  1. SCN detects light, sending circadian signals to mitochondria
  2. Urocanic acid (UCA) produced from skin cell exposure to light stimulates neurons that make glutamate

### Chapter 15: Contributing Cause: Food, Fasting, and Your Gut

**Contributing Causes: Food, Fasting, and Gut**

**Diet's Effect on Metabolism and Mitochondria:**
- Diet impacts obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, mental health, brain function, appetite, eating behaviors, addiction, loneliness, social isolation, anxiety, depression.
- Neural circuits for appetite and eating behaviors overlap with neural circuits for social isolation and addiction.

**Nutrients and Vitamins:**
- Three vitamins required for energy metabolism within mitochondria: thiamine, folate, vitamin B12.
- Deficiencies in these vitamins can cause widespread symptoms including mental ones (depression, apathy, etc.).
- Importance of checking for deficiencies in patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders.

**Food Quality:**
- Food supply has changed dramatically in last fifty years: genetically modified plants, processed foods, artificial ingredients.
- Controversies over which dietary factors are bad for health (fat, carbohydrates, animal-sourced products).

**Trans Fatty Acids (TFAs):**
- Man-made, processed fats once marketed as healthier alternative to saturated fats.
- Toxic to human health: increased risk of cardiovascular disease, depression, behavioral aggression, irritability, Alzheimer's disease.
- Animal study showed TFAs can affect baby rats' anxiety levels, ROS production, inflammation, and glucocorticoid receptors in hippocampus.

#### Impact of Maternal Diet on Childhood Mental Health and Metabolism

**Maternal Diet and its Impact on Children's Health:**
* Study demonstrates interconnection between mother's diet during pregnancy and children's anxiety, mitochondrial function, inflammation, and glucocorticoid receptor levels (stress response)
* Trans fats banned in the US since 2018; potential link to higher rates of depression and anxiety among American youth?

**Maternal Trauma and Mental Illness:**
* Parents can transmit vulnerability to mental illness from their trauma history
* Research suggests that if a mother ate trans fats during pregnancy, it may affect metabolic health

**Fiber and Mental Health:**
* Fiber is crucial for overall health and aging
* High fiber intake associated with lower rates of depression and cognitive impairment (Mediterranean diet)
* Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid produced by gut microbes from fiber, plays role in mental health:
  * Serves as primary fuel source for mitochondria in gut cells and liver cells
  * Directly impacts mitochondrial function, efficiency, and dynamics (fusion/fission)
  * Plays a role in sleep regulation through the liver or portal vein

**Overeating and Mental Health:**
* Junk food can be addictive, leading to high insulin and glucose levels
* High blood glucose levels might impair mitochondrial function in neurons, affecting mood, cognitive processing, memory, attention, sadness, anxiety, and Alzheimer's disease risk.

**Mitochondria's Role in Glucose Regulation:**
* Mitochondria in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) regulate glucose levels throughout the body by fission and ROS production control. Dysfunctioning mitochondria may cause glucose regulation issues, leading to sadness, anxiety, and increased Alzheimer's disease risk.

#### Metabolism, Mitochondria, and Obesity: Interplay Between Brain and Body

**Obesity, Metabolism, and Mitochondrial Function:**
* **Impact of Obesity on Metabolism**: Thin individuals feel "stuffed" after overeating, leading to decreased food intake or increased metabolism. Obese people have different responses: metabolic rate may not increase, or metabolism can decrease (metabolic adaptation).
* **Mitochondria's Role in Obesity and Mental Health**: Both conditions are linked to mitochondrial dysfunction; impaired mitochondria can worsen both obesity and mental disorders.
* **Insulin Resistance and Mitochondrial Function**: Insulin resistance (IR) affects both body and brain metabolism, leading to increased insulin production and impaired mitochondrial biogenesis. This inhibits the body's response to stress and promotes weight gain.
* **Mitochondria and Brain Cells:** Dysfunctional mitochondria in brain cells can cause inflammation, leading to obesity even before any significant weight gain. UCP2 protein plays a role in this process by affecting mitochondrial dynamics (movement, fusion, and fission).
* **Mitochondria and Food Consumption:** Mitochondria play a crucial role in the brain's response to high-calorie diets, potentially driving obesity or preventing it. More research is needed on how mitochondrial function affects long-term health outcomes when consuming toxic foods.

**Fasting, Starvation, and Eating Disorders:**
* **Fasting**: Going without food for any length of time; changes to metabolism and mitochondria occur during extended fasting periods.
* **Impact on Metabolism**: Fasting leads to increased metabolic rate and weight loss in some cases. Conversely, starvation can result in decreased metabolic activity and weight gain due to the body's attempt to conserve energy.
* **Eating Disorders**: Mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders, further emphasizing the connection between mitochondrial function, metabolism, and mental health.

- May become a way of life for some, despite causing health problems
- Increases risk of developing mental disorders due to seeking relief from discomforts

**Gut-Brain Axis and Microbiome's Role in Health:**
- Intestinal tract plays significant role in metabolic and mental health
- Communication between gut and brain occurs through various mechanisms:
  * Trillions of bacteria, fungi, and viruses influence weight gain or loss by altering nutrient extraction
  * Hormones and neuropeptides produced by cells lining the intestinal tract travel to brain and affect metabolism and brain function
  * Gut has an intricate nervous system that communicates directly with the brain via vagus nerve

**Role of Gut Microbiome in Mental Disorders:**
- Increasing evidence for its role in depression, anxiety, autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative disorders
- Gut bacteria produce metabolites, neurotransmitters, and hormones that affect brain function when absorbed into the bloodstream

**Interactions between Mitochondria, Gut Microbes, and Signals:**
- Gut microbes send signals directly to mitochondria in cells lining the gut and immune cells, changing metabolism and inflammation.

**Dietary Interventions as Treatments for Mental Symptoms:**
1. Addressing nutritional deficiencies or removing dietary allergens/toxins
2. Eating a healthy diet, such as Mediterranean diet
3. Fasting, intermittent fasting (IF), and fasting-mimicking diets to improve metabolic health by stimulating autophagy and mitophagy
4. Improving gut microbiome balance through dietary changes or supplements
5. Changing diet to address metabolism and mitochondrial function issues
6. Losing weight for those who are obese or gaining weight for underweight individuals.

- Brain energy problem due to reduced glucose metabolism in some cases
- Developmental windows can close, leading to potential loss of normal brain development

**Screen Time and ADHD:**
- Children exposed to excessive screen time more likely to develop ADHD
- Two explanations:
  - Environment is driving the diagnosis (children learn constant stimulation as norm)
  - Biology is the problem (inadequate metabolic activity in specific brain regions)
- Correcting metabolic issues may be necessary for solving the problem.

#### Stress, Mitochondria & Purpose: Impact on Health

**Strengthening Brain Regions:**
- Neurons grow, adapt, and form new connections when used
- Metabolism and mitochondria adapt to needs

#### Designing Personalized Mental Health Treatment Plans

**Metabolic Treatment Plans**

**Effects on Metabolism**:
- Interventions can have four types of effects:
  1. **Initiation**: Abruptly shifts metabolism, can be helpful or harmful initially
  2. **Adaptation**: Body adapts to the intervention, lessening its initial effects
  3. **Maintenance**: Metabolism becomes fully adapted to the intervention, stability is achieved
  4. **Withdrawal**: Intervention is reduced or stopped, metabolism rebounding too high or low

**Designing a Comprehensive Treatment Plan**:
- For those with serious mental disorders and impaired brain function:
  - Work with a clinician to develop a comprehensive treatment plan
  - Identify contributing causes leading to severe metabolic impairment or safety threats (e.g., substance use, abuse, eating disorders, lack of sleep)
  - Address these causes first before implementing other treatments
  - Choose one or more treatments and give them at least three months to work
  - If a treatment doesn't help after three months, consider stopping it
  - If a treatment helps but doesn't resolve all symptoms, add another treatment
- Continue adding/trying treatments until desired results are achieved, goals may change over time.

**Inpatient and Residential Treatment Programs**:
- For those with severe mental disorders or safety concerns:
  - Develop inpatient and residential metabolic treatment programs
  - Provide customized treatment plans and support from professionals and peers
  - Environments where participants can improve their mental and metabolic health together.
