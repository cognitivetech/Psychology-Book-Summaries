## 1 PSYCHOLOGY IN YOUR LIFE

**Psychology in Your Life**

* Psychology is important in everyday life as it helps understand mental activity, behavior, and brain processes.
* **Over a million students take introductory psychology every year for various reasons**: career goals, program requirements, or personal interest.
* Psychology provides insight into various aspects of human experience, including perception, learning, relationships, personality, and well-being.

**Why is Psychology Important in Your Life?**

* Psychology is a science that studies mental activity and behavior objectively, focusing on the brain processes underlying these phenomena.
* Understanding psychological principles can help answer questions about various aspects of human experience, such as color perception, study habits, and social behaviors.

**Psychology as a Science**

* Psychology is a scientific discipline that uses empirical methods to investigate mental activity, behavior, and brain processes.
* Empiricism involves systematically investigating and measuring phenomena of interest through research.
* The objective approach of psychology allows for the examination of psychological principles in a generalizable way.

**Three Aspects of Psychology**

1. **Mental Activity and Behavior**:
   * Psychology examines mental processes, such as perception, attention, memory, and thinking, as well as behavior.
   * **An example**: Going to a fast-food restaurant and making a healthier food choice based on calorie information.
2. **Brain Processes**:
   * The brain is responsible for all mental activity and behavior.
   * Brain imaging technologies have provided insight into how the brain allows us to think, feel, and respond appropriately.
3. **Subjective vs. Objective Approach**:
   * Psychology takes an objective approach by using empirical methods to investigate psychological processes.
   * This contrasts with a subjective approach that relies on personal experiences or beliefs.

**Learning Goals**

* **Review the three aspects of psychology**: mental activity and behavior, brain processes, and the scientific approach.
* Understand how psychology can help improve study habits and academic performance by providing objective insights into learning processes.

### 1.2 PSYCHOLOGY USES THE SCIENCE OF LEARNING TO HELP YOU STUDY BETTER

The text discusses the importance of using psychological principles to improve studying habits, learning, and academic performance. The following are six effective strategies for learning based on research in psychology and other fields:

1. **Practicing**

- Effective practice involves actively thinking to remember material and answering sample quiz or practice test questions.
- Repeated practice is more effective when spaced within one study session or across multiple sessions over days.
- Practice is related to better academic performance, regardless of personal characteristics.

2. **Improving (Having a Growth Mindset)**

- Believing that intelligence and skills are not fixed but can be improved through effort and good study strategies.
- Persisting even after failure and seeking out challenging educational experiences.
- Benefits students from underprivileged backgrounds and both low- and high-performing students.

3. **Monitoring**

- Setting measurable learning goals, making specific study plans, checking progress, and making adjustments as needed.
- Research suggests that self-monitoring may help reach academic goals.

4. **Attending**

- Focusing on what is important and ignoring distractions to maximize learning.
- Heavy media multitasking can negatively impact attention and memory.

5. **Connecting**

- Creating connections between new information and existing knowledge to help remember new material.
- Relating new ideas to facts and skills already known strengthens memory traces and improves learning.

6. **Thinking Deeply**

- Engaging in elaboration strategies like explaining concepts, giving examples, and writing answers to learning goals.
- Strengens the memory traces and leads to better retention of information.

**Glossary**

* **Science of learning**: Research in psychology and other fields that suggests how to improve study skills, learning, and academic performance.

### 1.3 PSYCHOLOGY DEVELOPS YOUR CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS

**Critical Thinking and Psychology**

* Critical thinking is an essential skill developed through psychology courses
* Helps evaluate information and reach evidence-based conclusions
* Useful in daily life and academic abilities

**Three Steps in Critical Thinking**

_Step 1: Evaluate the Source of the Claim_

* Keep an open mind but don't accept claims at face value
* Determine who is providing the information
* **Questions to consider for source credibility**:
  * Can you identify the source?
  * What are their qualifications and expertise?
  * Is the source reputable and unbiased?
  * Are there any potential conflicts of interest?
* **Credible sources in psychology**:
  * Experts with advanced degrees in psychology
  * Academic institutions, clinical groups, or research organizations
  * Professionally published scientific journals

_Step 2: Analyze the Information_

* Examine the evidence presented to support the claim
* Consider alternative explanations and perspectives
* Evaluate the quality of the research design and data
* Look for logical inconsistencies or errors

_Step 3: Apply the Information_

* Consider how the information relates to your own experiences and knowledge
* Reflect on the implications of the claim
* Determine what actions, if any, you should take based on the evidence

**Misconceptions vs. Scientific Evidence**

* People often accept beliefs without scientific support
* Misconceptions about psychological phenomena can be harmful (e.g., venting anger in a "rage room")
* Critical thinking helps distinguish fact from fiction and make informed decisions

### LEARNING TIP DEVELOPING CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS

**Critical Thinking Skills Development**

The text discusses the importance of developing critical thinking skills while reading "Evaluating Psychology in the Real World" features in a textbook. The text outlines three steps for evaluating claims: determining the believability of the source, checking for strong empirical evidence, and considering agreement among other reliable sources.

**Step 1: Determining the Believability of the Source (Is the source of the claim believable?)**

* Evaluate the reputation, expertise, and potential conflicts of interest of the source.
* USA Today is identified as the source for a claim about rage rooms and mental health, but its credibility is questioned due to public distrust and the lack of multiple expert opinions presented in the article.

**Step 2: Checking for Strong Empirical Evidence (Is there strong evidence for the claim?)**

* Evaluate the quality and completeness of empirical evidence supporting the claim.
* Intuition, beliefs, and opinions are not considered valid evidence in psychology.
* The article on rage rooms lacks empirical evidence to support the claim that the rooms have positive mental health benefits for people in general.

**Step 3: Considering Agreement Among Other Reliable Sources (Do other believable sources agree about the claim?)**

* Look for additional reliable and credible sources to confirm or disconfirm the claim.
* The lack of agreement among sources, especially the absence of multiple expert opinions in the original article, raises skepticism about the claim that rage rooms are good for mental health.

**Critical Thinking Process**

a. Explore whether there is good empirical evidence to support the claim (Step 2).
b. Determine whether the source of the claim is credible (Step 1).
c. Decision making based on intuition is not part of good critical thinking (not a step in the process).
d. Look for more information to see if other believable sources agree with the claim (Step 3).

### 1.4 PSYCHOLOGY IMPROVES YOUR LIFE PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY

### 1.5 PSYCHOLOGISTS INVESTIGATE TOPICS ACROSS FIVE INTERCONNECTED DOMAINS

**Five Domains of Psychology**

Psychology is a complex field that explores various aspects of mental activity, behavior, and the brain. The five interconnected domains of psychology provide rich insights into psychological processes:

1. **Biological Domain**: This domain focuses on the study of biological factors that influence behavior and mental processes. It includes research on genetics, neuroanatomy, physiology, and pharmacology.
2. **Cognitive Domain**: The cognitive domain investigates mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, language, problem-solving, and decision-making.
3. **Developmental Domain**: This domain examines the psychological and physical changes that occur throughout the human lifespan, from infancy to old age. It includes research on cognitive, social, emotional, and moral development.
4. **Social and Personality Domain**: The social and personality domain explores how individuals think about themselves and others, as well as their interactions with other people. It includes research on personality traits, interpersonal relationships, group dynamics, and social influence.
5. **Mental and Physical Health Domain**: This domain focuses on understanding mental health disorders and promoting positive mental and physical health. It includes research on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of various mental and physical health conditions.

**Why Study Psychology Across Multiple Domains?**

Psychology grew as a field with many independent and competing approaches to studying mental activity and behavior. Today, it is essential to examine psychological processes from multiple perspectives to gain a comprehensive understanding. Each domain provides unique insights into psychological phenomena, and interdisciplinary work can occur in any combination of two or more domains.

**Careers in Psychology**

A degree in psychology opens up various career opportunities. According to the American Psychological Association (APA), there is high demand for people with a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree in psychology. Here are some reasons why:

1. **Growing Demand**: The associate's and bachelor's degrees in psychology are among the fastest-growing degrees in the United States. In 2017-18, there was an increase of 704 percent in the number of psychology associate's degrees awarded compared to 2000-01.
2. **Versatile Careers**: A degree in psychology can prepare you for many different careers, such as personal care aide, human service assistant, psychiatric technician, and more.
3. **Relevant Skills**: The skills developed while studying psychology, such as critical thinking, understanding diversity and ethics, and scientific methodology, are valuable in various jobs.
4. **Advanced Degrees**: Opportunities for people with graduate degrees in psychology to provide counseling services, investigate psychological disorders, or conduct research on other psychological topics are expected to grow much faster than average through 2030.
5. **Interdisciplinary Work**: Psychology's interconnected domains offer opportunities for collaboration and interdisciplinary work with professionals from various fields.

**Example of Multidisciplinary Research in Psychology**

To understand a particular psychological phenomenon, such as sleep or romantic attraction, psychologists explore it across multiple domains. 

For example, to study the nature of romantic attraction, researchers may investigate brain activity during various stages of love (biological domain), how cultural factors influence romantic relationships (social and personality domain), and the role of genetics in romantic attraction (biological domain). 

By considering romantic attraction from multiple perspectives, psychologists gain a richer understanding of this complex phenomenon.

### 1.6 PSYCHOLOGY IS BECOMING MORE DIVERSE

**Description and Increasing Diversity in Psychology**

- Modern psychology's areas of study are becoming more varied due to interconnected domains of research.
- Different types of people with diverse life experiences are now becoming psychologists.
- A wider array of people participate in psychological research for inclusive conclusions.
- Students taking psychology classes come from all walks of life.

**Understanding Diversity**

- Diversity refers to characteristics that make individuals different in specific contexts or situations.
- Includes visible and invisible, inborn and changeable traits.
- Encompasses race, ethnicity, biological sex, national origin, culture, language, religion, sexual orientation, gender, age, political affiliations, socioeconomic status, abilities, values, characteristics, preferences, etc.
- Societies have become increasingly diverse (Ramos et al., 2016).
- Diversity brings benefits such as improved problem solving, creativity, and societal adaptation (Smith & Schonfeld, 2000; Hong & Page, 2004; Jones et al., 2014).

**Historical Context: Early Psychologists and Diversity**

- Early psychologists were predominantly White men.
- **Mary Whiton Calkins** (Figure 1.10a) was the first woman to earn a doctorate in psychology but was denied it because she was a woman.
- **Francis Cecil Sumner** (Figure 1.10b) was the first Black person to earn a doctoral degree in psychology in the US, facing challenges from both White colleagues and Black people.

**Modern Diversity in Psychology**

- **Psychologists are becoming more diverse**: 70% women, 16% underrepresented groups (American Psychological Association, 2020b).
- **Professional organizations support diversity**: Association of Black Psychologists, National LatinX Psychological Foundation, Asian American Psychological Association, American Arab, Middle Eastern, and North African Psychological Association, American Indian and Alaska Native Society of Indian Psychologists.

**Importance of Cultivating Diversity in Psychology**

- Encouraging people from diverse backgrounds to become psychologists.
- Making psychology a career available to all who want to pursue it.
- **For more information, see the [American Psychological Association's Diversity Initiative](https**://www.apa.org/pubs/authors/diversityinitiative)

**Diverse Participants in Psychology Research**:
- Important study revealed 96% of psychology research participants were from Western, industrialized countries despite only 12% of world population living there (Arnett, 2008).
- Only 20% of participants were not students.
- **Cultural Differences in Psychological Processes**:
  - Early stress response research primarily based on male participants led to incorrect assumptions about female responses.
  - Females more likely to respond to stress with a **tend-and-befriend** response, while males exhibit **fight-or-flight** response (Taylor et al., 2000).
  - **Müller-Lyon illusion example**: Americans perceive lines differently due to cultural influences (Segall et al., 1966).
  - Researchers suggest exposure to modern environments may influence visual perception development.
  - Differences in psychological processes between educated participants from Western, industrialized, rich, and democratic countries and participants from other cultures (Henrich et al., 2010).
  - Variability in participants' psychological processes can be predicted based on cultural distance from the dominant culture in the US.
  - Psychologists should conduct research with diverse backgrounds to see the greatest range in psychological processes.

**Diverse Psychology Students**:
- Mary Whiton Calkins and Francis Cecil Sumner paved the way for people from diverse backgrounds to study psychology.
- In 2019, 79% of graduates earning bachelor's degrees in psychology were women.
- **Increasing diversity in terms of race and ethnicity**: 44% of psychology graduates in 2019 identified as people of color.
- Lower relative proportion of people of color earning advanced degrees in psychology.
- More opportunities for individuals from diverse backgrounds to study psychology today.

**Benefits of Diversity**:
1. Expanding knowledge and understanding of psychological processes across various populations.
2. Enhancing problem-solving abilities by considering multiple perspectives.
3. Encouraging cultural sensitivity and empathy, reducing prejudice and discrimination.

### 1.7 PSYCHOLOGISTS MUST BE ETHICAL IN THEIR RESEARCH

**Ethical Principles in Psychological Research**

Psychologists are required to adhere to ethical principles when conducting research to protect participants' physical and emotional well-being. The following are the four ethical standards psychologists must follow:

1. ****Privacy**:

- Researchers must respect participants' privacy.
- Observing people in public is ethical, but observing private behaviors without consent is not.

2. ****Confidentiality**:

- Participants' information must be kept secret and made available only to those who need it.
- Preventing others from linking study findings to actual participants protects their privacy.

3. ****Informed Consent**:

- People must be informed about the research and can choose to participate or not.
- Participants may not always know a study's specific goals beforehand, but they must be informed afterward.
- Deception is sometimes used in research, but participants must be debriefed once the study is completed.

4. ****Protection from Harm**:

- Researchers cannot ask participants to endure unreasonable pain or discomfort.
- The risk/benefit ratio determines whether the potential gains from research justify placing participants at some risk.

**Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)**:

- IRBs review proposed research to ensure it meets ethical standards and protects participants' well-being.
- IRBs consist of administrators, legal advisers, trained scholars, and community members.

**Benefits of Psychological Research**:

Psychology is a science that uses an empirical approach to investigate mental activity, behavior, and brain processes. Participating in psychological research provides the following benefits:

- Contributes to scientific knowledge about how people think, feel, and act.
- Protected by rigorous ethical guidelines.
- Provides valuable information for personal growth and improving daily life.

### 1.8 PSYCHOLOGISTS USE THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD

**Scientific Method in Psychology**

The scientific method is a systematic approach used by psychologists to find objective information related to their scientific goals. The process includes the continuous cycle of five steps:

1. **Formulate a Theory**:
   - A theory is an explanation of how a mental process or behavior occurs, based on interconnected ideas and concepts from prior research.
   - Conduct a literature review using databases like Google Scholar, PsycInfo, or PubMed to explore related scientific articles and refine the theory.
2. **Develop a Testable Hypothesis**:
   - A hypothesis is a specific, testable prediction about what should be observed if the theory is accurate.
   - **Each hypothesis targets one of the four goals of science**: describing, predicting, controlling, or explaining.
3. **Test with a Research Method**:
   - **Choose the most appropriate research method based on the goal and hypothesis**: descriptive (orange boxes), correlational (blue box), or experimental (green box).
   - Manipulate and measure variables to test the cause-effect relationship between study techniques and exam scores.
4. **Analyze the Data**:
   - Summarize raw data and determine if differences exist between groups.
   - Decide whether any differences are meaningful, i.e., significant effects.
5. **Share the Results and Conduct More Research**:
   - Report all research findings to increase confidence in the results and avoid cherry-picking.
   - Continuously test hypotheses through new studies to expand knowledge on the topic.

**Reporting Research Findings**

1. **Scientific Conferences**: Some researchers present their findings at scientific conferences where attendees discuss and share research through talk or poster sessions (Figure 1.19).
2. **Peer-Reviewed Journals**: Publishing articles in peer-reviewed journals is a more thorough means of presenting findings because they include all the background for the research, full methodology, complete data analyses, and discussion of results' implications (Goodman et al., 2016; Vazire, 2018).

**Importance of Replication**

Replication is an essential part of the scientific method. It involves repeating a study to confirm or contradict previous findings (Goodman et al., 2016; Vazire, 2018). The continuous cycle of replication increases confidence in research results:

- Replication attempts provide evidence related to psychological theories.
- Transparency about research methods and data is crucial for future replications.
- Researchers should share materials and data to facilitate replication.
- Determining what issues need further investigation extends the findings' importance and generalizability.

### 1.9 DESCRIPTIVE METHODS DESCRIBE WHAT IS HAPPENING

**1.9 Descriptive Methods**

* Used to describe what is happening in a systematic and objective way
* Suitable for research with goals of describing behavior or beliefs
* **Three main types**: case studies, observational studies, self-reports

**Case Studies**

* Intensive examination of one or a few atypical individuals or organizations
* Yields a lot of data, especially in fields like neuropsychology
* Limited to the specific case studied, cannot be generalized to larger population
* **Example**: N.A., a man who lost the ability to form new permanent memories after a brain injury

**Observational Studies**

* Systematic assessment and coding of observable behavior across specific time intervals
* Coding involves deciding which predefined category an observed behavior fits into
* Can be conducted with or without researcher interaction (observation with intervention)
* Critical in recording what is happening, often a first step in new research
* Difficult to avoid observer bias and reactivity
* **Example**: Research on infants' emotional responses to caretakers after strangers enter the room

**Self-Reports**

* Used when researcher wants information directly from many participants
* Questionnaires, surveys, interviews are common self-report methods
* Participants write answers to questions or respond directly to researchers
* Easy to administer and cost-efficient
* **Example**: Research on sexual behaviors of women and men in the United States by Alfred Kinsey

### THE METHODS OF PSYCHOLOGY

**The Hawthorne Effect**

* Being observed can lead participants to change their behavior.
* **Hawthorne Effect Hypothesis**: Participants may alter their actions due to being part of a study, rather than the independent variable.

**Research on The Hawthorne Effect**

1. ****Background**:

* Conducted at the Hawthorne Works, a Western Electric manufacturing plant in Cicero, Illinois (1924-1933).
* Researchers studied the effects of workplace conditions on workers' productivity.

2. ****Procedure**:

* Changed lighting, pay incentives, and break schedules.
* Measured the speed at which workers did their jobs.

**Results**:

* **Workers' productivity increased when they were being observed, regardless of changes made**: light, pay incentives, or break schedule.

**Conclusion**:

* Being observed can lead participants to change their behavior, possibly due to wanting to make a good impression or be good study participants.

**Research Method Used**

* **Descriptive method,** specifically, an **observational study**.
* Researchers changed various environmental factors and watched workers to see the effects on work speed.

**Self-Report Methods**

* People's answers can involve self-report bias.
* People may not reveal personal information that casts them in a negative light.
* Psychologists design self-reports with confidentiality and care to minimize distortion of truth.

**Descriptive Methods for Sample Research Question**

* What study techniques do students believe are best?
* **Self-report** method**: Creating a questionnaire or interviewing students directly would be helpful in answering this research question.

**Problem with Self-Report Methods**

* People's answers may not reflect the truth due to self-report bias.
* Researchers must consider whether their questions might lead to socially acceptable responses.

### 1.10 CORRELATIONAL METHODS REVEAL RELATIONSHIPS

**Correlational Methods** are research methods used to investigate the relationship between two or more naturally occurring variables without attempting to alter them. The goal is to determine the strength of the connection between the variables. This can be done through observational and self-report methods. If a relationship exists, knowing one variable can help predict what might happen with the other.

**Directionality Problem**: In correlational studies, it is not clear which variable causes the other to change. For example, in the relationship between time spent on Facebook and feelings of depression, it could be that using Facebook causes depression or that depression causes more Facebook use.

**Third Variable Problem**: A third variable (C) may drive the relationship between two variables (A and B). For instance, a tendency to engage in more social comparisons (C) might cause both greater use of Facebook (A) and greater feelings of depression (B).

**Correlation**: A statistical measure that shows the degree of association between two variables. It does not reveal causality.

**Causality**: The relationship between a cause and its effect. Correlational methods cannot establish causality.

**Learning Goal**: Conduct correlational research to determine if there is a relationship between how much time students spend using certain study methods (repeated reading or repeated practicing) and their performance on a later exam.

1. Use self-report data to collect information about the amount of time students spend on their preferred study technique and their exam scores.
2. Analyze the data to determine if there is a correlation between the two variables.
3. **Interpret the results**:
   * No relationship (no correlation)
   * Positive correlation (as one variable increases, so does the other)
   * Negative correlation (as one variable increases, the other decreases)

**Problems with Correlational Methods**:

1. **Directionality Problem**: The direction of the relationship between variables is not known.
2. **Third Variable Problem**: A hidden factor (third variable) may be causing both variables to change.

**Critical Thinking**: When interpreting correlational research, it's essential to consider potential third variables and the directionality problem to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions.

**Impact**: Correlational studies provide valuable information about natural relationships between variables and can lead to important predictions. However, they cannot establish causality. Media reports of correlational studies should be evaluated critically to avoid misinterpretations.

### 1.11 EXPERIMENTAL METHODS TEST CAUSATION 
**Experimental Methods and Causation**

* Experimental methods are used to determine causality between variables and explain phenomena.
* In contrast to correlational methods, experimental methods allow researchers to control the situation and establish causal relationships.

**Components of an Experiment**

**Variables**:

* **Independent variable (IV)**: Manipulated by the researcher and under their control.
	+ Example: Study method used (repeated reading or repeated practice).
* **Dependent variable (DV)**: Outcome measured in the experiment.
	+ Example: Exam performance.

**Operational Definitions of Variables**:

* To ensure objectivity and systematic research, variables must be defined as specifically as possible.
* Operational definitions qualify and quantify variables to make them measurable.

**Designing an Experiment**:

1. **State the hypothesis**: "Using repeated practice to study leads to better exam performance than does repeated reading."
2. Manipulate the independent variable (study method).
3. Measure the effect on the dependent variable (exam performance).

**Operational Definitions of Variables in the Experiment**:

* **Independent variable (IV)**:
	+ Operational definition: Participants use one of two study techniques - repeated reading or repeated practice.
		- Number of times to reread/practice, time between each session, taking notes allowed, and feedback given must be defined.
* **Dependent variable (DV)**:
	+ Operational definition: Performance on an exam after studying.
		- Types of questions on the exam, method of measuring performance, and objective vs. subjective measures must be defined.

**Preregistration**:

* Researchers should preregister their hypotheses and methods, including operational definitions, before starting the research to ensure transparency and replicability.

**Groups in an Experiment**

To determine causality between the independent and dependent variables in an experiment, it's essential to assign some participants to a control group. The control group receives a baseline manipulation that allows comparison with the experimental group. In this example, the control group rereads material twice before taking an exam, while the experimental group takes two practice tests on the material before taking an exam (Figure 1).

**Designs of Experiments**

There are two main types of experimental designs: between-groups and within-subject. In a between-groups design, different people have been in the control and experimental groups. However, in some experiments, participants serve as their own control group in a within-subject design. In this case, the same people receive all treatments but perhaps in different orders (Figure 2).

**Figure 2**:

(a) **Between-Groups Design**: Different people have been in the control and experimental groups.

(b) **Within-Subject Design**: The same people receive all treatments but perhaps in different orders.

**Control and Causality**

Experiments allow researchers to study causality between variables by ensuring that the independent variable is the only thing that varies before the dependent measure is recorded. This eliminates alternative explanations, such as confounds (third variables). Researchers can minimize confounds by controlling for extraneous variables and ensuring identical conditions for both groups (Figure 3).

**Figure 3**:

(a) **Control**: Steps taken by the researcher to minimize the possibility that anything other than the independent variable will affect the experiment's outcome.

(b) **Confound**: Anything that affects a dependent variable and may unintentionally vary between the study's different experimental conditions.

**Generalization of Results**

To ensure that findings apply to as many people as possible, researchers identify a population of interest and take a random sample of participants from that population using random assignment (Figure 4).

**Figure 4**:

(a) **Population**: The group of people that the researcher wants to know about but may or may not be included as participants in the experiment.

(b) **Random Sample**: A subset of individuals selected from a larger population using chance methods.

(c) **Random Assignment**: A method used to assign participants to either the control group or the experimental group based on chance.

**Population and Sampling**

- The population refers to the entire group of people you want your study results to apply to (Figure 1.28a).
- To learn about a population, researchers study a subset or sample of people from that population.
- Sampling is the process of selecting participants for a study.
- Random sampling is the best method to ensure each member of the population has an equal chance of being chosen (Figure 1.28b).
- Convenience samples are used when studying a specific group, but it's important to recognize potential limitations in generalizing findings.

**Random Assignment and Equating Groups**

- People in experiments have individual differences that could affect outcomes (Figure 1.28c).
- Random assignment helps ensure groups are equivalent on average by assigning participants randomly to control or experimental conditions.
- Research has shown that repeated practice leads to better learning and performance than simple rereading (Roediger & Butler, 2011).

## 2 THE ROLE OF BIOLOGY IN PSYCHOLOGY

**Interactive 3D Brain**
- **Explore concepts from the text using an interactive 3D brain model. (<https**://www.brainfacts.org/>)

**Big Questions**
1. How does your nervous system work?
2. How do the parts of your brain function?
3. How does your brain communicate with your body?
4. How do nature and nurture affect your brain?

**Michael Phelps: A Case Study of ADHD**
- Michael Phelps, an Olympic swimmer with ADHD, demonstrates the impact of biology on behavior and psychology.
- ADHD is a disorder that affects how the brain functions.
- Understanding the underlying biology helps us understand typical brain function and the effects of nature and nurture.

**Your Nervous System: The Basis of Your Mental Activity and Behavior**
**Learning Goal**: Explain how neurons support the three functions of the nervous system.

**The Nervous System's Three Functions**
1. Receives sensory input from the world
2. Processes information in the brain
3. Responds to the information by acting on it

**Your Nervous System: Central and Peripheral Divisions**
- The central nervous system (CNS) consists of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.
- The peripheral nervous system (PNS) consists of nerve cells outside of the CNS.
- The two divisions work together to allow you to think, feel, and act.

**Neurons: The Basic Units of Your Nervous System**
- Neurons are the basic units of the human nervous system.
- They receive, integrate, and transmit information in the nervous system.
- Neurons communicate selectively with other neurons to form networks.

**Structure of Neurons**
1. **Dendrites**: short, branchlike extensions that receive signals from neighboring neurons.
2. **Cell body**: collects and integrates incoming information.
3. **Axon**: transmits electrical impulses along its length.
4. **Terminal buttons**: release neurotransmitters into the synapse to communicate with other neurons.

**Neural Communication**
- Neurons communicate through chemical signals called neurotransmitters at the synapse.
- The neurons do not touch each other in the synapse but release chemicals that cross the gap between them.
- This selective communication forms neural networks, allowing complex mental activity and behavior.

### 2.2 NEURONS COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER IN YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM

* Neurons communicate with each other to enable information processing, reception, and response in the nervous system.
* Disruption of neural communication leads to conditions like Multiple Sclerosis (MS), causing sensory and motor impairment.

**Three Phases of Neural Communication**

1. **Transmission Phase**:
   * Electrical signals travel along axons, releasing neurotransmitters into the synapse.
   * Myelin sheath insulates axons for faster neural communication.
2. **Reception Phase**:
   * Dendrites of receiving neurons receive signals from sending neurons.
   * Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron.
3. **Integration Phase**:
   * Postsynaptic neuron assesses and integrates incoming signals.
   * Excitatory or inhibitory signals produced, influencing the likelihood of firing an action potential.

**Electrical Properties of Neurons**

* Neurons have a semipermeable membrane that regulates electrical activity.
* Inside and outside of neurons have different electrical charges.
* Stimulation causes sodium ions to enter, creating an action potential.
* Action potential travels down the axon, releasing neurotransmitters into the synapse.
* Sodium-potassium pump returns neuron to resting state after refractory period.

**Action Potentials and Neurotransmission**

* Action potentials allow one neuron to send a message to another neuron.
* Firing frequency depends on stimulation intensity but not strength of action potential.
* Neurons communicate across the synapse through neurotransmitters.

**Neurotransmitter Release and Reuptake**

* Neurotransmitters are released into the synapse upon arrival of an action potential.
* They bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, stimulating a response.
* Neurotransmitters can be removed from the synapse through reuptake or enzyme degradation.

**Excitatory and Inhibitory Signals**

* Postsynaptic neuron processes incoming signals in integration phase.
* Excitatory signals increase likelihood of firing an action potential, while inhibitory signals decrease it.
* Thousands of signals are added together to determine whether the neuron fires or not.

### 2.3 NEUROTRANSMITTERS INFLUENCE YOUR MENTAL ACTIVITY AND BEHAVIOR

* **Learning Goal**: Contrast agonists and antagonists in terms of their effects on neurotransmitters.
* Caffeine's energizing effects come from neurotransmitters' influence on brain activity.
* Neurotransmitters play crucial roles in thinking, feeling, and behaving (Table 2.1).

**Table 2.1 Common Neurotransmitters and Their Major Functions**

| Neurotransmitter | Functions    |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Acetylcholine     | Motor control, attention, memory, learning, sleeping |
| Norepinephrine    | Arousal and alertness                        |
| Serotonin         | Emotional states, impulse control, dreaming  |

| Endorphins        | Pain reduction, reward                       |

**Drugs Alter How Neurotransmitters Function**

* **Agonists**: drugs that enhance neurotransmitter actions (e.g., nicotine)
* **Antagonists**: drugs that inhibit neurotransmitter actions (e.g., naloxone)
* Receptors cannot distinguish between neurotransmitters and drugs
* Addictive drugs, like heroin and cocaine, act as agonists or antagonists

**Serotonin**:
- Involved in a wide range of psychological activities
- Important for emotional states, impulse control, and dreaming
- Linked to sad and anxious moods, food cravings, and aggressive behavior
- Targeted by drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to treat depression

**Dopamine**:
- Involved in motivation and reward
- Activated during drives such as hunger, thirst, and sex
- Plays a role in drug addiction
- Depleted in Parkinson's disease, leading to impairments in motor abilities

**GABA (Gamma-aminobutyric acid) and Glutamate**:
- *GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter*
- Widely distributed throughout the brain
- Low levels may cause epileptic seizures
- Drugs that are GABA agonists used to treat anxiety disorders
- Alcohol also affects GABA receptors, causing relaxation and interference with motor coordination
- *Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter*
- Involved in fast-acting neural transmission throughout the brain
- Excessive release can lead to overexcitement and destruction of neurons

**Endorphins**:
- Naturally occurring substances that bind to opioid receptors in the brain
- Involved in natural pain reduction
- Released when you do something rewarding, along with dopamine

**Classification of Neurotransmitters**:
1. **Muscle contraction**: Acetylcholine
2. **Sad and lonely**: Serotonin
3. **Pain relief**: Endorphins
4. **Anxiety treatment**: GABA (agonist)
5. **Alertness**: Norepinephrine
6. **Memory recall**: Acetylcholine

**Brain Function**:
- **Nervous system has two main divisions**: 
  - Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) 
  - Central Nervous System (CNS)
- CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord
- Brain is responsible for all higher functions, including seeing, hearing, remembering, interacting with others, and experiencing psychological disorders

**Major regions of the brain**: Hindbrain, Midbrain, Forebrain (Subcortical Structures), and Forebrain (Cortical Structures)

**Hindbrain**:
- **Medulla**: Breathing, heart rate, other survival mechanisms

### 2.4 OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE BRAIN WORKS HAS IMPROVED OVER TIME

**Historical and Contemporary Methods Used to Study Brain Functions**

The understanding of how the brain works has significantly improved over time. The human brain, which weighs approximately 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms), is a complex collection of neurons that interact in massive circuits. These neural circuits have evolved throughout human history to help us adapt to various environments and perform specialized functions.

**Early Studies of the Brain**

By the beginning of the nineteenth century, early psychologists and anatomists had a basic understanding of the brain's structure but debated how different parts produced specific mental processes. 

The theory of phrenology, proposed by Franz Gall and Johann Spurzheim in the early nineteenth century, suggested that different areas of the brain perform distinct functions based on bumps on the skull (Figure 2.11a). Although this theory was eventually debunked, it introduced the idea that certain areas of the brain are related to specific thoughts, behaviors, and functions.

**The first strong evidence for brain regions performing specialized functions** came from **_Paul Broca_**'s study of a patient who lost the ability to produce speech but could understand language (Figure 2.12a). Broca identified a damaged area in the left frontal lobe, now known as Broca's area (Figure 2.12b).

**Modern Brain Research**

Over the last century, scientists have developed various methods to study the brain in action:

1. **Electroencephalograph (EEG)**: 
   - EEG measures the brain's electrical activity by recording the electrical potentials produced by neurons firing in the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp
2. **Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)**: 
   - fMRI measures changes in the blood's oxygen level to indirectly assess brain activity and blood flow (Figure 2.13b). This technique allows researchers to map the working brain by comparing brain images during different tasks.
3. **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)**: 
   - TMS uses a powerful magnetic field to momentarily disrupt brain activity in a specific region, allowing researchers to determine which areas are necessary for specific psychological functions (Figure 2.13c).

### 2.5 THE HINDBRAIN AND MIDBRAIN HOUSE BASIC PROGRAMS FOR YOUR SURVIVAL

* The hindbrain and midbrain are crucial parts of the brain responsible for basic survival processes
* These regions help maintain essential functions for living and reproduction

**Hindbrain**

* Located at the base of the skull, where the spinal cord thickens and becomes more complex
* Contains structures that control body functions essential for survival
* **Divided into three main structures**: medulla, pons, and cerebellum

**Medulla**

* Controls the most basic functions of survival, including heart rate, breathing, swallowing, vomiting, and urination
* A significant blow to the medulla can cause death
* Involved in reflexes such as gagging

**Pons**

* Plays an important role in sleep and arousal
* Coordinates movements between the left and right sides of the body

**Cerebellum**

* Located behind the medulla and pons
* Essential for proper motor function
* Damage to different parts produces various effects on balance, walking, coordination, and cognitive processes
* Involved in motor learning and motor memory
* Helps organize cognitive and emotional processes

**Midbrain**

* Located above the pons
* Consists of several structures involved in reflexive eye and body movements
* The substantia nigra is a critical region for initiating voluntary movements and producing dopamine, which motivates behavior and controls normal motor function
* Parkinson's disease is caused by the death of substantia nigra cells and the resulting loss of dopamine

### 2.6 FOREBRAIN SUBCORTICAL STRUCTURES CONTROL YOUR MOTIVATIONS AND EMOTIONS

**Forebrain Subcortical Structures**

The forebrain is the part of the brain responsible for complex thoughts, motives, and actions. It consists of the cerebral cortex and several subcortical structures located under the cortex.

**Limbic System**

The limbic system is a neural system located at the border between the hindbrain and cerebral cortex. It plays a crucial role in controlling motivated behaviors, emotions, and forming memories. The limbic system includes the following structures:

- **Thalamus**: a sensory relay station that acts as the gateway to the cortex. It receives almost all incoming sensory information, except for smell, which has a direct route to the cortex. The thalamus organizes and relays this information to the cortex for further processing. During sleep, it partially shuts out incoming sensations to help maintain sleep.
- **Hypothalamus**: a subcortical structure located below the thalamus. It acts as the brain's master regulatory structure and keeps the body in balance by regulating body rhythms, temperature, hunger, and thirst. The hypothalamus also influences basic motivated behaviors such as drinking, eating, aggression, and sex.
- **Hippocampus**: a seahorse-shaped structure located in the medial temporal lobe of the cerebrum. It plays a critical role in forming new memories by creating new neural connections within the cerebral cortex for each new experience. The hippocampus also helps with spatial navigation and memory for locations.
- **Amygdala**: an almond-shaped structure located immediately in front of the hippocampus. It is involved in processing the emotional significance of stimuli, especially fear responses. The amygdala helps us recognize threats and learn to associate things with emotional responses. During times of emotional arousal, it increases memory processing.

### 2.7 THE CEREBRAL CORTEX OF THE FOREBRAIN PROCESSES YOUR COMPLEX MENTAL ACTIVITY

**Cerebral Cortex of the Forebrain**

* The cerebral cortex is the outer layer of the forebrain, responsible for complex mental activity, thoughts, detailed perceptions, and behaviors.
* **It is divided into two hemispheres: left and right. Each hemisphere contains four lobes**: occipital, parietal, temporal, and frontal.

**Lobes of the Cerebral Cortex**

**Occipital Lobes**:

* Located at the back of the head.
* Devoted almost exclusively to vision.
* Contains primary visual cortex and secondary visual areas.

**Parietal Lobes**:

* Devoted partially to touch.
* Each hemisphere receives touch information from opposite sides of the body.
* Information is processed in the primary somatosensory cortex, a strip in the front part of the lobe.
* Also involved in knowing where objects are in space and understanding spatial relationships.

**Temporal Lobes**:

* Hold the primary auditory cortex for hearing.
* Contains visual areas specialized for recognizing detailed objects, such as faces.
* Includes hippocampus and amygdala, critical for memory.
* At the intersection of temporal and occipital lobes is the fusiform face area, responsible for facial recognition.

**Frontal Lobes**:

* Essential for complex thought, planning, and movement.
* Critical for engaging in Monitoring strategy.
* Rear portion is the primary motor cortex, which controls body movements.
* Rest of the frontal lobes consists of prefrontal cortex, responsible for rational thought, social life, attention, self-regulation, and planning.

**Prefrontal Cortex**:

* Occupies about 30% of the human brain.
* Critical for rational thought and human social life.
* Provides sense of self and capacity to understand others' thoughts and emotions.
* Involved in directing and maintaining attention, keeping ideas in mind, and developing plans.
* People with damage to this region have difficulties getting along with others.
* Specific parts are responsible for various functions like attention, self-regulation, and planning.

**Connections Between Hemispheres**:

* The corpus callosum is a massive bridge connecting the two hemispheres, allowing information flow between them.

### The Case of Phineas Gage
**Background**:

- Phineas Gage is a famous historical example of brain damage and its impact on personality and self-control.
- In 1848, Gage was a foreman on the construction of Vermont's Rutland and Burlington Railroad.
- He survived an explosion that drove a tamping iron rod through his left cheek, frontal lobes, and out the top of his head.

**Physical Recovery**:

- Gage recovered remarkably well from the physical injuries.
- However, he experienced significant personality changes.

**Personality Changes**:

- **Old Gage**: regarded as efficient and capable foreman.
- **New Gage**: fitful, irreverent, impatient, and socially unskilled.
- Could not get his job back; exhibited himself in various towns and at the New York Museum.
- Over time, he adapted to his injury and became more functional.
- Moved to Chile and worked as a stagecoach driver for seven years.
- Returned to the US, experienced health decline, and died in 1860 from epileptic seizures.

**Impact on Brain Science**:

- Initially, medical community believed healthy parts of Gage's brain took over damaged areas.
- Severe psychological impairments led to recognition that some brain areas have specific functions.
- Damage to left prefrontal cortex was most significant (Figure 2.22c).

**Lobotomy**:

- In the late 1930s, lobotomy was developed as a treatment for psychological disorders.
- A deliberate damaging of the prefrontal cortex to manage patients' emotions and impulses.
- Left patients lethargic and emotionally flat but disconnected from social surroundings (similar to Gage).
- Most lobotomies performed in late 1940s and early 1950s.
- Phased out with the arrival of drugs to treat psychological disorders.

**Brain Regions**:

- **Occipital lobes**: important for vision (Figure 2.22a).
- **Parietal lobes**: important for touch, spatial awareness (Figure 2.22b).
- **Temporal lobes**: important for hearing and object recognition (Figure 2.22c).
- **Frontal lobes**: important for movement, planning, complex processes, including rational thought, attention, self-control, and social processes.

### 2.8 THE HEMISPHERES WORK TOGETHER WITH SOME SPECIALIZATION

* The cortex is divided into the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere.
* Each hemisphere processes distinct information but works together in a healthy brain.
* **Left hemisphere**: responsible for logical thought, language, controlling movements on the right side of the body, and processing images from the left visual field.
* **Right hemisphere**: responsible for spatial relationships, recognizing faces, understanding emotional aspects of language, abstract thinking, controlling movements on the left side of the body, and processing images from the right visual field.

**Left Hemisphere Interprets Actions of the Right Hemisphere**

* In split-brain patients, the corpus callosum is severed, isolating the hemispheres.
* Each hemisphere works independently in these patients.
* Psychologists test functions of each hemisphere separately in split-brain patients.
* Split-brain experiments showed that each hemisphere has its own conscious awareness and interprets information differently.
* The left hemisphere tends to create a logical explanation for the actions of the right hemisphere, even if it is unrelated to the actual reason.

**Left Brain/Right Brain Myth**

* Popular notion that people are "left brain" or "right brain" dominant based on their thinking styles.
* Left-brain thinkers are considered more analytical, rational, and objective.
* Right-brain thinkers are considered more creative and holistic.
* No scientific evidence supports the idea of left or right brain dominance.
* Each hemisphere is capable of carrying out most cognitive processes.
* Most cognitive processes involve the coordinated efforts of both hemispheres.

### 2.9 HOW CAN YOU SUCCEED IF YOU HAVE A LEARNING DISABILITY?
#### USING PSYCHOLOGY IN YOUR LIFE 

**Learning Goal**: Summarize what to do if you suspect you have a learning disability and the impact of learning disabilities on success.

A learning disability is a neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to receive, process, store, or respond to information (Cortiella & Horowitz, 2014). Some common types include:

- **ADHD**: Affects attention and hyperactivity. Michael Phelps is an example of someone with ADHD who has achieved great success.
- **Dyslexia**: Involves problems with processing symbols and sounds in the brain, leading to difficulties with reading, spelling, writing, and math (Snowling & Melby-Lervåg, 2016). People with dyslexia can be creative problem solvers.

**Steps to Take if You Suspect a Learning Disability**:

1. **Contact your campus's office for disability support services or student affairs**: This may include the dean of students, a director of residential life, or a mental health counselor.
2. **Get your learning disability verified**: Schools are required to provide equal opportunities for people with learning disabilities.
3. **Receive accommodations and resources**: Disability support services staff will work with you to understand your needs and communicate them to your professors without revealing the specific nature of your disability.
4. Speak directly with instructors about your learning disability and needed resources, if desired.
5. Line up necessary resources for academic success.

**Impact of Learning Disabilities on Success**:

People with learning disabilities have achieved great success in various fields:

- Whoopi Goldberg (actor, writer, talk-show host) - Dyslexia
- Richard Branson (entrepreneur)
- Magic Johnson (basketball player)
- Jamie Oliver (celebrity chef)

### 2.10 THE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INCLUDES THE SOMATIC AND AUTONOMIC SYSTEMS

- **Two primary subdivisions**: somatic nervous system and autonomic nervous system

**Somatic Nervous System**

- Transmits signals to and from the Central Nervous System (CNS) through nerves
- Controls all voluntary movements
- Receptors in skin, muscles, and joints send sensory information to the spinal cord and brain
- CNS sends signals to muscles, joints, and skin to initiate or inhibit movement

**Autonomic Nervous System**

- Automatically regulates the body's internal environment
- Stimulates glands and maintains internal organs
- **Two further subdivisions**: sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system

- **Sympathetic Nervous System**
  - Prepares the body for action
  - Activates responses during stress or excitement
  - Increases heart rate, blood sugar, breathing, and pupil dilation
  - Nonverbal cues during attraction or anxiety
- **Parasympathetic Nervous System**
  - Calms the body and returns it to a resting state
  - Slows heart rate, decreases breathing, and reduces perspiration
  - Balances sympathetic nervous system's effects

### 2.11 THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM AFFECTS YOUR BEHAVIOR THROUGH HORMONES

* The endocrine system is a communication network that influences various aspects of the body, including mental activity and behavior.
* **The main difference between the endocrine and nervous systems is their methods of communication**: the nervous system uses electrochemical signals while the endocrine system releases hormones into the bloodstream.
* Hormones are chemicals released by endocrine glands (pineal, adrenal, pituitary, thyroid, testes or ovaries) that travel through the bloodstream to target tissues, affecting mental activity and behavior.
* Hormonal influences on behavior include sexual development and physical growth.

**Sexual Development and Hormones**

* The gonads (testes in males, ovaries in females) are the primary endocrine glands influencing sexual behavior.
* Androgens (e.g., testosterone) and estrogens (e.g., estradiol) are hormones produced by the gonads; males produce more androgens, while females produce more estrogens.
* Gonadal hormones influence secondary sex characteristics and adult sexual behavior.

**Physical Growth and Hormones**

* Growth hormone (GH) promotes bone, cartilage, and muscle tissue growth or regeneration after injury.
* GH is used to increase body size and strength in some athletes, but there is little evidence of performance enhancement for those with normal levels.
* The use of GH is banned in most athletic competitions.

**Biological Psychology in the Workplace**

* Understanding biological psychology is essential in various occupations, particularly healthcare and health-related fields.
* Pharmacists need to understand neurotransmitters and their effects on medications.
* Neuroprosthetics specialists collaborate with medical professionals to develop technologies for people with neurological disorders or limb differences.
* Physical therapists use knowledge of brain functions to help clients with damage to specific brain areas.
* Neuromarketers use neuroscientific approaches to predict consumer behavior in response to advertisements and products.

### 2.12 YOUR GENES AFFECT YOUR MENTAL ACTIVITY AND BEHAVIOR

* **Natural Selection** and the Evolution of the Human Mind**:
	+ Charles Darwin's theory explaining how species change over generations through adaptations to environments.
	+ Individuals with beneficial traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on these traits to their offspring.
	+ Natural selection plays a role in shaping the human mind and brain, helping people adapt to their environments and ensure survival of their offspring.
* **Genotype vs. Phenotype**:
	+ **Genotype**: The genetic makeup of an organism, set at the moment of conception and never changes. It determines an organism's characteristics.
	+ **Phenotype**: Observable physical and psychological traits that result from the interaction between an organism's genotype and its environment. They can change over time.
* **Influence of Genes on Human Traits**:
	+ Genes influence not only physical characteristics but also predispositions to diseases, personality, intelligence, and athletic talent.
	+ Recent genetic research focuses on gene expression, which is influenced by environmental factors.
* **Interplay of Nature and Nurture**:
	+ Both genetics (nature) and environment (nurture) contribute to who we are.
	+ Genes lay the groundwork for many human traits, but their expression can vary based on environmental influences and experiences.
* **Example: Alcoholism and Environment**:
	+ Inheriting a predisposition to alcoholism (nature) doesn't guarantee that an individual will develop the condition if they are raised in a nondrinking environment and surround themselves with moderate social drinkers (nurture).

### 2.13 YOUR GENES INTERACT WITH YOUR ENVIRONMENT TO INFLUENCE YOU

* **Behavioral Genetics**: field of study that examines how genes and environment interact to influence mental activity and behavior
* **Twin Studies**: method used in behavioral genetics to assess the degree to which traits are inherited by comparing similarities between different types of twins

**Types of Twins**

* **Monozygotic (Identical) Twins**: result from one zygote dividing in two, sharing the same genetic makeup and biological sex
	+ Similarities between monozygotic twins are most likely due to genotypes (genetic influences), although environment also plays a role
* **Dizygotic (Fraternal) Twins**: result from two separately fertilized eggs, no more similar genetically than any other pair of siblings

**Twin Studies: Comparing Similarities**

* Researchers focus on a specific trait and compare how similar monozygotic twins are in phenotypes (observable traits) with how similar dizygotic twins are
* Increased similarity in that trait for monozygotic twins is considered most likely due to genotypes, although environment still has important effects

**Adoption Studies**

* Compare the similarities between biological relatives and adoptive relatives
* Similarities among adopted siblings who are not biologically related have more to do with environment than with genes

**Examples of Twin Studies**

* **Gerald Levey and Mark Newman**: identical twins separated at birth, reunited as adults, discovered they were both firefighters and had similar personality traits
* **Minnesota Twin Project**: study of over 100 pairs of identical and fraternal twins, some raised together and some raised apart, found that identical twins were likely to be similar in various characteristics regardless of whether they were raised together or apart

**Epigenetics**

* New field of genetic study focusing on how environment affects gene expression
* Environment does not alter genes themselves but alters how or when those genes are expressed
* Changes in gene expression can be passed along to future generations, creating tags on genes that tell them when to express and these tags are passed along with the genes to future generations.

**Glossary**

* **Monozygotic Twins**: identical twins; these siblings result from one zygote splitting in two, so they share the same genes
* **Dizygotic Twins**: fraternal twins; these siblings result from two separately fertilized eggs, so they are no more similar genetically than nontwin siblings are.

### 2.14 YOUR ENVIRONMENT CHANGES YOUR BRAIN

**2.14 Your Environment Changes Your Brain**: This section discusses brain plasticity and how it allows the brain to adapt and change in response to experiences and injuries.

**Three Types of Brain Plasticity**: **The brain can change in three ways**: by growing new neurons, changing existing neural connections, and reorganizing.

*Michelle Mack's Case:* Michelle was born with a missing left hemisphere due to a stroke in the womb. Despite this, she was able to lead a surprisingly independent life due to her right hemisphere taking over the duties of the left hemisphere. This shows the plasticity of the brain and how experiences can influence its development.

**Growing New Neurons**:
- Brain plasticity decreases with age, but even in old age, the brain can grow new neurons and connections.
- Neurogenesis is the production of new neurons, which occurs mainly in the hippocampus, a region involved in memory storage.
- Controversy exists regarding the extent of neurogenesis in adults.

**Changing Existing Neural Connections**:
- As we learn new things, neural connections strengthen or weaken based on usage.
- The theory of "neurons that fire together wire together" explains how neurons form permanent connections through repeated activation.
- Pruning is the process by which overabundant connections are eliminated to strengthen the remaining ones.
- Much neural pruning occurs during childhood, resulting in a more efficient brain.

**Brain Reorganization**:
- Following injury or damage to certain areas of the brain, nearby regions can take on their functions through new connections.
- Brain reorganization is more common in children than adults and plays a major role in recovery from brain injuries.

**Neural Pruning**: During neural development, overabundant connections form among neurons. Subsequently, life experiences help "prune" some of these connections to strengthen the rest, making the brain more efficient. This process occurs mainly during childhood.

## 3 CONSCIOUSNESS

**Key Questions**:
- What does it mean to be conscious?
- How does sleep affect consciousness?
- How do hypnosis and meditation alter consciousness?
- How do drugs alter consciousness?

**What Does It Mean to Be Conscious?**

**Consciousness is Your Subjective Experience**:
- **Consciousness**: moment-by-moment awareness of experiences, both external and internal.
  - Result of brain activity.
  - Subjective and unique to each person.
- **Introspection**: early method of understanding consciousness through self-reporting, but subjective and unreliable.

**Your Experience of Consciousness Varies**:
- **Awareness level**: conscious vs. unconscious.
- **State clarity**: normal waking state of consciousness vs. altered states.
- **Objective vs. subjective**: objective information exists apart from personal opinion, subjective information is based on personal perspective.
- Consciousness can be understood in terms of awareness level and state clarity.

**Why Psychologists Abandoned Introspection**:
- Subjective and unique to each person.
- Lack of reliability across individuals.
- **Modern methods**: observable behavior, brain imaging, etc. have led to a better understanding of consciousness.

**Changes in Consciousness**:
- **Sudden changes**: soccer player's concussion.
- **Positive changes**: meditation.
- **Negative changes**: coma.

**Concussion and Impaired Consciousness**:
- Risky sports and recreational activities.
- Concussions can occur without loss of consciousness.
- Symptoms include headaches, dizziness, mental confusion, difficulty concentrating, and light sensitivity.
- Long-term impairments.

**Brittni Souder's Story**:
- Former college soccer star.
- Suffered multiple concussions.
- Impaired vision, memory, and concentration.

**Conclusion**:
- Consciousness is a complex phenomenon that can change in an instant.
- Understanding consciousness requires considering both subjective experience and objective observation.
- Modern methods have led to significant advances in understanding consciousness.

### 3.2 CONSCIOUSNESS RESULTS FROM BRAIN ACTIVITY

**Materialism and the Global Workspace Model**

**Key Concepts**: Consciousness, Mind/Body Problem, Dualism, Materialism, Global Workspace Model, Neurons, Brain Regions, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Coma

**Materialism vs. Dualism**:

* Long-standing philosophical debate on the nature of consciousness
* **Mind/body problem**: Is mind and body separate or inseparable?
* **Dualism (René Descartes)**: Mind is separate from the body; body is an organic machine governed by reflex, rational mind is divine
* **Materialism**: Brain and mind are inseparable; processing of information in the brain creates experiences of the mind
  * Activity of neurons in the brain produces consciousness

**Global Workspace Model**:

* Consciousness depends on which brain circuits are active
* Specific areas of the brain process certain types of information, producing conscious experience
* No one area is responsible for general awareness
* Damage to specific brain regions negatively affects consciousness

**Brain Activity and Consciousness**:

* Studies examining relationship between neural responses in the brain and consciousness
* **Tong et al. (1998) study**: Participants reported seeing faces or houses, fMRI measured neural responses; different brain areas process different types of sensory information and are associated with awareness
* Brain activity patterns reveal emotional states, self-referential thoughts, etc.

**Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)**:

* External trauma causes changes in consciousness and physical damage to the brain
* Ranges from mild to severe; severe TBIs responsible for 30% of injury deaths
* Long-term effects on thinking, memory, emotions, personality
* Concussions are a type of TBI
* Increased risk of multiple sclerosis later in life for adolescents who suffer concussions
* Guidelines for reducing occurrence of injuries among young athletes

**Coma**:

* Appears unconscious and unresponsive, but some patients may be conscious but unable to communicate
* Brain imaging shows similar neural activity between coma patients and control subjects during mental tasks
* 54 coma patients found to have conscious awareness and ability to willfully control brain activity to communicate
* Recommended use of brain imaging to assess consciousness in comas
* Some people in comas are conscious but unable to respond, in a minimally conscious state
* **Unresponsive wakefulness syndrome**: Long-term unresponsiveness not associated with consciousness
* **Terri Schiavo case**: 15 years in unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, cortical areas of her brain completely destroyed, unconscious due to irreversible damage.

### 3.3 CONSCIOUSNESS INVOLVES ATTENTION

**Limited Capacity and Impact on Automatic and Controlled Processes**

**Key Concept**: **The text discusses the relationship between attention, consciousness, and the two types of processing**: automatic and controlled. It highlights how limited attention affects these processes and the dangers of distracted driving.

**Limited Attention and Consciousness**:

- Attention is the focusing of mental resources on specific information to become consciously aware of it.
- We have a "two-track mind" with automatic and controlled processing.
- Automatic processing requires less attention, but we are less aware of external stimuli and inner mental activity.
- Controlled processing requires more attention, leading to greater awareness of experiences and mental activity.

**Automatic Processing**:

- Uses less attention and is associated with less awareness of details.
- **Examples**: Driving on autopilot or reading a familiar text.
- Can be dangerous when driving in difficult conditions as we may not fully attend to the situation.

**Controlled Processing**:

- Requires more attention, leading to greater awareness of experiences and mental activity.
- **Examples**: Solving complex problems or learning new skills.
- Can be beneficial when driving in challenging conditions as it helps us focus on potential hazards.

**Distracted Driving**:

- Diverting attention from the road can lead to accidents, even with hands-free devices.
- The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports approximately 23,000 deaths due to distracted driving between 2012 and 2018.
- Many states have enacted laws against using handheld devices or texting while driving.

**Limited Attention**:

- We cannot consciously process an infinite amount of information at once.
- Multitasking can negatively impact attention, leading to poor performance and negative consequences such as anxiety, depression, obesity, and sleep problems.
- Research shows that multitasking has a variety of negative consequences for children and young adults.

**Inattentional Blindness**:

- Attention is limited, and we can miss important visual information when our attention is directed elsewhere.
- An example of inattentional blindness is the "Gorilla Experiment," where participants fail to notice a gorilla passing by while focusing on another task.

**Glossary**:

- **Attention**: The focusing of mental resources on specific information to become consciously aware of it.
- **Inattentional blindness**: A failure to be aware of visual information when one's attention is directed elsewhere.

### 3.4 UNCONSCIOUS PROCESSING SOMETIMES AFFECTS BEHAVIOR

* **Sigmund Freud's theory**: much human behavior is determined by unconscious mental processes (below conscious awareness)
* Unconscious forces include repressed childhood experiences and conflicting sexual urges
* **Goal of therapy**: bring unconscious contents into conscious awareness

**Unconscious Processing and Inattentional Blindness**

* **Freudian slip**: expressing an unconscious thought inappropriately
* **Subliminal perception**: processing stimuli without conscious awareness
* **Inattentional blindness**: failure to notice visual information due to lack of attention

**Research on Inattentional Blindness**

* Participants give directions to strangers, some replaced without noticing
* **Results**: half the participants didn't notice they were talking to a different person
* **Conclusion**: inattentional blindness results from lack of conscious awareness of certain visual information

**Unconscious Processing and Subliminal Perception**

* Unconscious processing can influence thoughts and behavior without conscious awareness
* **Classic experiment by Nisbett & Wilson (1977)**: participants influenced by subliminal word pairs
* Participants unaware of the influence on their choices
* Subliminal cues have little effect on complex behaviors like voting or purchasing decisions
* Most powerful effects on motivational states, such as thirst and hunger

**Sleep and Consciousness**

* Brain activity continues during sleep, some regions more active than when awake
* Complex thinking occurs during sleep, including problem-solving
* **Consciousness during sleep**: aware of outer world and mental processes
* **Dreaming**: brain activity that results in vivid experiences while asleep

### 3.5 CONSCIOUSNESS CHANGES DURING SLEEP

**Learning Goals**:
- Understand the concept of circadian rhythms and their role in sleep.
- Learn about the four stages of healthy sleep and their characteristics.
- Identify key features of each sleep stage, such as brain activity, consciousness levels, and REM (Rapid Eye Movement) or non-REM (Non-Rapid Eye Movement) sleep.

**Key Concepts**:
1. **Circadian rhythms**: Regular, daily patterns that regulate various biological processes, including sleep/wake cycles. They are influenced by light and dark cycles and can be affected by melatonin production.
2. **Melatonin**: A hormone produced by the pineal gland that helps regulate circadian rhythms and promotes sleep. Its production is triggered by darkness and inhibited by light.
3. **Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)**: A small region in the hypothalamus responsible for processing information about light and dark cycles, which influences melatonin production and circadian rhythms.
4. **Pineal gland**: An endocrine gland that produces melatonin in response to signals from the SCN.
5. **Sleep stages**: **Healthy sleep consists of four distinct stages**: N1, N2, N3, and R (or REM). Each stage is characterized by specific brain wave patterns and levels of consciousness.

**Summary**:

**Circadian rhythms and Sleep**:
- Our bodies have an internal clock that regulates our sleep/wake cycles, known as circadian rhythms.
- Circadian rhythms are influenced by light and dark cycles and can be affected by melatonin production.
- The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus processes information about light and sends signals to the pineal gland, which influences melatonin production.
- Melatonin helps regulate the accuracy of our biological clock and can be taken as a supplement to help cope with jet lag or shift work.

**The Four Stages of Healthy Sleep**:
1. **Stage N1 (NREM)**: This is the lightest stage of sleep, where you start to drift off. Your awareness of both the outer world and your inner mental activity starts to decline. EEGs show slower theta waves, and you can easily be aroused from this stage. Some people experience hypnic jerks or see fantastical images during this stage.
2. **Stage N2 (NREM)**: In this stage, you are truly asleep, and your breathing becomes more regular. EEGs show large waves called K-complexes and occasional bursts of activity called sleep spindles. Your conscious awareness of both the external world and inner mental activity is much less.
3. **Stage N3 (NREM)**: Also known as slow-wave sleep, this stage is characterized by large, regular delta waves and deep sleep. People in this stage are very hard to wake up and often disoriented when they do. However, they still process some outside information for potential danger.
4. **Stage R (REM) or Stage W**: This is the stage of sleep where you experience rapid eye movements, dreaming, and paralysis of motor systems. EEGs show beta wave activity, which is also associated with an awake, conscious mind. People are more likely to remember their dreams during this stage.

**Sleep Cycle**:
Over the course of a typical night, you cycle through these stages about five times. The sleep cycle starts with N1, then progresses to N2 and N3, and finally reverses back to REM sleep. As morning approaches, the sleep cycle becomes shorter, and you spend relatively more time in REM sleep. People briefly awaken many times during the night but usually do not remember these awakenings. As people age, they sometimes have more difficulty going back to sleep after awakening and spend less time in deep N3 sleep.

**Review & Apply**:
Classify each of the following according to the sleep stage in which they occur: a) sleep spindles b) dreams c) hypnic jerks d) delta waves

a. Sleep spindles - Stage N2 (NREM)
b. Dreams - Stage R (REM) or Stage W
c. Hypnic jerks - Stage N1 (NREM)
d. Delta waves - Stage N3 (NREM)

### 3.6 PEOPLE DREAM WHILE SLEEPING

- Dreams are a mystery, as they are products of our consciousness during sleep that often feel real.
- People tend to have social dreams involving interactions with known and unknown individuals, even the deceased.
- Keeping a dream journal can help identify repeating patterns in dreams.

**Brain Activity and Dreaming**:
- Everyone dreams unless injured or medicated, spending an average of 6 years of their life dreaming.
- Dreams occur during both REM (Rapid Eye Movement) and non-REM sleep.

**REM and Non-REM Dreams**:
- *REM Sleep:*
  - Content is more likely to be bizarre, involving intense emotions, hallucinations, and illogical events.
  - Brain regions associated with motivation, reward, emotion (amygdala), visual association areas, motor cortex, and brain stem are active.
  - Prefrontal cortex becomes less active, leading to emotional images without rational thought.
- *Non-REM Sleep:*
  - Dreams feel normal and often involve everyday activities.
  - Brain regions are generally less active compared to REM sleep.

**Interpreting Dreams**:
- **Sigmund Freud's theory**: dreams represent hidden content (latent content) as disguised wish fulfillment of unconscious desires.
- **Activation-synthesis theory**: dreams result from the brain trying to make sense of random neural firing during sleep.

**Conclusion**:
- Dreams are a complex phenomenon that can be influenced by daily life experiences and brain activity.
- Understanding the relationship between brain activity and dreaming is an ongoing area of research.

### 3.7 SLEEP IS AN ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR

Sleep is a necessary behavior for all animals, including humans, despite the potential risks of being vulnerable during that time. Research suggests that sleep serves important biological functions that help us adapt and respond in our environment. Three main theories explain why sleeping is adaptive: restoration of the body, preservation from harm, and support for memory and learning.

**Three Benefits of Sleep**:

1. **Restoration Theory**: Sleep allows the body to rest and repair itself, including the brain. Growth hormone released during deep sleep helps repair damaged tissue, and sleep strengthens the immune system. After physically demanding activities or traumatic brain injuries, people require more sleep for restoration.
2. **Circadian Rhythm Theory**: Sleep preserves animals from harm by keeping them quiet and inactive when danger is greatest, usually during the night. Humans, who depend on vision for survival, are adapted to sleeping at night due to our early ancestors' increased risk in the dark.
3. **Consolidation Theory**: Sleep strengthens neural connections that serve as the basis of learning by consolidating circuits wired together during the waking period. Recent research suggests that sleep spindles play an important role in memory consolidation during sleep.

**Sleep Deprivation and Its Effects**:

Although occasional lack of sleep may not have significant effects on physical abilities, prolonged sleep deprivation can lead to numerous problems:

* Difficulty performing quiet tasks and nearly impossible performing mundane tasks
* Attention lapses and reduced short-term memory
* Compromised immune system and potential death (in extreme cases)
* Microsleeps, which can cause accidents and injuries
* Interference with hunger signals, contributing to overeating and weight gain
* Negative mental health effects, including depression, anxiety, and mood impairment
* Impaired motor abilities
* Decreased attractiveness to others

**Factors Affecting Sleep**:

Modern technology, such as mobile devices, can negatively impact sleep quality and duration. Using a smartphone while in bed is associated with less time sleeping and poorer sleep quality due to notifications interrupting sleep. To improve sleep, it's recommended to turn off or mute notifications and use airport mode when possible.

**Marathon and Sleep**:

The restoration theory best explains why someone might sleep for 12 hours after running a marathon. The intense physical activity requires the body to repair and recover, which is facilitated by extended sleep.

### 3.8 HOW CAN YOU DEVELOP BETTER SLEEP HABITS?

* **Establish a routine**: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day to help set your biological clock.
* **Avoid alcohol and caffeine in the evening**: Alcohol interferes with sleep cycle, while caffeine is a stimulant that prevents falling asleep.
* **Limit electronic device use before bed**: Blue light emitted by most devices reduces melatonin production and signals the brain to remain awake.
* **Exercise regularly**: Regular exercise helps maintain sleep cycle and promotes slow-wave sleep at night.
* **Use your bed only for sleeping**: Make your bed a place for rest and relaxation.
* **Relaxation techniques**: Practice relaxation methods, such as warm baths, soothing music, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation to reduce stress and promote sleep.
* **Get up if you can't fall asleep**: Instead of lying in bed trying to force sleep, get up and do something relaxing until you feel drowsy again.
* **Let go of worries**: Write down concerns before going to bed and address them the next day.
* **Maintain a consistent sleep schedule**: Consistent sleep habits help regulate your body's internal clock.

**3.8.1 Why Avoid Using an Electronic Device Just Before Bed?**

Electronic devices emit blue light, which reduces melatonin production and signals the brain to remain awake, making it more difficult to fall asleep. Additionally, using electronic devices before bed can lead to increased anxiety and stress, further hindering the ability to fall asleep.

**Common Sleep Disorders**

**Insomnia**

* A sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling or staying asleep, leading to reduced mental health and daily functioning.
* Approximately 15% of college students report symptoms of insomnia.
* Causes include anxiety about sleep, stress, and irregular sleep schedules.
* Treatment includes cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and avoiding sleeping pills.

**Sleep Apnea**

* A disorder characterized by interrupted breathing during sleep due to the throat closing.
* Most common among middle-aged men and associated with obesity.
* Symptoms include loud snoring, daytime tiredness, and cardiovascular problems.
* Treatment includes using a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device to keep the throat open during sleep.

**Narcolepsy**

* A rare disorder characterized by excessive sleepiness during normal waking hours.
* People with narcolepsy may experience muscle paralysis and "sleep attacks."
* Cause is a genetic condition affecting neurotransmitter transmission in the hypothalamus.
* Treatment includes stimulant drugs to keep the person awake during the day.

**REM Behavior Disorder**

* A disorder characterized by loss of muscle paralysis during REM sleep, causing people to act out their dreams while sleeping.
* Rare condition most commonly seen in older males.
* No treatment exists for this condition.

**Sleepwalking (Somnambulism)**

* A behavior occurring during slow-wave sleep, typically within the first hour or two after falling asleep.
* Most common among young children.
* People with sleepwalking appear glassy-eyed and disconnected from their surroundings.
* No harm is done if a sleepwalker is awakened during an episode.

### 3.10 ATTENTION TO SUGGESTIONS MAY ALTER CONSCIOUSNESS IN HYPNOSIS

**Hypnosis and Attention to Suggestions**

* Hypnosis involves a person experiencing changes in memory, perception, and voluntary action in response to suggestions.
* Psychologists debate whether hypnotists can produce an altered state of consciousness or if it's just good theater.
* Hypnosis uses suggestions to create altered memories, perceptions, and behaviors.
* People may be in an altered state of consciousness during hypnosis or simply following the hypnotist's suggestions.
* Hypnotic sessions can include posthypnotic suggestions that influence behavior after the session.
* Therapists use hypnosis for weight loss, smoking cessation, and pain management.
* Hypnosis relies more on the person being hypnotized than the skill of the hypnotist.
* Suggestibility is related to getting absorbed in activities easily, not being distracted easily, and having a rich imagination.

**Two Theories of Hypnosis**

**Sociocognitive Theory**:

* Some psychologists believe that hypnotized people are aware and willing to perform actions suggested by the hypnotist.
* People behave as they expect hypnotized people to behave, even if their expectations are faulty.

**Dissociation Theory**:

* Another theory suggests that hypnosis is a trancelike state in which conscious awareness is separated from other aspects of consciousness.
* Brain imaging studies have shown alterations in brain activity during hypnosis, implying a real change in consciousness.
* Hypnotic analgesia (pain reduction) provides evidence for the dissociation theory as it's unlikely that people could alter their brain activity to please hypnotists.

**Hypnosis and Pain**

* Hypnosis is effective in pain management, both acute and chronic.
* People high in suggestibility can tolerate more pain during hypnosis.
* Hypnotic analgesia may work by changing the patient's interpretation of pain rather than diminishing it.
* Findings support the dissociation theory as it's unlikely that expectations or social pressure could explain how people experiencing hypnotic analgesia can undergo painful procedures without feeling it.

### 3.11 MEDITATION ALTERS CONSCIOUSNESS AND BRAIN FUNCTIONING

**Meditation and Altered Consciousness**

* People in the West are interested in Eastern techniques for creating an altered state of consciousness, one such technique is meditation.
* Meditation is a practice that leads to a deep sense of calmness and has been used in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sikhism for spiritual enlightenment.
* In the West, meditation is often practiced for expanding the mind, inner peace, and stress relief.
* **Two main forms of meditation**:
  * **Mindfulness meditation**: Letting thoughts flow freely without examining their meaning or reacting to them.
  * **Concentrative meditation**: Focusing attention on one thing, such as breathing pattern, mental image, or specific phrase (mantra).
* Transcendental meditation (TM) is a popular form of meditation in the West, involves meditating with great concentration for 20 minutes twice a day.
* **Studies suggest that meditation has positive effects on health and cognitive processing**:
  * Improved stress reduction and attention (Tang et al., 2007).
  * Reduced sadness and emotional response to sad stimuli (Farb et al., 2010).
* Long-term meditation may bring structural changes in the brain that help maintain brain function over the life span.

**Impact of Meditation on Brain Functioning**

* Meditation has been shown to produce an altered state of consciousness, leading to feelings of calmness and inner peace.
* **Different forms of meditation have various effects on brain activity**:
  * **Mindfulness meditation**: Increased activity in the prefrontal cortex and decreased activity in the amygdala (Farb et al., 2010).
  * **Concentrative meditation**: Increased activity in the parietal lobe, which is involved in focusing attention (Cahn & Polich, 2006).
* Long-term meditation practice may lead to structural changes in the brain, such as increased gray matter density in areas related to attention and emotional regulation (Davidson et al., 2003).

**Evaluating Psychology in the Real World: You're Stressed Out... Can Meditation Help?**

* NPR article discusses how meditation may help reduce anxiety and depression.
* **Evaluate the claim by asking**:
  * Is the source believable? (NPR is a reputable news organization)
  * Is there strong evidence for the claim? (Yes, several studies have shown positive effects of meditation on stress, anxiety, and depression)
  * Do other believable sources agree about the claim? (Yes, many scientific studies support the benefits of meditation for mental health)
* If you found that the evidence supports the claim, how might this information change how you think and act? (Consider trying mindfulness meditation as a way to reduce stress and improve mental well-being)

### 3.12 PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS AFFECT THE BRAIN

* Psychoactive drugs alter consciousness by interacting with neurotransmitter systems in the brain.
* **Four main classes of psychoactive drugs**: Stimulants, Depressants, Opioids, and Hallucinogens.

**Table 3.1: Four Classes of Psychoactive Drugs**

| Class of Drug          | Examples                   | Psychological Effects         | Neurotransmitter System(s) |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Stimulants            | Amphetamines, cocaine      | Increase behavior and mental activity | Dopamine, norepinephrine   |
| Depressants           | Anti-anxiety drugs (benzodiazepines), alcohol | Decrease behavior and mental activity | GABA                     |
| Opioids               | Heroin, morphine          | Reduce pain and bring pleasure    | Endorphins              |
| Hallucinogens         | LSD, peyote, psilocybin mushrooms, MDMA (ecstasy), cannabis | Change perceptions, thoughts, and emotions | Serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, cannabinoid |


**Stimulants**

* Activate the sympathetic nervous system, increasing heart rate and blood pressure
* Improve mood but make people restless and disrupt sleep
* **Many substances act as stimulants**: caffeine, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamines
* Dopamine is involved in drug use for increased reward and desire
* Cocaine was once an ingredient in Coca-Cola before being outlawed
* Amphetamines are used to treat ADHD and as a study aid
* Methamphetamine damages the brain, particularly the frontal lobes and temporal lobes

**Depressants**

* Reduce behavioral and mental activity by slowing down the central nervous system
* Anti-anxiety drugs (benzodiazepines) are depressants
* Alcohol is a widely abused depressant
* Depressants activate GABA receptors, inhibiting neural activity
* In large doses, depressants can cause sleep

**Opioids**

* Reduce pain and bring pleasure
* Endorphins are natural opioids in the body
* Heroin, morphine, and codeine are examples of opioids

**Hallucinogens**

* Change perceptions, thoughts, and emotions
* MDMA (ecstasy) may also increase behavior and mental activity
* Cannabis may also increase or decrease behavior and mental activity
* Serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and cannabinoid are neurotransmitter systems involved in hallucinogenic effects.

#### Alcohol

- Most widely used and abused drug
- Depressant that activates dopamine receptors but interferes with memory processes
- Can cause severe memory loss, mental decline, and extensive brain damage (Korsakoff's syndrome)
- **Societal issues**: spousal abuse, violence, traffic fatalities, and increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases
- Cost of problem drinking in the US is approximately $250 billion each year
- Men drink more than women across various measures
- Viewed as a "magic elixir" capable of increasing social skills, sexual pleasure, confidence, and power
- Interferes with anxiety processing and increases focus on problems (if drunk before anxiety-provoking events)
- Expectations about alcohol's effects are learned early in life through observation

### Opioids

- Used to relieve pain for hundreds of years
- Short-term use benefits include relief from severe pain, but long-term use can lead to substance use disorder
- Opioid drugs bind with endorphin receptors to produce feelings of relaxation, insensitivity to pain, and euphoria
- Heroin provides intense pleasure and leads to addiction due to its dual physical effects
- Current opioid abuse epidemic results from greater prescription use for chronic pain and subsequent abuse and addiction
- Fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid, is often mixed with heroin or used as a substitute, leading to increased risks and fatalities.

**Increased use of potent opioid mixes has led to a surge in overdoses and fatalities.**
* The COVID-19 pandemic worsened the situation with a 25% increase in opioid overdose deaths in the US through the first half of 2020.
* White middle-aged males are most affected, having the highest death rates from opioid overdoses.
* Opioid use by high school students has decreased.
* First responders carry naloxone to reverse opioid effects and help survivors.
* FDA is establishing guidelines for safe and effective pain medication use for chronic pain sufferers.
* Clinicians must be cautious when prescribing opioids for long-term use.

### Hallucinogens:

* Hallucinogens alter sensation and perception, producing extreme hallucinations.
* LSD was discovered in 1938 from ergot fungus; effects last about 12 hours.
* Natural substances like peyote cactus and psilocybin mushrooms also have psychedelic properties.
* MDMA (ecstasy) produces energizing effect, slight hallucinations, and serotonin release.
* Controversial for long-term use due to potential brain damage; some benefits in PTSD treatment.
* Cannabis is unique as it can be a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogen.
* THC produces relaxed mental state, uplifted mood, and perceptual distortions.
* Increased use by teenagers and young adults is concerning due to potential psychological disorders and suicide risk.
* Medicinal properties include dealing with nausea, chronic pain, and cancer treatment.

### 3.13 SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER HAS PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS

**Substance Use Disorder**: A psychological disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to use a drug despite negative consequences. It has both physical and psychological aspects.

**Factors Leading to Substance Use Disorder**:

* Drugs can have negative consequences, including substance abuse and death. In the US, more people die from drug overdoses than traffic accidents.
* Substance use disorder is a result of physical and psychological dependence.

**Physical Dependence**:

* A person develops a tolerance to the effects of a drug, requiring them to consume more to achieve the same effect.
* Withdrawal symptoms occur when a person fails to ingest the drug, including anxiety, tension, cravings, and physical symptoms like nausea, chills, body aches, and tremors.

**Psychological Dependence**:

* People can also become psychologically dependent on behaviors like shopping, gambling, or social media use.
* Substance use disorder develops through a vicious cycle of increased dopamine activity leading to tolerance, loss of enjoyment, and continued drug use to escape negative feelings.

**Careers Involved in Substance Abuse**:

* Understanding substance use disorder is essential for careers in substance abuse counseling and prevention.
* Knowledge about drugs' effects on consciousness and why people use them is valuable in various mental health settings, schools, prisons, and other industries.

**Predisposing Factors to Substance Use Disorder**:

* **Genetic predisposition**: People inherit a cluster of characteristics that make some more vulnerable to substance abuse.
* **Environmental factors**: Stressful or disadvantaged environments can increase the risk of developing substance use disorders.
* **Social learning**: Parents, peers, and media influence drug use through modeling behavior and social norms.

**Difference Between Tolerance and Withdrawal**:

* **Tolerance**: A physical aspect of substance use disorder where a person needs to take larger doses of a drug to experience its effect.
* **Withdrawal**: A physical and psychological aspect of substance use disorder that occurs when a person experiences anxiety, tension, and cravings after stopping use of a drug.

## 4 DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN

**Big Questions**
- How does development happen in the womb?
- How do infants and children develop?
- How do adolescents develop?
- How do adults develop?
- Are you the same person you were at age 8?

**Prenatal Development**

**How Does Development Happen in the Womb?**

**Developmental Areas**:
1. **Physical**: shifts in hormone levels, growth of the body, changes in the brain.
2. **Socio-emotional**: understanding ourselves, interacting with others, regulating emotions.
3. **Cognitive**: thinking, reasoning, communicating.

**Three Key Periods**:
1. **Germinal period**: conception to two weeks after conception.
   - Zygote forms and implants in the uterus.
2. **Embryonic period**: three to eight weeks after conception.
   - Organs develop, including brain and spinal cord.
3. **Fetal period**: nine weeks after conception until birth.
   - Organs start to function; fetus grows in length and weight.

**Germinal Period**:
- **Begins with conception**: sperm meets egg, forms zygote.
- Zygote divides rapidly, implants in uterine wall by end of two weeks.
- Problems during this period usually result in miscarriage.

**Embryonic Period**:
- Developing human is called an embryo.
- **Most important time for physical development**: spinal cord, brain, internal organs.
- Birth defects may result if development goes wrong; miscarriage remains a threat.
- Nutritional deficiencies can cause serious birth defects (e.g., folic acid).

**Fetal Period**:
- Developing human is called a fetus.
- No new structures develop, but birth defects remain possible and miscarriage is still a threat through week 20.
- **Fetus's whole body changes physically**: muscles begin to move, eyes finish developing, organs finish developing.
- Brain begins to process sensory input and motor output.
- Problems in physical development at any point during prenatal period may affect psychological development after birth.

**Impact of Premature Birth**:
- Most healthy full-term pregnancies end with the birth of a baby 38 to 42 weeks after conception.
- Fetus is thought to be fully developed and able to live outside the womb at 28 weeks of gestation.
- Modern medical technology has made it possible for fetuses to live outside the womb much earlier in their development.
- Premature birth can lead to negative outcomes, but not always (e.g., Amillia Sonja Taylor).

### 4.2 THERE ARE EXTERNAL THREATS TO PRENATAL DEVELOPMENT

* **Teratogens**: Substances that can harm prenatal development (teratos = monster in Greek)
	+ Drugs (nicotine, cannabis, cocaine, opioids, alcohol)
	+ Infections (German measles, syphilis)
	+ Environmental factors (X-rays, mercury)
* Impact depends on timing, amount, and duration of exposure
* Physical effects may be apparent at birth or later in life
* Effects on cognitive functioning, language, reasoning, attention, social behavior, emotions
* No safe exposure standards
* Mothers and fathers should be cautious

**Drugs as Teratogens**

* Affect mother and developing child
* Use during pregnancy can impact long-term development
* **Prevalence**: 4.4% of pregnant women in US use recreational drugs (likely higher due to cannabis legalization and opioid epidemic)
* Premature birth, complications associated with drug use during pregnancy
* **Opioids**: 40-80% of infants exposed show withdrawal symptoms as newborns
	+ Increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome
* Cannabis use linked to impairments in cognitive functioning and mental health

**Alcohol as a Teratogen**

* Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) results in physical abnormalities, low birth weight, intellectual disabilities, behavioral problems
	+ 1 in 8 unborn babies exposed to alcohol in US
* Damage to sperm from excessive alcohol use by fathers increases likelihood of FAS

**Zika Virus as a Teratogen**

* Spread mainly by infected mosquitoes or sexual activity
* Can cause microcephaly and brain abnormalities (6% of infants exposed have virus-related defects)

**Infant and Child Development**

* Babies arrive with basic abilities for survival
	+ Sucking, crying, smiling, bonding, remembering, learning
* **Infancy**: lasts from birth to 18-24 months
* **Childhood**: lasts from age 2 to about ages 11-14
* Times of great change in physical, cognitive, and socio-emotional development

### 4.3 INFANTS AND CHILDREN CHANGE PHYSICALLY
1
**Brain Development**: **As infants and children mature, their brains undergo two critical changes**: myelination and synaptic connections formation. Myelination insulates neurons and improves communication between them. By age 4, the human brain has grown to about 80% of its adult size due to myelination and new synaptic connections, particularly in the frontal lobes. 

Neural pruning occurs later, eliminating unused connections to make information processing more efficient. Environmental stimulation is crucial for optimal brain development; neglect can lead to underdeveloped brains, while rich experiences encourage growth.

* **Myelination and Synaptic Connections**: Myelin insulates axons, allowing efficient communication between neurons. New synaptic connections form during this period, giving the brain the potential to adapt to any environment.
* **Neural Pruning**: Unused synapses decay, allowing for more efficient information processing. Brain development continues throughout adolescence and beyond.
* **Environmental Impact on Brain Development**: Proper stimulation is essential for optimal brain development. Neglect can lead to underdeveloped brains, while rich experiences encourage growth. Poverty, chronic violence, or abuse during childhood can negatively impact brain development.

**Motor Skills**:
* **Innate Reflexes**: Infants have innate reflexes like rooting, sucking, and grasping that help them survive.
* **Development of Motor Skills**: Infants progress from moving their heads to sitting up, standing, and walking in a predictable sequence. Cultural practices can influence the development of motor skills.

**Sensory Development**: Infants learn by gathering information through their senses. Some sensory abilities are more fully developed at birth than others, with those directly connected to survival being the most advanced.

* **Hearing**: Newborns have well-developed hearing abilities and can recognize their mother's voice.
* **Smell**: Infants have a good sense of smell, especially for scents associated with feeding.
* **Taste**: 2-hour-old infants prefer sweet tastes due to their survival instincts.
* **Vision**: Newborns have poor vision but are prewired to respond to human faces and high-contrast patterns.

### 4.4 INFANTS AND CHILDREN CHANGE SOCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY

**Infants and Children's Social and Emotional Development**: The Process of Attachment

**Learning Goal**: Explain the process of attachment in infants and children.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Attachment**: an enduring emotional connection that motivates care, protection, and social support.
- **Secure attachment**: a type of attachment where infants are confident and comforted by their caregiver's presence.
- **Avoidant attachment**: a type of attachment where infants do not show distress when separated from their caregiver and may prefer the company of strangers.
- **Ambivalent attachment**: a type of attachment where infants display mixed feelings towards their caregiver, crying for comfort but also rejecting it.

**Process of Attachment**:

Humans are social animals that develop socially and emotionally through interactions with others. Early experiences with primary caregivers are critical in developing the bonds essential for socio-emotional development. Infants have a fundamental need to bond emotionally with their caregivers, which can aid in their survival.

**Early Attachment**:
Infants display behaviors that motivate adults to care for them, such as smiling and crying. Caregivers shape an infant's early experience through communication, social connections, and nurturing. During the late 1950s, it was believed infants mainly needed food from their mothers; however, Harry Harlow's research showed that comforting touch is critical in socio-emotional development.

**Harlow's Monkeys and Their "Mothers"**:
Harlow conducted an experiment with infant rhesus monkeys to investigate the importance of comfort over food in attachment formation. He found that infants preferred a cloth mother for comfort over a wire mother that provided milk, demonstrating the significance of emotional connection.

**Variations in Attachment**:
At around 8-12 months, infants begin to crawl or toddle and show signs of separation anxiety when they cannot see their attachment figures. The strange-situation test was developed by Mary Ainsworth to study variations in infant attachment. Securely attached infants are confident in unfamiliar environments with their caregiver present and readily comforted upon return. Avoidant infants do not show distress when separated from their caregiver and may prefer the company of strangers. Ambivalent infants display mixed feelings towards their caregiver, crying for comfort but also rejecting it.

**Secure Attachment**:
Approximately 60-65% of infants exhibit secure attachment, which is related to better socio-emotional functioning in childhood, better peer relations, and better self-control.

**Criticisms**:
One criticism of this line of research is that it has primarily focused on children raised in Western cultures, where parents are encouraged to be near their children at all times. Children from other cultures might react differently due to cultural norms rather than attachment styles.

### 4.5 INFANTS AND CHILDREN CHANGE COGNITIVELY

**Cognitive Development in Infants and Children**

**Learning Goal**: Summarize the four stages of cognitive development according to Piaget's Theory.

**Two-Year-Old Rowen's Experience**

Rowen, a two-year-old child, asks her father about an object in the car while he is driving. Her father cannot respond due to focusing on the road. This situation highlights children's inability to understand other people's perspectives at this stage.

**Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development**

Jean Piaget, a developmental psychologist, studied how children's thinking changes as they grow. He discovered that children's minds work differently than adults'. According to Piaget, we develop schemas (ways of thinking) through accommodation and assimilation.

**Assimilation and Accommodation**

During **assimilation**, we fit new experiences into existing schemas. For example, a child might call a butterfly a bird because it flies. During **accommodation**, we modify or create new schemas to include new information that doesn't fit the existing schema. In our example, the child must accommodate by understanding that butterflies are not birds but have their own category.

**Four Stages of Cognitive Development**

Piaget identified four stages of cognitive development: Sensorimotor Stage, Preoperational Stage, Concrete Operational Stage, and Formal Operational Stage.


**Piaget's Four Stages of Cognitive Development**:

1. **Sensorimotor Stage (Birth to 2 Years)**: Infants acquire information through senses and motor exploration. They develop object permanence, the understanding that objects continue to exist even when hidden.
   * Acquire information primarily through senses and motor exploration
   * Develop first schemas based on actions performed on objects
   * Understand object permanence around 9 months
2. **Preoperational Stage (2 to 7 Years)**: Children begin to think symbolically but cannot think operationally. They use intuitive reasoning based on superficial appearances and exhibit egocentrism.
   * Begin to think about objects not in their immediate view
   * Think symbolically, can pretend
   * Cannot think logically about problems
   * View the world through their own experiences
3. **Concrete Operational Stage (7 to 12 Years)**: Children begin to understand logic and operations. They can reason logically about concrete problems and understand conservation laws.
   * Understand logic and operations
   * Reason logically about concrete problems
   * Understand conservation laws, such as the law of conservation of mass
4. **Formal Operational Stage (Adolescence and Beyond)**: Children can think abstractly and hypothetically. They can reason logically about abstract concepts and solve complex problems.
   * Think abstractly and hypothetically
   * Reason logically about abstract concepts
   * Solve complex problems using logical reasoning

**Modern Interpretations of Piaget's Theory**

Piaget's theory has been revised to consider:

* Cognitive development as trends rather than strict stages.
* Children demonstrating skills from different stages simultaneously.
* Social and cultural contexts shaping cognitive development.

**Theory of Mind**

The ability to understand that other people have mental states that influence their behavior is called theory of mind. Infants begin to develop this ability earlier than Piaget's theory predicts, around 9 months old. By the end of their second year, children become very good at reading intentions. The capacity for theory of mind sets the foundation for developing meaningful social relationships with others.

### 4.6 LANGUAGE DEVELOPS IN AN ORDERLY WAY

**Five Stages of Language Development**

Language development follows an orderly process from infancy to adulthood. Newborns are born ready to learn language and are influenced by the languages they hear during pregnancy.

1. **Infant Stage (0-6 months)**:
   - Babies distinguish all speech sounds of all languages.
   - Develop ability to speak through cooing, laughing, and babbling.
2. **Babbling Stage (3-8 months)**:
   - Intentional vocalization without specific meaning.
   - Babbling includes single consonants, vowels, syllables.
3. **One-Word Stage (8-18 months)**:
   - Toddlers combine phonemes into morphemes to label objects and actions.
   - Use words for various communicative functions.
4. **Two-Word Stage (18-24 months)**:
   - Rapid growth in vocabulary.
   - Form basic sentences with correct syntax.
5. **Overregularization Stage (3-5 years)**:
   - Children apply regular grammar rules incorrectly to irregular words.
   - Reflects recognition of patterns in spoken language.

Language development is a hierarchical structure, with sentences and phrases created from words, words from morphemes, and morphemes from phonemes.

### 4.7 ADOLESCENTS DEVELOP PHYSICALLY

**Adolescents' Physical Development during Puberty**

* Marks the beginning of adolescence with the onset of sexual maturity and ability to reproduce
* Characterized by an adolescent growth spurt, hormonal changes, and development of secondary and primary sex characteristics

**Puberty**

* A developmental period leading to sexual maturation
* First signs begin around age 8 for girls and 9-10 for boys
* **Completion varies**: girls by age 16, boys by age 18
* Rapid increase in height and weight
* Development of secondary sex characteristics (hair growth, muscle mass, voice deepening, breast development)
* Maturation of primary sex characteristics (menstruation, sperm production)
* Environmental factors can influence puberty onset

**Brain Development during Adolescence**

* Frontal lobes develop more slowly than limbic motivational regions
* Impulsive and risky behaviors due to underdeveloped frontal cortex
* Importance of guidance and discipline for decision-making skills development
* Ongoing studies, like the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, provide insights into adolescent brain development.

### 4.8 ADOLESCENTS DEVELOP SOCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY

* Adolescence is a period of significant socio-emotional development, focusing on self-identity and understanding one's place in the world.
* **Erikson's Theory of Psychosocial Development**:
	+ Recognizes the importance of the entire life span.
	+ Consists of eight stages, each with a major psychosocial crisis to be resolved for healthy development.
	+ Fifth stage is Identity versus Role Confusion (Adolescence).

**Identity Development**

* Adolescents seek to understand themselves and their place in the world.
* Influenced by various factors, including culture, family, and personal experiences.
* **Crisis of identity versus role confusion**:
	+ Adolescents explore different social roles and try out various identities.
	+ Globalization exposes adolescents to diverse worldviews and influences their identity formation.
	+ Ethnicity and race play significant roles in identity development.
	+ Families have a considerable impact on adolescent identity formation.

**Parental Influence and Parenting Styles**

* Conflict between adolescents and parents is common but can lead to important skills development.
* Erikson believed that negotiating a stable identity requires questioning and challenging parental and societal ideas.
* Parents have significant influence on their children's behaviors, values, and independence.
* **Four parenting styles based on responsiveness and demandingness**:
	+ Neglectful (unresponsive and low demand)
	+ Authoritarian (high demand and low responsiveness)
	+ Permissive (low demand and high responsiveness)
	+ Authoritative (high demand and high responsiveness)
* Research suggests that authoritative parenting produces the most favorable outcomes for children.

**Glossary**

* **Identity versus role confusion**: The fifth stage of Erikson's theory of psychosocial development, in which adolescents face the challenge of figuring out who they are.
* **Parenting styles**: Methods of parenting based on levels of how demanding and responsive a parent is.

### 4.9 WHAT ROLES DO PEERS PLAY IN DEVELOPMENT?
#### USING PSYCHOLOGY IN YOUR LIFE

**What Roles Do Peers Play in Development?**

- Peers play a significant role in identity development.
- Children spend much time interacting with peers, starting from infancy.
- Infants begin imitating other children and forming social signals (Brownell & Brown, 1992).
- Having good relations with peers is linked to positive psychological well-being and strong sense of identity (Ragelienė, 2016).

**Peer Interactions in Childhood**:

- Children form friendships based on shared interests and values during adolescence.
- Peer groups are crucial for belonging, social support, and acceptance.
- Bullying can have negative effects, including exclusion and anxiety (Espelage & Holt, 2012).

**Types of Bullying**:

- **Physical bullying**: physical contact or intimidation.
- **Verbal bullying**: name-calling, offensive remarks, verbal intimidation.
- **Social bullying**: spreading rumors, exclusion, making fun of differences.
- **Cyberbullying**: sending aggressive messages using technology.

**Impact of Bullying**:

- Bullies may lack moral emotions like guilt and shame (Hymel et al., 2005).
- Bullies show increased moral disengagement and positive attitudes towards bullying.
- Being bullied is linked to psychological disorders, such as anxiety and depression (Copeland et al., 2013).

**Preventing and Responding to Bullying**:

- **Stop the bullying on the spot**: intervene calmly, ensure safety, call for help if necessary.
- **Find out what happened**: gather information from witnesses, avoid jumping to conclusions or placing blame.
- **Support the kids involved**: assure victims it's not their fault, work towards resolution, help bullies understand their behavior is wrong.

### 4.10 ADOLESCENTS DEVELOP COGNITIVELY

**Moral Development in Adolescents** 

**Learning Goal**: Summarize the development of moral reasoning in adolescents.

Adolescents are expected to make good decisions based on societal rules despite their rebellious behavior. Moral choices impact others and the ability to decide between behaviors with competing social outcomes is crucial. Moral development encompasses both **moral reasoning** and **moral emotions**.

**Moral Reasoning**:
- Depends on cognitive processes
- Involves deciding when it's acceptable to harm others or break societal rules
- **Theorists divide morality into two factors**: moral reasoning and moral emotions

**Moral Emotions**:
- Linked to societal interests as a whole
- Motivate people to do good things and avoid bad ones
- Include shame, guilt, disgust, embarrassment, pride, and gratitude
- Children's developing sense of morality is influenced by emotional reactions

**Moral Reasoning Development**:
- Lawrence Kohlberg's stage theory focuses on cognitive processes
- Tests moral reasoning skills using hypothetical situations
- **Three main levels**: preconventional, conventional, and postconventional

**Preconventional Level**:
- Based on self-interest and event outcomes
- People solve moral dilemmas based on what they can get away with or fear of punishment

**Conventional Level**:
- Conforms to rules of law and order or focuses on others' approval/disapproval
- People's responses are influenced by societal expectations and the desire for social acceptance

**Postconventional Level**:
- Centers on complex reasoning, abstract principles, and the value of all life
- Decisions depend on the greater good for all people and giving less thought to personal wishes or fear of punishment

**Limitations of Kohlberg's Theory**:
- Applies only to American men
- Neglects moral emotions that influence moral judgments
- Not everyone progresses through stages at the same rate or in the same order

**Guiding Moral Development**:
- Showing consequences of behavior and promoting sympathetic attitudes, guilt, and awareness of others' feelings is effective in changing children's behavior
- Consistent with authoritative parenting styles

**Adult Development**:
- Important physical, socio-emotional, and cognitive changes occur throughout adulthood
- Adolescence marks the beginning of adulthood, lasting through old age and concluding with death.

### 4.11 EMERGING ADULTHOOD IS A NEW DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD

**Emerging Adulthood** is a new developmental period in the developed world for individuals between the ages of 18 and 25. This stage occurs after adolescence but before achieving stable adult patterns of relationships and work. During this time, young people continue to explore their identity and consider various paths to adulthood.

**Rationale for Emerging Adulthood**:
- Young adults are taking longer to achieve traditional markers of maturity such as marriage, starting careers, buying houses, and having children.
- Average age at first marriage has increased significantly in the United States for both women (from 20.8 in 1970 to 28.0 today) and men (from 23.2 in 1970 to 29.9 today).
- In 2018, only 29% of those aged 25-34 were married, which was half the rate in 1978.
- In addition, there has been a sharp reduction in many behaviors associated with becoming an adult, such as getting a driver's license, working for pay, dating, and having sex.

**Characteristics of Emerging Adulthood**:
- Young people are further developing their sense of identity during this period.
- There is greater freedom to consider multiple paths to adulthood due to less influence from parents.
- **Factors influencing the emergence of emerging adulthood include**:
  - Greater gender equity in Western cultures, providing more occupational and educational opportunities for women.
  - Most young people attend college or pursue advanced education.
  - Becoming financially independent is a challenge for emerging adults, who depend more on parental support than prior generations did.
- Arnett (2016) has shown that the concept of emerging adulthood applies across all social classes in the developed world.

**Benefits of Emerging Adulthood**:
- People have more time to find out what will be most meaningful to them, potentially leading to richer lives.
- Delaying marriage and parenting increases opportunities for additional education and maturation, which can improve the health and well-being of future children.

### 4.12 BODIES AND MINDS CHANGE IN ADULTHOOD

**Summary of Changes in Body and Cognition during Adulthood**:

* Humans have seen significant increases in life expectancy in the last century due to advancements in medicine, hygiene, and food availability. However, recent trends such as obesity and opioid epidemics may lead to shorter lifespans for current generations.

**Physical Changes**:

* Between ages 20 and 40, people experience a decline in muscle mass, bone density, eyesight, and hearing.
* A healthy lifestyle, including good nutrition and exercise in early adulthood, can help improve health throughout life and increase longevity.
* The number of older adults (over age 85) is growing rapidly, with many living beyond 100.
* The body and mind start deteriorating more rapidly after age 50, leading to changes such as graying hair, wrinkling skin, and shrinking frontal lobes in the brain.

**Cognitive Changes**:

* Cognitive abilities begin declining much earlier in life, with a consistent and identifiable cognitive change being a slowing of mental processing speed.
* Older adults take longer to learn new information but use it as efficiently as young adults once they have learned it.
* Older adults tend to have difficulty with memory tasks that require juggling multiple pieces of information at the same time, but continued learning and exercise can help offset these losses.
* Older adults who engage in regular aerobic exercise show an increase in hippocampus size and improvements in memory.
* Dementia, a major cause of dementia in older adults, affects approximately 11% of people over 65 and about 1 in 3 after age 85. Symptoms include memory impairments and personality changes.

**Brain Regions**:

* The frontal lobes of the brain shrink proportionally more than other regions as people age.

### 4.13 ADULTS DEVELOP LIFELONG SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL BONDS

* Summarize social and emotional processes during adult aging according to Erikson's psychosocial theory.

**Erikson's Psychosocial Stages**

According to Erikson, successful adult development includes:

1. Intimate relationships with friends and partners (intimacy vs isolation)
2. Making improvements for future generations (generativity vs stagnation)
3. A sense of honesty about oneself and a feeling that one has lived life well (integrity vs despair)

**Young Adulthood (Intimacy vs Isolation)**

* Forming and maintaining committed friendships and romantic relationships
* Building a strong sense of identity in adolescence is crucial for forming intimate relationships

**Emerging Adulthood (Generativity vs Stagnation)**

* Making improvements for future generations
* Caring for children, being productive in a career, having regard for others, and being concerned about the future
* Leaving a positive legacy

**Old Age (Integrity vs Despair)**

* Viewing one's life in a generally positive light despite ups and downs or tragedies
* Facing death with honesty and wisdom

**Marriage**

* Majority of people marry or form permanent bonds worldwide
* Marriage is beneficial for most couples, providing greater happiness, longer lifespan, and better health
* Same-sex marriage also provides significant benefits for mental and physical health
* Men benefit more from marriage than women due to wives' influence on their health behaviors and social support
* Unhappily married people are at risk for poor health and mortality

**Having Children**

* Birth of a first child is a profound event, providing meaning in life and moments of joy
* Both rewarding and challenging experience

**Socio-Emotional Development: Having Children and Aging**

**Having Children**:

* Provides opportunity for emotional bonding and joy (a)
* Can create conflict within a couple's relationship (b)
* Discussing roles and responsibilities before having a child can help (Shapiro et al., 2000)
* Mothers and fathers enjoy interacting with children, but gender inequity exists (McDonnell et al., 2019; Nelson-Coffey et al., 2019)
* Having children may involve a trade-off between happiness in the moment and leading a meaningful life (Deaton & Stone, 2014)

**Impact on Couples**:

* Consistently report less marital satisfaction than childless couples (Belsky, 1990; Cowan & Cowan, 1988; Hansen, 2012)
* Sleep deprivation and agitation during first months can strain relationship (Cowan & Cowan, 1988)
* Communication and understanding each other's needs important for success (Shapiro et al., 2000)

**Gender Inequity**:

* Fathers report more happiness than mothers during leisure time activities with children (Musick et al., 2016)
* Women generally devote more time to childcare and household tasks, even for single mothers (McDonnell et al., 2019; Yavorsky et al., 2015)

**Choosing to Have Children**:

* Deaton and Stone (2014) concluded that happiness is not determined by having or not having children
* Important to consider consequences before making decision

**Finding Meaning in Later Life**:

**Older Adults**:

* Perceive time as limited, prioritize emotionally meaningful events (Carstensen, 1995; Fung & Carstensen, 2004)
* Spend more time with close friends and family, reflect on lives (Charles et al., 2016)
* Report shorter and fewer negative emotional experiences (Charles et al., 2016)
* Want to savor final years with meaningful experiences (Figure 4.35)

**Factors for Older Adults' Satisfaction**:

* Maintain physical health, social ties, cognitive capacities throughout life

**Erikson's Theory of Psychosocial Development**:

* **Intimacy versus isolation**: young adults form committed relationships (sixth stage)
* **Generativity versus stagnation**: middle-aged adults leave a positive legacy and care for future generations (seventh stage)
* **Integrity versus despair**: older adults feel satisfied with their lives and develop wisdom (eighth stage)

## 5 SENSATION AND PERCEPTION

**Understanding the Connection between Seeing, Hearing, Tasting, Smelling, and Feeling**

**I. Introduction**
- Discussion on how people perceive and sense their world through various senses
- Introducing the concept of synesthesia and its impact on perception

**II. Sensation and Perception: An Overview**
1. The importance of understanding sensation and perception
2. **Four steps from sensation to perception**: Sensation, Transduction, Perception, Interpretation

**III. Sensation: Detection of Physical Stimuli**
1. Definition of sensation as the sense organs' detection of physical stimuli and transmission of information to the brain
2. **Description of the five primary senses**: sight (vision), sound (hearing), taste, smell, and touch or feel
3. **Examples of sensory input**: light waves, sound waves, food molecules, odor molecules, temperature changes, pressure changes on the skin

**IV. Perception: Processing, Organization, and** Interpretation of Sensory Information
1. Definition of perception as the processing, organization, and interpretation of sensory information in the brain
2. The role of interpreting sensation in perception
3. Description of how objects do not have inherent colors; our visual systems interpret light waves as different colors
4. Explanation of transduction, the process by which sensory receptors change physical stimuli into neural signals
5. Discussion on how the brain processes action potentials and interprets them as meaningful information

**V. Synesthesia: A Unique Perceptual Experience**
1. Definition of synesthesia as a condition where one form of sensory input triggers an additional experience in another form
2. **Examples of synesthetic experiences**: taste-color, number-color, and other cross-modal associations

**VI. Conclusion**
1. Recap of the importance of understanding sensation and perception
2. Emphasis on the interconnectedness of all senses in creating our experience of the world
3. Encouragement to explore further the unique ways our brains process sensory information.

### 5.2 THERE MUST BE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF A STIMULUS FOR YOU TO DETECT IT

* **Absolute Threshold**: The minimum amount of physical stimuli required for a person to detect sensory input half of the time it is present.
* **Difference Threshold**: The smallest difference in physical stimulus required to notice a change between two sensory inputs.

**Why Can We Only Detect Some Stimuli?**

* Our sense organs are exposed to an enormous amount of physical stimulation from the environment, but we do not notice most of it.
* Physical stimuli must exceed a certain level before we experience a sensation.

**Absolute Threshold**:

* Minimum amount of sensory input required for detection (Figure 5.3)
* Quietest whisper you could hear half the time
* Table 5.1 lists approximate minimum amounts of physical stimuli for each sense

**Difference Threshold**:

* Smallest change in physical stimulus required to detect a difference between two sensory experiences
* Minimum volume change required to notice a commercial on TV
* **Weber's Law**: The just-noticeable difference between two sensory inputs is based on a proportion of the original input rather than a fixed amount

**Sensory Adaptation**:

* Our sensory systems become less sensitive to processing a constant level of input over time
* Takes place at the level of sensory receptors, which fire less often when stimuli do not change
* **Example**: No longer noticing the smell of spices after working at a Thai restaurant for hours (Figure 5.4)
* Temporary adaptation

### 5.3 SENSORY RECEPTORS IN YOUR EYES DETECT LIGHT

**Visual Sensation and Perception: The Four Steps**

1. **Focusing Light in the Eye**:

* Light enters the eye through the cornea, the transparent outer layer.
* Passes through the pupil, a small opening controlled by the iris.
* Iris determines how much light enters the eye based on lighting conditions and personal preference.
* Muscles adjust the shape of the lens to focus light on the retina.
* Cornea and lens work together to accurately focus light.
* Glasses and contact lenses help correct vision by assisting the lens in bending light.
* Presbyopia is a condition where the muscles of the lens lose their ability to change shape, making it difficult to focus on close objects.

2. **Rods and Cones**:

* Light is focused on the retina, the inner surface of the back of the eyeball.
* Retina contains rods and cones, sensory receptors that detect light waves.
* Rods are responsible for night vision and do not support color vision or fine detail.
* Cones are responsible for daytime vision, color vision, and fine detail.
* Fovea is a small region in the center of the retina where cones are densely packed.
* **Blind spot**: area at the retina where there are no rods or cones, resulting in a blind area in the visual field.

3. **From Eye to Brain**:

* Rods and cones transduce light waves into signals that are processed in the brain as vision.
* Information is delivered to ganglion cells, the first true neurons in the visual system.
* Axons of ganglion cells form the optic nerve, which exits the eye at the back of the retina.
* **Blind spots**: areas where the optic nerve leaves the eye and there are no rods or cones.
* Half of the axons in the optic nerves cross to the other side of the brain at the optic chiasm.
* Visual information is sent to the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobes for basic processing.

4. **Learning Goal Check**:

* Spotting a friend is more difficult at night because rods, which are responsible for night vision and do not support color vision or fine detail, are activated instead of cones.

### 5.4 YOU PERCEIVE COLOR BASED ON PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF LIGHT
 
**Color Perception**

* **Two factors determine how we perceive color**: the wavelengths of light an object reflects and how our eyes process the light.
* Humans can identify millions of different shades of color due to these factors.

**Physical Experience of Color**

* Visible light consists of electromagnetic waves ranging from about 400 to 700 nanometers (nm).
* **Physical qualities of light include amplitude and wavelength**:
	+ Amplitude: height of the wave, experienced as brightness.
	+ Wavelength: distance from peak to peak, experienced as hue.

**Trichromatic Theory**

* Color perception results from activity across three types of cone receptors (S, M, and L cones).
* **Each type of receptor is sensitive to different wavelengths**:
	+ S cones: short wavelengths, responsible for blue perception.
	+ M cones: medium wavelengths, responsible for green perception.
	+ L cones: long wavelengths, responsible for red perception.
* Trichromatic theory explains color blindness, which is partial blindness for certain colors.
* Two main types of color blindness are red-green and blue-yellow.

**Opponent-Process Theory**

* Some aspects of color vision cannot be explained by cone receptors alone.
* Opponent-process theory explains perceptual experiences like afterimages and color opposites.
* Ganglion cells receive excitatory input from one type of cone and inhibitory input from another, creating the perception that some colors are opposites.

**Afterimages**

* Afterimages occur when we stare at a color for an extended period and then look away.
* Red, green, blue, and yellow afterimages can be explained by opponent-process theory.

### 5.5 YOU PERCEIVE OBJECTS BY ORGANIZING VISUAL INFORMATION

**Object Perception: Three Principles**

**Learning Goal**: Summarize the three principles of object perception based on the text.

The text discusses the principles of object perception, focusing on the Gestalt approach to psychology and its explanation of how our brains group perceived features into an organized whole. The following are the key concepts and principles:

1. **Perception is more than just gathering sensory input**
- Our brains use a number of built-in principles to organize sensory information.
- Objects exist as units, not as collections of separate features.

2. **Grouping: Forming a coherent image of what you are seeing**
- The visual system seeks to form a unified image of what is being seen.
- Gestalt psychologists identified several principles that explain how visual grouping works:
  * **Proximity**: Visual elements are clustered based on their proximity to each other.
  * **Similarity**: Visual elements are grouped if they look alike.
  * **Continuity of a line**: Our brains perceive lines as continuous, even when they are incomplete or disconnected.
  * **Closure of gaps**: Our brains fill in missing information to complete the perception of an object.
  * **Creation of illusory contours**: Our brains can create the perception of edges and shapes based on contextual cues.

3. **Bottom-up and top-down processing**
- Perception occurs through both bottom-up and top-down processing.
- Bottom-up processing is based on the physical features of the stimulus.
- Top-down processing involves using prior experiences, expectations, and knowledge to interpret sensory information.
- Context and expectation play important roles in perception and can influence our perceptual set, leading to biased or faulty perceptions.

### 5.6 WHEN YOU PERCEIVE DEPTH, YOU CAN LOCATE OBJECTS IN SPACE

**Cognitive Development and Perception of Depth**

* Look up and reach for an object to understand the importance of spatial ability and depth perception
* **Two types of cues for perceiving depth**: binocular and monocular

**Binocular Depth Perception**

* Objects appear three-dimensional, but retinas process depth information in two dimensions
* **Binocular disparity**: difference in location of an object as seen by left and right eyes
* Brain uses disparity to compute distances and perceive depth
* 3D movies use binocular disparity for depth perception through polarized lenses

**Monocular Depth Perception**

* Flat images can create the illusion of depth with monocular cues or pictorial depth cues
* Artists use monocular cues to create a sense of depth in their work
* **Examples of monocular depth cues**: occlusion, height in field, relative size, familiar size, linear perspective, texture gradient

### 5.7 CUES IN YOUR BRAIN AND IN THE WORLD LET YOU PERCEIVE MOTION

**Perception of Motion**

* We perceive motion by sensing changes in illumination on our retinas.
* Changes in illumination, combined with object recognition processes, enable us to identify objects moving and changing locations.

**Two Phenomena Illustrating Perception of Motion**

**Motion Aftereffects**

* Occurs when we gaze at a moving image for an extended period and then look at a stationary scene.
* We experience a momentary impression that the new scene is moving in the opposite direction due to fatigued motion detectors in the visual cortex.
* Evidence of motion-sensitive neurons in the brain.

**Stroboscopic Motion**

* Illusion of motion created by presenting slightly different images in rapid succession.
* Our brains perceive a series of still images as moving, creating the illusion of motion pictures.
* Used extensively in movies for special effects, camera work, and fast editing.

**Learning Goal Check**:

If you and your friend are watching holiday lights on a house blink one after another, creating the appearance of continuous movement, explain to your friend that:

* Our perception of motion comes from sensing changes in illumination on our retinas.
* The blinking lights create an illusion of continuous motion due to the rapid succession of light changes.
* Our brains perceive these changes as motion by interpreting the differences between each image, a phenomenon known as stroboscopic motion.

### 5.8 YOU UNDERSTAND THAT OBJECTS REMAIN CONSTANT EVEN WHEN CUES CHANGE

**Key Concept**: Object constancy is the ability to perceive objects as remaining constant in their size, shape, color, and brightness across different viewing conditions. This perception helps maintain a stable understanding of the world.

**Types of Constancy**:

1. **Size Constancy**: Understanding the relationship between an object's actual size and its perceived size based on its distance from the observer.
2. **Shape Constancy**: Recognizing that an object's shape remains constant despite changes in viewing angle or perspective.
3. **Color Constancy**: Perceiving an object's color as consistent, even when illumination conditions change.
4. **Brightness Constancy**: Maintaining a stable perception of an object's brightness level despite variations in lighting conditions.

**Explanation**:

As we interact with our environment, the sensory information we receive is affected by various cues such as distance, angle, and illumination. Object constancy helps us correctly perceive objects despite these changing conditions. To maintain each type of constancy:

1. **Size Constancy**: Knowing how far away an object is from you allows you to maintain its perceived size.
2. **Shape Constancy**: Understanding the angles from which you are viewing an object enables you to perceive its shape consistently.
3. **Brightness Constancy**: Comparing the amount of light reflected from an object and its background helps maintain a stable perception of brightness.
4. **Color Constancy**: Comparing the wavelengths of light reflected from an object with those reflected from its background allows for consistent color perception.

**Object Constancy and Perceptual Illusions**: Object constancy allows us to see a stable world while also experiencing perceptual illusions that we cannot control. The brain has built-in assumptions that influence our perceptions, which can sometimes result in illusions.

**Hearing**: Hearing, or audition, is another essential source of information about the world. Sound waves are transduced in the auditory system and then perceived in the brain. Understanding how sound is processed helps us navigate our environment and communicate effectively.

### 5.9 RECEPTORS IN YOUR EARS DETECT SOUND WAVES

**Auditory Sensation and Perception: Four Steps from Ear to Brain**

1. **Reception of Sound Waves**
- Sound waves are sensory input for hearing.
- They reach the outer ear, a shell-shaped structure that increases the ear's ability to capture sound waves.
- The vibrations travel down the auditory canal to the eardrum.

2. **Transduction of Auditory Information in the Inner Ear**
- Vibrations of the eardrum are transferred to the ossicles (hammer, anvil, and stirrup), which amplify the vibrations.
- The amplified vibrations reach the oval window, causing it to vibrate.
- The oval window's vibrations create pressure waves in the fluid of the cochlea, making the basilar membrane move in a wave.
- Movement of the basilar membrane stimulates bending of hair cells, which are sensory receptors for auditory input.
- Bending of hair cells causes transduction of auditory information into signals (action potentials) in the auditory nerve.

3. **Transmission of Auditory Information to the Brain**
- The auditory nerve sends the signals to the thalamus and then to the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe.

4. **Perception of Sound**
- The primary auditory cortex processes the information, resulting in the perception of sound coming from a specific source (e.g., saxophone).

### 5.10 HOW CAN YOU AVOID DAMAGE TO YOUR HEARING FROM LISTENING TO LOUD MUSIC WITH EARBUDS?
#### USING PSYCHOLOGY IN YOUR LIFE 

**Learning Goal**: Explain how loud sounds damage hearing and ways to prevent it.

**Damaging Effects of Loud Music on Hearing**:

- Permanent hearing damage can occur from listening to music at maximum volume through headphones or earbuds, especially over extended periods.
- Young people are particularly susceptible, with nearly 13% of American children between ages 6 and 19 experiencing noise-induced hearing loss (CDC, 2013).
- Loud sounds produce sound waves with higher amplitudes that stimulate hair receptors in the basilar membrane more than soft sounds.
- Repeated overstimulation of hair cells in the cochlea can lead to a loss of ability to transduce sound waves.
- Hearing loss can be caused by both volume (decibels) and length of exposure.

**Table 5.2: Noises in the Environment and Hearing Damage**

| Noise in the Environment | Loudness in Decibels (approximate) | Listening Time Until Damage to Hair Cells (approximate) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Whisper | 30 | Safe for any length of time |
| Normal conversation | 60 | Safe for any length of time |
| Dishwasher | 70 | 8 hours |
| Vehicle traffic | 85 | 8 hours |
| Earbuds or headphones to listen to music on smartphone or other electronic device | 110 | 5 minutes |
| Average rock concert | 95-115 | 2 minutes |
| Sirens | 110-129 | Less than 1 minute |
| Jet engine | 140 | Immediate damage without hearing protection |
| Gunshot | 165 | Immediate damage without hearing protection |
| Rocket launch | 180 | Immediate damage without hearing protection |

**Preventing Hearing Damage**:

- Use the 60/60 rule: listen to music through headphones or earbuds for a maximum of 60 minutes at 60% of the maximum volume.
- After 60 minutes, give your ears a break for a while.
- Walk away from loud noise: stay as far away from the source of loud sound as possible.
- Use hearing protection, such as earplugs or earmuffs, if you cannot avoid loud sounds.
- Ringing ears are a warning sign: if your ears are ringing, buzzing, or roaring, or sounds seem muffled or distorted 24 hours after exposure to loud noise, have your hearing checked by a doctor.

**Applying the 60/60 Rule**:

If you're standing next to a friend listening to music through earbuds and can hear the song they're playing, explain that following the 60/60 rule could help protect against hearing damage:

- They should limit their listening time to 60 minutes.
- They should listen at no more than 60% of the maximum volume.
- After 60 minutes, they should give their ears a break for a while before listening again.

### 5.11 YOU PERCEIVE SOUND BASED ON PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF SOUND WAVES

The ability to distinguish between different pitches in sounds is a crucial aspect of our auditory perception system. In this text, we discuss the mechanisms of temporal coding and place coding that enable us to perceive pitch.

**Learning Goal**: Explain the roles of temporal coding and place coding in pitch perception.

**Sound Waves**:
A sound wave consists of changes in air pressure over time. The height of the waves is called amplitude, which determines loudness, while the wavelength and frequency (the time between peaks) determine pitch. Most humans can detect sounds with frequencies ranging from about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, although our ability to hear high-frequency sounds decreases rapidly in adulthood.

**Temporal Coding**:
For encoding relatively low frequencies (up to approximately 4,000 Hz), the auditory system uses temporal coding. This process involves matching the frequency of sound waves with the timing of firing of the auditory nerve. For example, when you hear a tuba playing a 40-Hz tone, the basilar membrane vibrates at 40 times per second, causing hair cells to send impulses to the auditory nerve at the same rate.

**Place Coding**:
At higher frequencies (above approximately 4,000 Hz), temporal coding can be maintained only if hair cells fire in volleys. Additionally, place coding is used for encoding different frequencies by hair cells in different locations on the basilar membrane. For instance, a piccolo producing a high-frequency sound of 4,000 Hz causes the basilar membrane to move at its base, stimulating hair cells in that location.

**Processing Pitch**:
After the hair cells and auditory nerve have fired based on the frequency of a sound wave, processing in the brain allows us to perceive pitch. This processing takes place in the primary auditory cortex, where neurons code the frequency of auditory stimuli. The neurons toward the rear of the auditory cortex respond best to high-frequency sounds, while those toward the front respond best to low-frequency sounds.

**Localization**:
Our ability to locate the origin of a sound is called localization. While hair cells cannot code where events occur, our brain integrates the different sensory information coming from each ear to determine the direction of a sound. This process involves comparing the time when the sound arrives in each ear and the intensity (amplitude) of the sound wave in each ear.

**Vestibular Sense**:
Unlike other senses, which detect external stimuli, the vestibular sense is an internal sensory system that helps maintain balance. It uses structures in the inner ear called semicircular canals, which contain a liquid that moves when the head moves, bending hair cells in the canals and generating signals that inform us of our head's rotation.

**Related Concept**:
- **Flavor Perception**: Our perception of flavor is based on both taste and smell. When our sense of smell is impaired (e.g., due to a cold), food may seem tasteless.

### 5.12 RECEPTORS IN YOUR TASTE BUDS DETECT CHEMICAL MOLECULES

**Taste Sensation and Perception: The Four Steps**

1. **From the Mouth to the Brain**:
   - Physical stimulus from food consists of chemical molecules in the food that dissolve in saliva.
   - Taste receptors in taste buds detect the chemical molecules.
   - Taste information is sent to other brain regions through a set of nerves, primarily the facial nerve.
   - After processing by the thalamus, the information is further processed in the primary gustatory cortex.

2. **Five Main Tastes**:
   - Sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami (savory or yummy).
   - Umami is the most recently recognized taste sensation.
   - Perception of all five tastes arises from the activation of unique combinations of receptors in taste buds.

**Taste Preferences**:

- Individual taste preferences come partly from different numbers of taste receptors.
- The texture, visual presentation, and discomfort caused by food also affect taste preferences.

**Infant Taste Preferences Affected by Mother's Diet Hypothesis**:

- Babies become familiar with the taste of foods their mothers consume around the time of their birth.
- They prefer familiar tastes due to prenatal and postnatal flavor learning.

### 5.13 YOUR OLFACTORY RECEPTORS DETECT ODORANTS

**Olfactory Sensation and Perception: The Four Steps**

1. **Smell Reception**: Olfaction, or the sense of smell, is a primary way animals, including dogs, perceive their environment. Humans have a less developed sense of smell compared to many animals due to our ancestors' reliance on vision. However, we still spend significant resources on fragrances, deodorants, and mouthwash.
   * Dogs have 40 times more olfactory receptors than humans and are 100,000 to 1 million times more sensitive to odors.
   * Our less developed sense of smell is due to our evolutionary history.

2. **Application of Understanding Sensation and Perception in the Workplace**:
   a. **Restaurant Industry**: The presentation of food plays a crucial role in customers' perception and enjoyment of their dining experience. Attractive plating, sizzling sounds, and background music can all influence people's desire for specific dishes.
      * Michel et al. (2014) and Zellner et al. (2011) found that food presentation affects taste perception.
      * Beckerman & Gray (2014) discovered that the sound of sizzling fajitas increases sales.
      * Spence (2012) showed that background music can influence people's perception of food.
   b. **Food Product Development**: Understanding sensation and perception is essential for developing new food products. Food scientists work to find the ideal combination of tastes, known as the "bliss point," which encourages continued consumption.
      * Companies such as Pillsbury, General Mills, and Schweppes employ food scientists to develop appealing food products.
      * The perfect level of sugar, salt, or fat is crucial for consumer appeal.
   c. **Other Forms of Sensation and Perception**: Understanding sensation and perception is vital in various fields such as advertising, marketing, architecture, engineering, design, and the fine arts. Knowledge of visual perception, hearing, touch, and pain processing can lead to successful careers.
3. **Olfactory System**: From Nose to Brain**
   a. **Smell Reception**: The olfactory system begins when chemical molecules called odorants pass into the nose and through the upper and back portions of the nasal cavity. In the nose, a warm, moist environment helps the sensory receptors, called olfactory receptors, detect odorant molecules.
      * Olfactory receptors are embedded within the olfactory epithelium, a thin layer of tissue located deep in the nasal cavity.
      * Each type of odorant stimulates several types of receptors, and the pattern of activity across these receptors determines the resulting smell
   b. **Signal Transmission**: The olfactory nerve transmits smell information from the olfactory bulb to various brain regions, including the primary olfactory cortex. Unlike all other forms of sensory information, smell signals bypass the thalamus.
4. **Smell Perception**
   a. **Processing Pleasantness and Intensity**: Information about whether a smell is pleasant or unpleasant is processed in the brain's prefrontal cortex. The intensity of a smell is processed in the amygdala, a brain area involved in emotion and memory.  
      * Smell perception can evoke feelings and memories.
   b. **Identifying Odors**: Humans can discriminate among thousands of different odors but are not very good at identifying odors by name. Women are generally better than men at identifying odors due to having more cells in the olfactory bulb.
5. **Touch and Pain**
   a. **Sense of Touch**: The sense of touch is unique because receptors exist all over the body, making it our largest organ for sensory reception. Touches can feel good due to the extensive coverage of receptors on the skin.
      * Our skin is our largest organ for sensory reception.
   b. **Feeling Touch and Pain**: The sense of touch includes both pleasant and painful sensations. Pain perception is crucial for protecting the body from harm.

**Glossary**

* **olfactory epithelium**: A thin layer of tissue, deep within the nasal cavity, containing the olfactory receptors; these sensory receptors produce information that is processed in the brain as smell.
* **olfactory bulb**: A brain structure above the olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity; from this structure, the olfactory nerve carries information about smell to the brain.

### 5.14 RECEPTORS IN YOUR SKIN DETECT TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE

**Touch Sensation and Perception**

* **Four steps in touch sensation and perception**:
	+ **Step 1**: Tactile stimulation (Figure 5.30)
		- Contact with skin produces experience of touch
	+ **Step 2**: Specialized receptors in the skin detect temperature and pressure (Figure 5.30)
		- Warm receptors: detect warmth
		- Cold receptors: detect coldness
		- Five types of pressure receptors:
			* **Nerve fibers at base of hair follicles**: respond to movement of hair
			* **Capsules in the skin**: respond to continued vibration, light fast pressure, light slow pressure, or stretching and steady pressure
	+ **Step 3**: Transduction of information into signals sent to the brain (Figure 5.30)
	+ **Step 4**: Sending touch information to the brain
		- Above neck: directly through cranial nerves
		- Below neck: through spinal cord and spinal nerves, then thalamus, and primary somatosensory cortex

**Perception of Touch**

* Knowing where on the body is being touched
	+ Discovered by Wilder Penfield in the 1940s (Penfield & Jasper, 1954)
	+ Parts of the body located near each other are processed in adjacent brain areas in the somatosensory cortex
	+ More cortex is dedicated to processing touch for sensitive regions like lips and fingers
	+ Less cortex is dedicated to processing touch for less sensitive regions like back and calves
* Kinesthetic sense (Figure 5.31)
	+ Internal sense of body position in space
	+ Related to touch
	+ Information comes from receptors inside muscles, tendons, and joints
	+ Coordinates voluntary movement and avoids injury
	+ Experienced daily: pinpointing position in space, registering movements of body and limbs

**Glossary**

* **Warm receptors**: sensory receptors in the skin that detect temperature and transduce it into information processed in the brain as warmth.
* **Cold receptors**: sensory receptors in the skin that detect temperature and transduce it into information processed in the brain as cold.
* **Pressure receptors**: sensory receptors in the skin that detect tactile stimulation and transduce it into information processed in the brain as different types of pressure on the skin.

### 5.15 YOU DETECT PAIN IN YOUR SKIN AND THROUGHOUT YOUR BODY

**Pain Perception**:

- Pain is a warning system that prevents harm to the body (Melzack & Wall, 1982).
- People with insensitivity to pain due to genetic disorders usually die young.
- Chronic pain, such as lower back pain, interferes with daily activities (Vlaeyen & Crombez, 2020).
- Itch is a related unpleasant touch perception that involves the same receptors as pain (Lay & Dong, 2020).

**Two Types of Pain Receptors**:

- Most experiences of pain result from damage to skin or other body tissues triggering pain receptors.
- Two types of nerve fibers carry pain information to the brain: fast and slow fibers.
- Fast fibers have myelinated axons, which carry sharp, immediate pains.
- Slow fibers have non-myelinated axons, which carry chronic, dull, steady pains.

**Gate Control Theory**:

- Pain is a complex experience influenced by biological, psychological, and cultural factors.
- Ronald Melzack and Patrick Wall formulated the gate control theory of pain (Melzack & Wall, 1982).
- According to this theory, we experience pain when pain receptors are activated and signals reach the brain through an open neural "gate" in the spinal cord.
- Sensory nerve fibers can "close a gate" by firing, reducing the perception of pain.

**Controlling Pain**:

- Pain perception can be influenced by factors such as wakefulness, distractions, and pain medication.
- Over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen or acetaminophen reduce pain perception.
- Severe pain is a warning sign that requires medical attention.
- Distraction techniques, such as watching an entertaining movie or listening to music, can help reduce pain perception (Engwall & Duppils, 2009).

## 6 LEARNING

**6.1 Learning from Experience**

* **Learning**: A change in behavior resulting from experience (Watson, 1924).
* **Behaviorism**: A school of thought emphasizing the role of environmental forces in producing behavior (Watson, 1924).
* **Tabula Rasa**: An infant is born as a blank slate, acquiring all knowledge through sensory experiences.
* Learning is crucial for survival and success in various aspects of life.
* Formal theories about learning emerged in the early 20th century to focus on observable stimuli and their effects on behavior.

**6.1.1 Classical Conditioning**

* **Pavlov's discovery**: Dogs salivate at the sound of a bell (unconditioned stimulus) when presented with food (unconditioned response).
* After repeated pairings, dogs learn to associate the bell (conditioned stimulus) with food and salivate (conditioned response) upon hearing it.
* Classical conditioning occurs through association between a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus.

**6.1.2 Operant Conditioning**

* **Skinner's discovery**: Rats press a lever to receive food pellets (reinforcer).
* **Behavior is modified based on its consequences**: Reinforcement strengthens behavior, while punishment weakens it.
* Operant conditioning occurs through the effects of consequences on behavior.

**6.1.3 Observational Learning**

* **Albert Bandura's research**: Children learn aggressive behaviors by observing adults and peers.
* Observational learning occurs through watching others and imitating their actions.

**Why We Watch Horror Movies**

* Horror movies use cues (music, shadows) to signal scary scenes, conditioning viewers to anticipate fear.
* The experience of being scared in a safe environment is enjoyable for many people.

### 6.2 YOU LEARN IN THREE WAYS

**Types of Learning**

- *Prenatal development*
  - non-associative learning
  - associative learning
  - learning by watching others.

**Non-Associative Learning**

- A person learns about a stimulus in the external world without any association with other stimuli or responses.
- Two forms: habituation and sensitization.

- **Habituation**
  - A person's behavioral response to a stimulus decreases after prolonged exposure or repetition.
  - Occurs when the stimulus is neither harmful nor rewarding.
  - Example: ignoring background noises after prolonged exposure.
- **Sensitization**
  - A person's behavioral response to a stimulus increases after prolonged exposure or repetition.
  - Occurs in response to potentially harmful or rewarding stimuli.
  - Example: increased awareness of coughing and sneezing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Associative Learning**

- A person learns how two or more pieces of information are related.

- **Classical Conditioning**
  - A person learns that one stimulus predicts another.
  - Example: learning to feel anxious when hearing certain music in a movie.
- **Operant Conditioning**
  - A person learns that a behavior leads to a particular outcome.
  - Example: studying leads to better grades.

**Learning by Watching Others**

- A person learns by observing others and imitating their behaviors or learning from their consequences.
- Three forms: observational learning, modeling, and vicarious conditioning.

- **Observational Learning**
  - A person learns a behavior after watching someone else engage in it.
  - Example: learning to bake bread by watching your mother.
- **Modeling**
  - A person imitates a behavior they have observed in others.
  - Example: learning the latest popular dance from a YouTube video.
- **Vicarious Conditioning**
  - A person learns to engage in, or avoid, a behavior based on observing others being rewarded or punished for performing that action.
  - Example: learning not to stay out late after seeing a sibling being punished for that behavior.

**Classification of Scenarios**

1. **Observational Learning (Learning by Watching Others)** - Cecilia learned how to make pasta sauce by watching her grandfather.
2. **Operant Conditioning** - Akira studied and took notes to avoid failing quizzes.
3. **Habituation** - Dante no longer notices the vanilla smell in his apartment because he has habituated to it.

### 6.3 THROUGH CLASSICAL CONDITIONING, YOU LEARN THAT STIMULI ARE RELATED

**Classical Conditioning** is a type of associative learning where a neutral object comes to elicit a response when it is associated with a stimulus that already produces a response. Ivan Pavlov, a Russian physiologist, conducted groundbreaking research on classical conditioning in 1904, for which he won the Nobel Prize. He studied the salivary reflex in dogs and discovered that they would salivate before actually tasting their food due to associating the sight of the food or the presence of a lab technician with the food.

**Four Steps in Classical Conditioning**:

1. **Unconditioned Stimulus (US)**: A stimulus that naturally elicits a response without any learning. In Pavlov's experiments, food was the unconditioned stimulus as it caused salivation in dogs.
2. **Neutral Stimulus (NS)**: A stimulus that does not produce a response on its own but can become conditioned to elicit a response when paired with an unconditioned stimulus. Pavlov used a metronome as the neutral stimulus.
3. **Conditioning Trials**: The neutral stimulus is presented along with the unconditioned stimulus during this phase, allowing the animal to associate the two. In Pavlov's study, the clicking sound of the metronome was presented just before food delivery.
4. **Critical Trials (or Conditioning)**: During critical trials, the neutral stimulus is presented alone without the unconditioned stimulus. If the animal responds to the neutral stimulus, it indicates that learning has taken place. In Pavlov's study, the dog salivated at the sound of the metronome alone, indicating conditioning.

**Conditioned Stimulus (CS)**: The neutral stimulus after it has been associated with an unconditioned stimulus and elicits a response. In Pavlov's study, the clicking sound of the metronome became the conditioned stimulus.

**Conditioned Response (CR)**: A response that is elicited by the conditioned stimulus after learning has taken place. In Pavlov's study, the salivation in response to the metronome sound was the conditioned response.

Classical conditioning plays a significant role in our daily lives, as we learn associations between various stimuli and responses. For example, the smell of french fries might make your mouth water because you have learned that the smell is associated with eating the fries. 

### 6.4 LEARNING VARIES IN CLASSICAL CONDITIONING

* Pavlov believed animals adapt to environments through conditioning, forming associations between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli to predict pleasure or pain.

**Acquisition**

* Gradual formation of a learned association between a CS (conditioned stimulus) and US (unconditioned stimulus) to produce CR (conditioned response).
* Occurs when the two stimuli are presented at the same time, but strongest when CS precedes US.
* Important that CS predicts US for conditioning to occur.

**Extinction**

* Weakening of the conditioned response when the CS no longer predicts the arrival of the US.
* Learning that the original association is no longer true.
* Does not completely eliminate the associative bond.

**Spontaneous Recovery**

* Reappearance of a weaker CR after a long time following extinction.
* Occurs when CS is presented again, but response fades quickly if US is not presented.

**Stimulus Generalization and Stimulus Discrimination**

* **Stimulus generalization**: responding to stimuli similar, but not identical, to the CS.
* Adaptive as animals seldom experience the CS in an identical way.
* **Stimulus discrimination**: learning to differentiate between two similar stimuli when only one is consistently associated with the US.
* Important for animals to distinguish between similar stimuli.

### 6.5 YOU CAN LEARN FEAR RESPONSES THROUGH CLASSICAL CONDITIONING

**Classical Conditioning and Phobias**:

* Phobias result from classical conditioning, which is the learning of a new response to a stimulus through association with another stimulus
* A phobia is an extreme fear reaction that can interfere with daily functioning
* Common phobias include fears of heights, enclosed places, insects, snakes, or the dark, and less common is coulrophobia (fear of clowns)
* Phobias can develop through generalization of a fear experience, as when a person stung by a wasp develops a fear of all flying insects
* Classical conditioning was first demonstrated in the case of "Little Albert" by John Watson in 1919
* In this study, Little Albert was conditioned to fear a white rat through pairing it with a loud sound
* The fear response generalized to other stimuli presented along with the rat

**Ethical Concerns**:

* Watson's study on Little Albert has been criticized as unethical and would not be approved by an ethics committee today
* Mary Cover Jones, a colleague of Watson's, used successful counterconditioning techniques to reduce phobias in children

**Counterconditioning**:

* Counterconditioning is a technique used to reduce or eliminate a fear response through pairing the feared stimulus with a pleasant stimulus
* This technique can help the person learn a new response to the feared stimulus, replacing the fear response
* For example, when a person has a phobia of spiders, a clinician might expose the client to spiders while having the client engage in an enjoyable task, such as eating ice cream (counterconditioning using favorite food)

**Learning Goal Check**:

To reduce your daughter's fear of dogs through counterconditioning that uses her favorite food (ice cream), follow these steps:

1. Identify a safe and controlled environment where your daughter can interact with a dog under supervision
2. Introduce the dog to your daughter while she is eating her favorite food, such as ice cream
3. Repeat this process multiple times, gradually increasing the distance between your daughter and the dog while continuing to offer her the favorite food
4. Over time, your daughter may learn to associate the presence of a dog with the pleasant experience of eating her favorite food, reducing her fear response to the dog.

### 6.6 ADAPTATION AND COGNITION INFLUENCE CLASSICAL CONDITIONING

**Pavlov's Theory**:
- Pavlov believed that any two events presented together would produce a learned association (classical conditioning).
- Any object or phenomenon could be converted to a conditioned stimulus when associated with an unconditioned stimulus.

**Adaptive Influences**:
* **Conditioned Taste Aversion**:
  - Certain pairings of stimuli are more likely to become associated than others.
  - Learning takes place even if the conditioned response occurs hours after the presentation of the unconditioned stimulus.
  - New foods are especially likely to produce learned aversions.
  - Adaptive responses help animals avoid potentially harmful stimuli.
* **Examples**:
  - Conditioned taste aversion in humans and animals.
  - Reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone National Park using conditioned taste aversion.
* **Smell and Taste vs. Light or Sound**:
  - Smell and taste are the main cues that guide our eating behavior, making it easier to produce conditioned taste aversions.
  - It is difficult to produce conditioned responses with light or sound.

**Cognitive Influences**:
* **Predictive Learning**:
  - Classical conditioning helps us predict the occurrence of events.
  - Dark clouds are better predictors of rain than umbrellas.
* **Role of Cognition in Learning**:
  - Robert Rescorla's studies highlighted the role of cognition in learning.
  - The conditioned stimulus must accurately predict the unconditioned stimulus for learning to take place.
* **Cognitive Model of Classical Learning**:
  - The strength of the CS-US association is determined by how unexpected or surprising the US is.
  - When we encounter an unexpected US, we try to understand how it happened and learn from it.

**Manual Can Opener Example**:
- In this example, the manual can opener goes from being a neutral stimulus to a new conditioned stimulus because it predicts the appearance of food (US).
- The cognitive model of learning emphasizes the role of prediction and expectation in learning.

### 6.7 THROUGH OPERANT CONDITIONING, YOU LEARN THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR ACTIONS

**Operant Conditioning** is a type of associative learning where the relationships between a behavior and its consequences determine how likely the behavior is to be performed in the future (Figure 6.2, p.223). In operant conditioning, an **operant** is an action that is performed on an environment and has consequences, while a **reinforcer** is a consequence of an action that increases the likelihood of the action being repeated in the future.

**History of Operant Conditioning**:
- Research on operant conditioning began with Edward Thorndike's puzzle box experiments (Figure 6.14) in the late 19th century at Harvard University.
- Thorndike wanted to know if cats could learn to escape from a puzzle box by performing specific actions. He motivated the cats with food outside the box and recorded the time it took for them to escape after accidentally discovering the solution.
- Through repeated trials, cats learned to perform the action (pressing a lever) that led to the satisfying state of affairs (escaping from the box), making it more likely for them to repeat the behavior in the future.

**B.F. Skinner and Operant Conditioning**:
- B.F. Skinner, one of the most prominent psychologists, developed a formal theory of operant conditioning based on Thorndike's law of effect.
- Skinner believed that behavior occurs because it has been reinforced and coined the terms "operant" and "reinforcer."
- He conducted experiments using a Skinner box, which is a simple device with a lever connected to a food supply, where an animal learns that pressing the lever results in food and is more likely to press the bar in the future.

**Application of Operant Conditioning**:
- Operant conditioning can explain why we choose to repeat certain behaviors based on their consequences. For example, if you enjoy watching a scary movie and get a satisfying state of affairs (enjoyment), you are more likely to watch more scary movies in the future. Conversely, if you dislike a movie, you are less likely to seek out similar films.

**Learning Goal Check**:
1. Studying an extra hour per day for the exam - operant (action performed on environment)
2. Getting an A on the exam - reinforcer (satisfying state of affairs)
3. Studying more hours for each exam in the future - operant conditioning (behavior is influenced by its consequences)

### 6.8 YOU CAN IMPROVE LEARNING THROUGH REINFORCEMENT

**Reinforcement**:
- Technique used to teach animals or people to perform desired behaviors by reinforcing behaviors that are increasingly similar to the desired behavior.
- Operant conditioning technique: selectively reinforces behaviors that get closer to the desired behavior.
- Powerful process for training animals to perform unusual feats and teaching people various skills.
- Used in psychology, education, and parenting to encourage appropriate behavior.

**Primary Reinforcers**:

- Satisfy basic needs (food, water, physical safety, social support).
- Most obvious reinforcers: directly related to survival.
- Learning value makes adaptive sense: animals that perform behaviors leading to primary reinforcers are more likely to survive and pass on genes.

**Secondary Reinforcers**:

- Do not directly satisfy basic needs but serve as reinforcers through classical conditioning.
- Established by associating a neutral stimulus with a primary reinforcer (money, grades).
- Generalization and discrimination learning occur: real vs. fake money or good grades for studying in different courses.

**Scenarios**:

1. **Primary Reinforcer**: Employee of the Month award could be considered a primary reinforcer if it includes tangible rewards like a plaque, trophy, or monetary bonus that satisfies basic needs (recognition and financial security).
2. **Secondary Reinforcer**: Pizza for lunch is a secondary reinforcer as it does not directly satisfy basic needs but serves as a reward for achieving a goal (exceeding monthly sales) and is associated with primary reinforcers like food and social interaction.

### 6.9 BOTH REINFORCEMENT AND PUNISHMENT CAN INFLUENCE BEHAVIOR

* Operant conditioning helps in teaching behaviors through reinforcement and punishment.
* Reinforcement increases the likelihood of a behavior, while punishment decreases it.

**Four Types of Reinforcement and Punishment**

* **Positive vs Negative**:
  * Addition or removal of a stimulus.
  * Increase or decrease in behavior.
* **Positive Reinforcement**:
  * Addition of a stimulus increases the probability of a behavior.
  * Rewards increase the frequency of behaviors.
* **Negative Reinforcement**:
  * Removal of an unpleasant stimulus increases the probability of a behavior.
  * Behavior is negatively reinforced for the person, but positively reinforcing for the organism.
* **Positive Punishment**:
  * Addition of an unpleasant stimulus decreases the probability of a behavior.
* **Negative Punishment**:
  * Removal of a pleasant stimulus decreases the probability of a behavior.

**Schedules of Reinforcement**

* **Four common schedules**:
  1. **Fixed Interval (FI)**: Reinforcement given after a fixed time interval.
     * Behavior increases just before reinforcement, then drops off.
  2. **Variable Interval (VI)**: Reinforcement given at unpredictable intervals.
     * Irregular reinforcement keeps behavior steady.
  3. **Fixed Ratio (FR)**: Reinforcement given after a fixed number of responses.
     * Behavior increases as the response rate approaches the required number.
  4. **Variable Ratio (VR)**: Reinforcement given at unpredictable ratios.
     * Unpredictability keeps behavior steady or even increases it.

**Four Schedules of Reinforcement**

The four schedules of reinforcement can be easily remembered by asking two questions:

1. Is the schedule predictable or does it change? (Fixed or Variable)
2. Does the schedule refer to the amount of time that has passed or to the number of responses that have occurred? (Interval or Ratio)

**Variable Interval (VI)**

* Reinforcement is provided after an unpredictable amount of time has passed
* **Example**: Pop quizzes in a class
* Leads to more consistent response rates than Fixed Interval schedules

**Fixed Interval (FI)**

* Reinforcement is provided after a fixed amount of time since the last reinforcement
* **Example**: Factory workers paid by the piece, or a coffee shop giving regular customers a free cup of coffee after 10 cups

**Variable Ratio (VR)**

* Reinforcement is provided after an unpredictable number of responses
* **Example**: Slot machines
* Persistence of behavior is greater under partial reinforcement than continuous reinforcement

**Partial-Reinforcement Extinction Effect**

* Behavior persists longer under partial reinforcement than continuous reinforcement
* Explained by the fact that during continuous reinforcement, the learner easily detects when reinforcement has stopped and behavior weakens through extinction. However, with partial reinforcement, the learner needs to keep repeating the behavior over time to notice the absence of reinforcement, making it more resistant to extinction

**Terms and Concepts**

* **Positive Reinforcement**: Addition of a stimulus to increase the probability that a behavior will be repeated
* **Negative Reinforcement**: Removal of a stimulus to increase the probability that a behavior will be repeated
* **Positive Punishment**: Addition of a stimulus to decrease the probability that a behavior will recur
* **Negative Punishment**: Removal of a stimulus to decrease the probability that a behavior will recur
* **Fixed Interval (FI) schedule**: Reinforcing the occurrence of a particular behavior after a predetermined amount of time since the last reinforcement
* **Variable Interval (VI) schedule**: Reinforcing the occurrence of a particular behavior after an unpredictable and varying amount of time since the last reinforcement
* **Fixed Ratio (FR) schedule**: Reinforcing a particular behavior after that behavior has occurred for a predetermined number of times
* **Variable Ratio (VR) schedule**: Reinforcing a particular behavior after the behavior has occurred for an unpredictable and varying number of times
* **Partial-reinforcement extinction effect**: The greater persistence of behavior under partial reinforcement than under continuous reinforcement.

### 6.10 POSITIVE PUNISHMENT IS OFTEN INEFFECTIVE

* **Positive punishment**: addition of an unwanted consequence to decrease a behavior (e.g., spanking, yelling)
* Contemporary psychologists argue that positive punishment is often ineffective and may have unintended consequences
* **Misapplied punishment**: punishing desirable behaviors (e.g., student gets punished for telling the truth)
* Students learn to avoid punishment rather than learning appropriate behavior
* **Skinner**: people learn how to avoid punishment, not how to behave appropriately
* Reinforcement is a more effective method for teaching desirable behavior
* **Physical punishment**: ineffective and associated with negative outcomes (e.g., aggression, antisocial behavior, mental health problems)

**Ineffectiveness of Physical Punishment**

* Common in the US but rates have dropped significantly over the past 50 years
* Beliefs about appropriateness influenced by religious beliefs, cultural views, and legal issues
* Banned in some countries (Austria, Denmark, Israel, Sweden, Italy)
* Recent research found spanking was not effective in improving children's behavior and associated with negative outcomes

**Teaching Desirable Behaviors Effectively**

* Reinforcement is a more effective method for increasing desirable behaviors (complimenting good behavior)
* **Teaching a child to look both ways before crossing the street**:
	+ Model the behavior
	+ Provide positive reinforcement when they do it correctly
	+ Use clear instructions and explanations
	+ Create a safe environment for practice
	+ Gradually increase independence and responsibility.

### 6.11 CAN BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION HELP YOU LEARN TO EXERCISE REGULARLY?
####  USING PSYCHOLOGY IN YOUR LIFE 

**Behavior Modification**:
- Use of operant conditioning techniques to eliminate unwanted behaviors and replace them with desirable ones.
- Based on the premise that most undesirable behaviors have been learned and can be unlearned.
- Effective for teaching productivity, energy conservation, safe driving, communication skills, and treating psychological conditions.
- Can be used for personal behavior change, such as increasing physical activity.

**Secondary Reinforcement**:
- A type of operant conditioning where a new stimulus (token) is introduced to reinforce desired behaviors.
- Chimpanzees can be trained using tokens that they can later trade for food.
- Token economies used in prisons, psychiatric hospitals, schools, and classrooms to encourage good behavior and give participants control over their environment.

**Using Behavior Modification for Exercise**:

1. **Identify a behavior you want to change**: Increase physical activity.
2. **Set goals**:
   - Realistic, specific, measurable.
   - Quickly achievable and objectively measurable.
   - Incremental subgoals leading to ultimate goal.
3. **Monitor your behavior**:
   - Practice metacognition.
   - Record observations in a notebook or use an app.
4. **Select a reinforcer and decide on a reinforcement schedule**:
   - Attainable and enjoyable reward.
   - Consistent reinforcement for desired behavior.
5. **Reinforce the desired behavior**:
   - No exceptions, no premature rewards.
   - Consider exercising with a partner for added motivation.
6. **Modify goals, reinforcements, or reinforcement schedules as needed**:
   - Increase challenge and change reinforcers.

### 6.12 BIOLOGY AND COGNITION INFLUENCE OPERANT CONDITIONING

* Behaviorists believed that all behavior could be explained by conditioning principles, but this is not the case as biological factors can influence reinforcement and learning can occur in the absence of it.

**Dopamine Activity Affects Reinforcement**:

* Positive reinforcement provides both subjective pleasure (liking) and increased desire for the object or event that produced the pleasure (wanting).
* Biological factors, particularly dopamine, play a role in these processes.
* Dopamine release increases with deprivation of basic needs like food and water, making them more rewarding.
* Endorphins are also involved in the liking aspect of reinforcement.
* Dopamine influences the reinforcing value of stimuli in operant conditioning.
* Drugs that block dopamine's effects disrupt operant conditioning, while drugs that enhance dopamine activation increase the reinforcing value of stimuli and contribute to addictive behavior.

**Biology Constrains Reinforcement**:

* Animals have a hard time learning behaviors that go against their biological predispositions due to evolutionary forces.
* Raccoons, for example, have trouble learning not to rub objects because it's an innate behavior used to identify food.
* Learning is most effective when the association between response and reinforcement is consistent with the animal's built-in biological predispositions.

**Learning Without Reinforcement**:

* Edward Tolman argued that reinforcement has more impact on performance than on acquisition of knowledge through learning.
* Rats in his experiments developed cognitive maps (mental representations of their environment) during maze navigation, even without reinforcement.
* The rats demonstrated their learning only when they started receiving reinforcement, a process called latent learning.

**Latent Learning Challenges Traditional Operant-Conditioning Theory**:

* Latent learning challenges the idea that all behavior is determined by reinforcement alone.
* It suggests that learning can take place in the absence of reinforcement and that animals have an internal representation of their environment.

**Learning by Watching Others**:

* We learn many behaviors not by doing them but by watching others do them.
* Observational learning, modeling, and vicarious conditioning are three ways we learn from observing others.
* These learning methods are essential for acquiring mechanical skills, social etiquette, attitudes, and more.

### 6.13 THERE ARE THREE WAYS YOU LEARN BY WATCHING OTHERS

**Observational Learning**:

* **Definition**: The acquisition or modification of a behavior after exposure to at least one performance of that behavior.
* Children learn basic skills, safety habits, and fear of dangerous objects/situations through observing adults.
* Bandura's research in the 1960s demonstrated children's tendency to imitate aggressive behaviors observed in adults (Bandura et al., 1961).
* Prosocial learning can also occur through observational learning, such as acquiring volunteerism or compliments from observing others.

**Modeling**:

* **Definition**: Demonstrating a behavior to imitate a behavior that was previously observed.
* Humans and animals readily imitate the actions of others and learn new things
* Modeling is influenced by factors like attractiveness, high status, similarity, and physical capability of the observer.

**Vicarious Conditioning**:

* **Definition**: Learning the consequences of an action by watching others being reinforced or punished for performing the action.
* This learning affects their likelihood of engaging in that behavior at a later time.
* Children's behavior is influenced by observing siblings being rewarded or punished for their actions.

**Evaluating Psychology in the Real World**:

* Discussion on the impact of violent media and video games on children's aggression levels.
* Encourages critical thinking about the credibility, evidence, and agreement of sources regarding the claim that watching violent media causes aggression in children.

### 6.14 BIOLOGY INFLUENCES OBSERVATIONAL LEARNING

* Empathy and emotional response during observational learning may be due to mirror neuron activation
* Mirror neurons become activated when observing someone performing a goal-directed action
* Mirror neurons are not activated by inanimate objects or people just sitting
* Similar neural circuits fire in both the observer's and the observed person's brains
* **Debated functions of mirror neurons**: support observational learning, explain and predict behavior of others, empathy and understanding

**Mirror Neurons**

* Neurons that fire both when an individual performs an action and when they observe someone else performing the same action
* Located in the premotor cortex and parietal lobes
* Activation occurs in observer's brain during observational learning

**Observational Learning and Mirror Neuron Activity**

* During observational learning, mirror neurons become activated when observing someone performing a goal-directed action
* Empathy and emotional response may result from mirror neuron activation
* Similar neural circuits firing in both observer's and observed person's brains
* Mirror neuron activity does not always lead to imitation of behavior being observed

**Learning Goal Check**

* When observing someone engage in a behavior you are learning, such as playing a musical instrument, mirror neurons in your brain become activated.
* This activation may help explain and predict the behavior of the person you're observing, allowing for better understanding and empathy.

## 7 MEMORY

**Creating and Maintaining Memories**

* Memory is the ability to obtain and retain information and skills for later use.
* **Creating memories involves three processing phases**: encoding, storage, and retrieval.

**Encoding**

* During encoding, you take in information from experiences and change it into a meaningful neural code that can be stored in the brain.
* This process occurs when you read, listen, or observe new information.
* Encoding is essential for learning and remembering new information.

**Storage**

* In the storage phase, newly created neural codes are maintained for a period of time.
* Storage can last from a fraction of a second to a lifetime.
* The length of storage depends on several factors, including the importance of the information and how often it is accessed.

**Retrieval**

* Retrieval is the process of accessing stored information when it is needed.
* Successful retrieval requires that the first two phases of encoding and storage have gone well.
* Retrieval can be influenced by various factors, such as attention, motivation, and emotional state.

**Strategies for Improving Memory**

* **Active processing**: focusing on information to remember it
* **Deep processing**: manipulating and working with information at a deeper level
* **Repetition**: accessing and rehearsing information repeatedly over time
* **Elaborative encoding**: connecting new information to existing knowledge
* **Mnemonic devices**: using memory techniques to help encode and retrieve information.


### 7.2 YOUR MEMORIES ARE UNIQUE

**How Selective Attention Influences the Creation of Unique Memories**

**Key Concepts**:
- Human memory is imperfect and unique due to the complexity of the brain, individual processing, and limited attention.
- Selective attention plays a crucial role in creating memories by allowing us to focus on relevant information while ignoring irrelevant details.

**Why Human Memory is Imperfect and Unique**:
1. **Complexity of the Brain**: The human brain is much more complicated than a computer, with dynamic neurons and synapses that change over time.
2. **Individual Processing**: Each person's processing of experiences leads to unique memories based on their perceptions and related events. Memories are not "truth" but rather our perception of what occurred.
3. **Limited Attention**: Human attention is limited, and we can only focus on a certain amount of information at a time. This limitation helps us function in the world by allowing us to prioritize important information.

**Role of Selective Attention in Memory Creation**:
1. **Paying Attention**: Attention is essential for conscious awareness of information and memory creation. We direct our attention to specific information at the cost of paying less attention to other details.
2. **Limited Capacity**: When attention is divided among too many tasks or difficult tasks, performance on each task suffers. This can lead to a lack of memory for the information.
3. **Selective Processing**: Our brains selectively process and remember information based on its relevance and importance.

**Impact of Limited Attention on Learning**:
1. **Multitasking**: Multitasking during class, such as using electronic devices, can make it difficult to pay attention and create memories for important information.
2. **Monitoring Attention**: Actively monitoring your attention and focusing on learning goals can help ensure better memory creation and academic performance.
3. **Selective Listening**: Research shows that we can selectively attend to certain stimuli while ignoring others, such as the cocktail party phenomenon or the McKenna effect.
4. **Emotional Reactions**: Stimuli that cause emotional reactions are more likely to capture our attention and be remembered.
5. **Faces**: Our brains prioritize faces due to their social significance, making them more likely to be attended to and remembered.

**Check Your Understanding**:
Suppose one student, Darren, uses selective attention to focus on his instructor's lecture better than another student, Luisa. Summarize how this difference will affect each student's ability to create new memories about the class material:
- Darren, by focusing his attention on the instructor's lecture, is more likely to encode and store the information effectively, leading to a stronger memory of the material.
- Luisa, by dividing her attention between the instructor's lecture and other distractions, may not encode and store the information as efficiently, resulting in weaker memories of the material.

### 7.3 YOU MAINTAIN INFORMATION IN THREE MEMORY STORES

**Three Memory Stores Model**

- Proposed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin in 1968
- Information flows from sensory to short-term to long-term storage

**Memory Stores**

1. **Sensory Storage**
   - **Function**: Lets perceptions appear as unified wholes
   - **Encoding**: In the sense it is experienced (visual, auditory, taste, smell, touch)
   - **Duration**: 
     - Visual: under 1 second 
     - Auditory: 3-4 seconds
   - **Capacity**: Vast due to huge amount of sensory input

2. **Short-Term Storage**
   - **Function**: Maintains information for immediate use
   - **Encoding**: Primarily auditory, also visual and semantic
   - **Duration**: Under 20 seconds
   - **Capacity**: About 7 items, plus or minus 2

3. **Long-Term Storage**
   - **Function**: Stores information for access and use at a later time
   - **Encoding**: Primarily semantic, also visual and auditory
   - **Duration**: Indefinite with working memory manipulation of items
   - **Capacity**: Probably unlimited

**Four Processes**

1. **Encoding**: The process by which information is converted into a form that can be stored in memory.
2. **Attention**: Focusing mental resources on specific information to facilitate encoding and storage.
3. **Working Memory**: Temporary active storage and manipulation of information.
4. **Retrieval**: Bringing stored information back into conscious awareness when needed.

### 7.4 SENSORY STORAGE LETS YOU MAINTAIN INFORMATION VERY BRIEFLY

**Sensory Storage**

- Brief maintenance of sensory information in the nervous system
- Allows us to have a unified experience of the world around us
- Five types: visual, auditory, smell, taste, touch

**Visual Sensory Storage**

- Maintains visual input for a very brief period
- Lets us see the trail of light left by a sparkler or "see" the world during blinks
- Duration: about one third of a second

**Auditory Sensory Storage**

- Maintains auditory input briefly
- Allows us to repeat last few words someone spoke even when not paying attention
- Duration: similar to visual sensory storage

**Types and Capacity of Sensory Storage**

- Three rows of four letters were flashed in a study, participants could only recall a few
- Participants maintained many of the 12 items in sensory storage for about one third of a second
- After that very brief period, the trace of the memory in sensory storage faded

**Effects on Perception**

- Allows us to experience the world as a continuous stream of information rather than discrete sensations
- Enables us to "fill in" visual information during blinks or watch movies smoothly

**George Sperling's Study**

- Participants were asked to recall all 12 letters or just one row based on a sound signal
- Results showed that many of the 12 items are maintained in sensory storage for about one third of a second
- After that brief period, the trace of the memory in sensory storage faded

### 7.5 WORKING MEMORY LETS YOU ACTIVELY MAINTAIN INFORMATION IN SHORT-TERM STORAGE

**Working Memory** and its Role in Increasing the Duration and Capacity of Short-Term Storage

**Background**:

- Initially, short-term storage was seen as a simple buffer or holding place for information.
- Newer research reveals that it includes the important process of working memory.

**Definition**:

- Working memory: lets you work on the information in short-term storage by repeating or visualizing it.

**Duration of Short-Term Storage**:

- Without using working memory, information is maintained for under 20 seconds.
- Using working memory to repeat letters allows maintaining them for as long as attention is paid.

**Capacity of Short-Term Storage**:

- Limited to a certain number of items (7+-2, according to Miller).
- Capacity increases with development and decreases with aging.
- Chunking information into meaningful units increases capacity by reducing the number of items to be remembered.

**Working Memory Processes**:

1. **Repeating**: Repeating a phone number or letters silently in your head.
2. **Visualizing**: Remembering information through mental imagery, such as visualizing a cow sitting on a chair.

**Chunking**:

- Using working memory to organize information into meaningful units (e.g., TSA CA FBI MS CIA IL DEA).
- Reduces the number of items to be remembered and makes them easier to recall due to their meaning.

### 7.6 LONG-TERM STORAGE LETS YOU MAINTAIN MEMORIES RELATIVELY PERMANENTLY

**Long-Term Storage** is a relatively permanent type of memory that enables us to remember a vast amount of information throughout our lifetime. It has nearly limitless capacity and duration, unlike short-term memory. Long-term storage plays a crucial role in helping us adapt to our environment by encoding information that is essential for survival and reproduction.

**Deep Encoding for Long-Term Storage**: requires paying attention to the details of the information and processing it deeply. 

This can be achieved through two types of rehearsal:

* **Maintenance Rehearsal**: Repeating an item over and over without attending to its meaning, which results in shallow encoding and less successful long-term storage.
* **Elaborative Rehearsal**: Thinking about how new information relates to ourselves or our prior knowledge, which provides deeper encoding of the information for more successful long-term storage.

Deep encoding improves the likelihood of long-term storage by activating more brain regions and increasing the chances of remembering the information. To remember information effectively, it is essential to put in extra effort through elaborative rehearsal, even after feeling confident that you have learned the material.

**Long-Term Storage vs. Short-Term Storage**: Although long-term storage lasts longer and has a greater capacity than short-term storage, they are not entirely separate memory systems. 

The primacy effect (better recall of items presented at the beginning of a list) and recency effect (better recall of the most recent items) suggest that there is a difference between short-term and long-term storage. 

Primacy effects are likely due to retrieving information from long-term storage, while recency effects are due to retrieving information from short-term storage.

### 7.7 YOUR LONG-TERM STORAGE IS ORGANIZED BASED ON MEANING

Long-term storage is organized based on the meaning of information for efficient retrieval. This means that memories are not stored randomly but are categorized and linked according to their significance and meaning.

* **Chunking**: Memories are encoded into meaningful groups or chunks, which depend on schemas. The more meaningful the chunks, the better they will be stored and remembered.
* **Schemas**: Cognitive structures that aid in perception, organization, processing, and use of information. They help make sense of new information by guiding attention to relevant features and filling in missing information based on existing knowledge. However, schemas can lead to biased encoding and retrieval.
* **Association Networks**: Memories are connected through associations, forming a network where each unit of information is a node, and each node is linked to other nodes. Activating one node increases the likelihood that closely associated nodes will also be activated, making retrieval easier.

**Types of Long-Term Memories**

Long-term memories differ in terms of the type of information encoded and stored, as well as the effort required for storage and access. The next four study units discuss different types of long-term memories:

1. **Procedural Memory**: Memories for motor skills, habits, and procedures, such as riding a bicycle or playing an instrument. These memories are often unconscious and automatic.
2. **Declarative Memory**: Explicit memory for facts and concepts, which can be consciously recalled and verbally expressed. Declarative memory is further divided into episodic memory (memories of personal experiences) and semantic memory (general knowledge).
  - **Episodic Memory**: Memories of specific events or episodes, such as your first day at school or a memorable vacation. These memories include the time, place, and context in which the event occurred.
  - **Semantic Memory**: General knowledge about the world, including facts, concepts, and vocabulary. Semantic memory is not tied to any particular context or personal experience.

### 7.8 THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF AMNESIA

**Types of Amnesia**:

* **Retrograde Amnesia**: An inability to access memories that were created before a brain injury (Figure 7.16a). In Molaison's case, he lost the ability to remember personal information, facts, and events that occurred prior to his surgery in September 1953.
* **Anterograde Amnesia**: An inability to create new memories after a brain injury (Figure 7.16b). After Molaison's surgery, he could not form new long-term memories.

**Memory and Careers**:

Understanding memory is crucial for various professions, including criminal justice and hospitality industries:

* **Criminal Justice**: Memory plays a significant role in solving crimes. Victims and eyewitnesses may have unreliable memories due to emotions or other factors, making it challenging for law enforcement and legal professionals to build strong cases.
* **Hospitality**: In the hospitality industry, employees must remember various details such as drink recipes, names, and orders to provide excellent customer service. Techniques like mnemonics can help improve memory retention in these situations.

**Henry Molaison's Case**:

Molaison, born in 1926, suffered from severe epilepsy that caused seizures originating in his temporal lobes. In an attempt to control the seizures, doctors removed parts of his medial temporal lobes, including the hippocampus, in September 1953. The surgery stopped Molaison's seizures but resulted in amnesia, specifically anterograde amnesia.

**Amnesia and Brain Damage**:

Amnesia involves two forms of memory loss:

* **Retrograde Amnesia**: Loss of memories for past events, facts, people, and personal information (pre-existing memories).
* **Anterograde Amnesia**: Inability to create new memories after the brain injury.

### 7.9 YOUR EXPLICIT MEMORIES INVOLVE CONSCIOUS EFFORT

**Long-Term Memory and Explicit Memories**

Memory involves the retention of information and skills. Long-term memory is composed of several interacting types, including explicit memories which are the focus of this unit. Explicit memories are conscious memories that can be verbally described.

**Episodic vs. Semantic Memory**

Endel Tulving identified two types of explicit memory: 

- **Episodic Memory**: Personal experiences, including information about the time and place each experience occurred.
  * Memories of specific events
  * Can blur together similar events
  - Women have better episodic memory than men
- **Semantic Memory**: Knowledge of facts independent of personal experience.
  * Facts, concepts, or rules
  * Not tied to specific times or places

College exams primarily test semantic memory. People with highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM) have a rare ability to remember most details from their lives but do not perform better on semantic memory tasks.

### 7.10 YOUR IMPLICIT MEMORIES FUNCTION WITHOUT CONSCIOUS EFFORT

**Implicit Memory**

* Form of memory that functions without conscious effort or intention
* Revealed in the case of H.M., who could not form new explicit memories but could learn new motor tasks (implicit memories)

**H.M. and Implicit Memory**

* After surgery, H.M. could not form new explicit (episodic) memories
* However, he was able to retain implicit memories in long-term storage
* Improved performance on mirror drawing task over three days, indicating retention of information
* Able to work at a factory after surgery due to ability to learn motor skills

**Implicit Memory vs. Explicit Memory**

* **Implicit memory**: memories that are not conscious or declarative
* **Explicit memory**: memories that can be consciously recalled and described in words

**Types of Implicit Memory**

* **Classical Conditioning**:
	+ Unconscious association between a stimulus and response
	+ Example: fear response to dentist due to past pain experiences
* **Procedural Memory (Motor Memory)**:
	+ Unconscious memory for motor skills and behavioral habits
	+ Example: muscle coordination for riding a bicycle or playing an instrument

**Implicit Memory in Everyday Life**

* Influences purchasing decisions through constant exposure to brand names
* Cannot be consciously recalled but still affects behavior

**H.M.'s Brain and Implicit Memory**

* Ability to form new implicit memories after surgery suggests parts of medial temporal lobe not necessary for storing these types of memories
* Implicit memory is a unique long-term storage system distinct from explicit memory

**Procedural Memory (Motor Memory)**

* Involves learning motor skills and behavioral habits
* Unconsciously known "how to" information
* Lasts a long time and is difficult to forget

### 7.11 MEMORY IS PROCESSED BY SEVERAL REGIONS OF YOUR BRAIN

**Memory Processing by Brain Regions**

* Over the past 20 years, researchers have made significant progress in understanding brain memory processing.
* Separate types of long-term storage exist, and distinct brain regions process information for each type.

**Types of Memory and Brain Regions**

* **Explicit (declarative) memories**:
  * **Hippocampus**: important for forming new explicit memories. Damage to this area results in anterograde amnesia.
  * **Prefrontal cortex**: particularly important for working memory.
* **Implicit (non-declarative) memories**:
  * **Temporal lobes (hippocampus)**: less important for implicit memories, such as classical conditioning and procedural memory.
  * **Cerebellum**: plays a role in implicit memory, especially in procedural memory for learning motor actions.
  * **Amygdala**: crucial for emotional memories and fear conditioning.

**Memory Formation and Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)**

* Memory formation involves communication between neurons at the synapse.
* LTP is the strengthening of synaptic connections that makes learning possible.
* **Hebbian learning theory**: "Neurons that fire together, wire together."

**Consolidation of Memories**

* The process by which experiences become lasting memories through the strengthening of neural connections.
* Medial temporal lobes (including hippocampus) are responsible for coordinating and strengthening connections among neurons when learning something.
* Actual storage of memories occurs in cortical brain regions engaged during perception, processing, and analysis of material being learned.

**Reconsolidation of Memories**

* Once memories are activated, they need to be consolidated again for long-term storage.
* Reconsolidation means that memories can change each time they are retrieved.
* New information becomes paired with the retrieved memory to create a new, reconsolidated memory.

**Accessing Stored Memories**

* The third phase of processing information is accessing stored memories at a later date for use.
* **Three processes affect the ability to access stored memories**: retrieval cues, attention, and interference.

### 7.12 RETRIEVAL CUES HELP YOU ACCESS YOUR MEMORIES

**Retrieval Cues**: Retrieval cues are stimuli or factors that help access memories stored in long-term memory. 

**Here are three ways retrieval cues can be used**:

- **Encountering Stimuli**: Encounters with specific stimuli can automatically trigger memories. These stimuli can be anything, such as smells, songs, or familiar buildings. The properties of an experience are encoded along with the memory and can later aid retrieval.
- **Context and State**: The context and state at the time of encoding can serve as powerful retrieval cues. This includes physical locations, odors, background music, and internal states like emotions or physiological conditions. When you are in the same context or have a similar state during both encoding and retrieval, it enhances your access to the memory. This effect is known as context-dependent memory and state-dependent memory.
- **Prospective Memory**: Prospective memory refers to remembering to do something at an appropriate future time. It involves trying to remember to perform some intentional act later. Prospective memory can be aided by retrieval cues, such as seeing Juan might trigger the memory to give him a message. However, for events without obvious cues, tools like sticky notes or electronic devices can serve as reminders.

**Mnemonics**: Mnemonics are learning aids that use retrieval cues to improve access to memory. They can be phrases, acronyms, or other strategies that help associate new information with what is already meaningful. This deeper form of encoding during the use of mnemonics makes this strategy effective at helping retrieval.

### 7.13 YOU FORGET SOME OF YOUR MEMORIES

**Ways of Forgetting Memories**:

1. **Interference**:
   * Forgetting due to the presence of competing memories.
   * **Two types**:
     1. **Retroactive Interference**: Older memories impair access to newer memories.
     2. **Proactive Interference**: Newer memories impair access to older memories.

2. **Blocking**:
   * Temporary inability to recall a memory.
   * Frustrating but common phenomenon.
   * Occurs due to interference from similar words or experiences.

3. **Absentmindedness**:
   * Inattentive or shallow encoding of events.
   * **Major cause**: Failing to use selective attention to focus on relevant information and ignore irrelevant information.

**Impact on Learning**:

* Memory and learning work by connecting information.
* Environmental and physical cues help in remembering new concepts.
* Brain training programs claim to improve memory, but their effectiveness is debated.

**Forgetting Curve**:

* Hermann Ebbinghaus's study on forgetting showed that the more time spent learning material, the less forgotten.
* Applies to meaningful material as well.

**Impact on Real Life**:

* Some people have exceptional memories but struggle with everyday life due to an overload of information (e.g., Russian newspaper reporter).
* Not being able to forget can be as maladaptive as not being able to remember.

### 7.14 YOUR MEMORIES CAN BE DISTORTED

**Memory Distortion**

Human memory is not as accurate as we might think. Memory distortion occurs in various ways:

**Memory Bias**:

* People tend to recall past beliefs and attitudes consistent with their current ones.
* Revise memories when they contradict attitudes and beliefs.
* Remember events casting us in a favorable light or where we played a prominent role.
* Exaggerate our contributions to group efforts.
* Remember successes more than failures.

**Flashbulb Memories**:

* Vivid, seemingly perfect memories of surprising, consequential, or emotionally arousing events.
* **Research challenges**: studying immediately after the event and comparing memories over time.
* People tend to repeat their flashbulb memory stories, increasing confidence.
* Flashbulb memories are not necessarily more accurate than ordinary memories but are at least as accurate.

**Misattribution**:

* Misremembering the time, place, person, or circumstances involved with a memory.
* **Source amnesia**: remembering an event but forgetting where the information came from.
* **Cryptomnesia**: recalling old ideas as new without attributing them to their proper source.

**Source Amnesia**:

* Forgetting the source of a memory, leading to misattribution.
* **Example**: students taking verbatim notes and later plagiarizing unintentionally.

**Cryptomnesia**:

* Believing you have come up with a new idea when it's actually an old one retrieved from memory without attribution.
* **Example**: George Harrison's "My Sweet Lord" plagiarism case.

**Suggestibility**:

* Memories can be influenced by misleading information.
* Witness testimony can be inaccurate due to suggestibility, leading to wrongful convictions.
* **Examples**: participants recalling a car passing a stop sign they saw as a yield sign or remembering broken glass in a video where none existed.

#### Eyewitness Testimony Errors

* **Michael McAlister case**: misidentified due to resemblance to police sketch based on eyewitness description (Carlson et al., 2017)
* Eyewitness testimony prone to error when not paying sufficient attention during the event (McAlister's case, real perpetrator looked similar)
* **Factors contributing to errors**:
  + Focusing on irrelevant details (weapons, etc.)
  + Police interview techniques affecting memory (Wixted & Wells, 2017)
    - Lineups or photospreads
    - Unintentional influence by officers
* Procedures to reduce false eyewitness identifications (Wells et al., 2020)
  + Taking testimony immediately and before memory contamination

**False Memories**

* People can develop false memories for words or entire events
* **List experiment**: recall as many words as possible from a list, some of which are not on the list (Roediger & McDermott, 1995)
* False memories result from semantic activation and related word confusion (Chadwick et al., 2016)
* People with HSAM are just as susceptible to false memories for words they did not see (Patihis et al., 2013)
* **False memories for entire events**:
  + Loftus' study: Chris was told about a "lost in the mall" incident and later falsely remembered it (Loftus, 1993)
  + Seven of 24 participants in a later study also developed false memories (Loftus & Pickrell, 1995)
* **Explanation**: mental images of imagined events can be confused with real memories
* Children are especially susceptible to developing vivid false memories for episodic events

## 8 THINKING AND INTELLIGENCE

* This chapter explores aspects of thinking, including decision making and problem solving, and how they relate to intelligence.
* **The text discusses two examples of individuals with exceptional cognitive abilities**: Muhammad Haryz Nadzim, a child prodigy, and Phiona Mutesi, who became a chess champion despite her lack of formal education.

**What is Thinking?**

* Thinking is the mental manipulation of internal representations of information.
* Cognitive psychologists study thought and understanding.
* Humans use both analogical and symbolic representations in their thinking.

**Analogical and Symbolic Representations**

* Analogical representations are images that have some physical characteristics of the objects they represent. For example, a mental image of a lemon or a drawing of a violin.
* Symbolic representations are abstract and consist of words or ideas. For instance, the word "hamburger" or "violin."
* Both types of representations are essential for human thought and problem-solving.

**Mental Maps**

* Mental maps combine analogical and symbolic representations to help us think about the world around us.
* They can lead to errors due to limited knowledge representation.

**Impact Learning Pause**:

* Thinking deeply is crucial for learning, but it requires effort and active engagement with the material.
* Successful students use various techniques to deepen their understanding of concepts.

### 8.2 SCHEMAS AND CONCEPTS ARE THE BASIS OF THINKING

**Schemas and Concepts**:

- Schemas are mental structures that help organize information and guide thought and behavior. They are related to analogical and symbolic representations.
- Organize objects effectively and efficiently by creating mental representations (analogical and symbolic) and using schemas to categorize them.

**Schemas**:

- Mental structures that help us understand and interact with the world.
- Long-term memories are organized based on schemas.
- Useful because: many situations have consistent attributes, people have specific roles within contexts, and they allow for efficient thinking about objects and events.

**Categorization**:

- Grouping things based on shared properties to create categories.
- Two musical instrument categories: country music instruments and orchestral music instruments.
- Concepts are mental representations used to categorize related objects, events, or ideas based on shared features.

**Concepts**:

- Mental representations used for categorizing related objects, events, or ideas based on shared features (such as musical instruments or fruits).
- Organize information efficiently by storing concepts based on the properties shared by certain items or ideas rather than every instance individually.

**Prototype Model**:

- According to this model, concepts are based on the most typical member of a category, called the prototype.
- Decide whether an item belongs in a category by comparing its characteristics with those of the prototype.
- An orange is considered prototypical for the concept of Fruit due to its shared features (edible, seeds, sweet taste).
- Non-prototypical instruments, like trash cans used in Stomp, can still be considered musical instruments because they produce musical sounds.

**Exemplar Model**:

- According to this model, there is no single best representation of a concept; instead, all examples encountered form the basis of the representation for that concept.
- Prototypes are simply exemplars that have been encountered more frequently.
- Representation of dogs is made up of all the dogs (exemplars) you have encountered in your life.
- Compare new animals with memories of other animals to determine their category.

### 8.3 SCHEMAS ARE THE BASIS OF STEREOTYPES

**Schemas and Stereotypes**

* Mental representations and classifications of objects, events, and people
* Prototype and exemplar models explain how we categorize and represent concepts in our mind
* **Effects of having schemas**:
  + Allow appropriate behavior in various settings based on knowledge of rules, roles, and generalizations
  + Lead to development of stereotypes through generalizations about people, events, or objects

**Effects of Schemas on Daily Life**

* Consistent rules in common situations (e.g., students sit at desks in classrooms)
* Specific roles within situational contexts (e.g., students behave differently than diners in restaurants)
* Quick processing and generalizations about people, events, or objects called stereotypes

**Stereotypes and Unintended Consequences**

* Can reinforce sexist or racist beliefs about certain groups
* **Example**: children's drawings of scientists often depict men due to unconscious schema
* Negative consequences for underrepresented racial and ethnic groups in STEM fields (e.g., women, Black, Hispanic students)
* Limits opportunities based on stereotypes (e.g., orchestras composed only of men due to belief that women are inferior musicians)

**Three Forms of Thinking**

* **Reasoning**: forming logical arguments and making judgments based on evidence
* **Decision making**: choosing among alternatives based on values, goals, and information
* **Problem solving**: finding solutions to complex issues or challenges

**Schemas and Stereotypes Relationship**

* Schemas are mental frameworks that help us understand and navigate the world
* Stereotypes are generalizations based on schemas that can lead to biases and discrimination
* It's important to be aware of our schemas and challenge any stereotypical thinking.

### 8.4 BIASED REASONING CAN LEAD TO FAULTY BELIEFS

**Biased Reasoning vs. Formal Reasoning**

- **Informal reasoning**: using personal experiences, opinions of others, and hearsay to make judgments.
- **Formal reasoning**: using standardized and objective procedures of the scientific method to collect empirical evidence and test hypotheses.

**Three Ways Biased Reasoning Leads to Faulty Conclusions**

1. **Confirmation Bias**:
   - People tend to pay greater attention to evidence that supports their beliefs and ignore or downplay evidence that does not.
   - Can lead to many types of false beliefs due to the ease of finding "evidence" on the Internet for just about anything.
2. **Illusory Correlation**:
   - Misperception that two chance events that happen at the same time are related.
   - Can lead to superstitious behavior.
3. **Hindsight Bias**:
   - Tendency to believe that one could have predicted something after learning the outcome.
   - Once information is known, it seems obvious to people.
   - People who are very confident about their knowledge are especially likely to show hindsight bias.

### 8.5 HOW YOU THINK BIASES DECISION MAKING

**Decision Making**

- Form of thinking used to select among choices 
- Based on identifying important criteria and determining how well each alternative satisfies these criteria
- People use heuristics and are influenced by framing to make decisions, which can lead to faulty reasoning

**Heuristics**

- Shortcuts used to reduce the amount of thinking needed to make a decision
- Occur unconsciously and require minimal cognitive resources
- Three most commonly used heuristics: 
  - availability
  - representativeness
  - affective

- **Availability Heuristic**
  - Mental shortcut used to assess how common or probable something is based on how quickly information comes to mind
  - Judgments influenced by the availability of examples that come to mind
- **Representativeness Heuristic**
  - Mental shortcut used to place people or objects in a category based on how closely they match the prototype for that category
  - Can lead to faulty reasoning if base rates are not taken into account
- **Affective Heuristic**
  - Mental shortcut used to make decisions or judgments based on current emotions
  - People often decide based on how they would feel in a situation
  - Poor at affective forecasting (predicting future emotions)

**Framing**

- Way information is presented can alter how it is perceived and influence decisions
- Can significantly influence decision making, especially under time pressure

**Decision Making Biases**

- a. **Availability bias**: remembering news story about roller coaster malfunction
- b. **Framing effect**: people more likely to buy $10 product when offered 10% off
- c. **Affective bias**: Jason's regret over sports car purchase
- d. **Representativeness bias**: defense attorney's belief that clients who dress poorly are more likely to be convicted of crimes

### 8.6 HOW CAN YOU BE SATISFIED WITH BIG DECISIONS?
#### USING PSYCHOLOGY IN YOUR LIFE 

**Understanding Maximizers and Satisficers**

* People experience conflict and indecision when faced with an excessive number of attractive choices
* Having too many options can lead to bad decisions and impair thinking (Schwartz, 2004)
* **Iyengar & Lepper's study on jam selection**: 6 choices led to more sales than 24 (Figure 8.14)
* **Two approaches to decision making**: 
  - maximizing
  - satisficing

**Maximizers vs. Satisficers**

* Maximizers aim for the perfect choice among options
* Satisficers seek a "good enough" choice that meets minimum requirements
* Maximizers tend to choose objectively best option but less happiness (Hsieh & Yalch, 2020)
* College graduates with maximizing tendencies have higher salaries but lower satisfaction (Iyengar et al., 2006)

**Impact of Maximizing on College Students**

* **Leach and Patall's study**: maximizers spent more time second-guessing decisions, leading to lower satisfaction with chosen major

**Strategies for Satisficing in Choosing a Major**

* Approach decision making as a satisficer
* Identify minimum requirements for a good course of study
* Stick with the decision and accept it
* Have realistic expectations
* Practice an attitude of gratitude
* Understand that there are many fine options

**Advising a High School Junior on College Choices**

* Encourage limiting choices to a smaller number of schools
* Narrowing down options can lead to more focused and informed decision making
* Reduces decision fatigue and anxiety
* Helps in creating a clearer picture of preferred colleges and their offerings
* Allows for a deeper exploration of the chosen colleges, increasing the chances of finding a good fit.

### 8.7 YOU SOLVE PROBLEMS TO ACHIEVE GOALS

1. **Subgoals**:
  - Breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts or subgoals.
  - Each subgoal is a step towards achieving the main goal.
  - Important for solving many problems, especially those with multiple steps.
2. **Working Backward**:
  - Starting from the desired goal state and working backwards to the current state.
  - Useful when the appropriate steps for solving a problem are not clear.
3. **Analogy**:
  - Finding similarities between a current problem and a previously solved problem.
  - Using the solution to the previous problem as an analogy to solve the current problem.
4. **Insight**:
  - Sudden realization or understanding of a solution to a problem without conscious effort.
  - Often happens when one stops actively thinking about the problem.

**Problem Solving Strategies Summary**:

| Strategy | Characteristics | Sample Problem | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Subgoals | Identify the goal state and several subgoals to be achieved | Repair a car muffler without enough money | Research best price, cut spending, work more hours |
| Working Backward | Begin from the goal state and work backward to the current state | Graduate in two years with required credits | Identify credits needed per term, this term, and classes |
| Analogy | Identify a previously solved problem that is similar to the current problem | Cook beef with broccoli without soggy broccoli | Consider how moisture ruins sandwich in lunch bag |
| Insight | Take a break from actively thinking about the problem and the answer may spontaneously become apparent | Solve a difficult calculus homework problem | Put problem away and wait for the solution to come |

### 8.8 YOU OVERCOME OBSTACLES TO SOLVE PROBLEMS

**Changing Representations in Problem Solving**:

- **Problem solving as rethinking**: Getting a joke and solving problems both require revising mental representations to overcome obstacles.

**Strategies for Revising Mental Representations**:

1. **Restructuring**:
   - **Strategy**: Mentally representing a problem in a novel way to reveal hidden solutions.
   - **Example**: The nine-dot problem requires thinking outside the box (literally) to connect all dots using only four lines.
2. **Overcoming Mental Sets**:
   - **Definition**: Established ways of thinking that may hinder finding the best solution.
   - **Example**: Thinking about events in June, July, and August for the question "What happens once in June, once in July, and twice in August?" leads to a mental set, making it difficult to find the correct answer ("the letter u").
3. **Overcoming Functional Fixedness**:
   - **Definition**: Thinking of objects based on their usual functions, which may limit problem-solving possibilities.
   - **Example**: The Duncker candle problem requires thinking creatively to use the box as a stand instead of just attaching the candle directly to the wall with tacks.

### 8.9 ONE GENERAL FACTOR MAY UNDERLIE INTELLIGENCE

**General Intelligence and IQ Scores**

* Intelligence is the ability to reason, make decisions, understand complex ideas, learn quickly, and adapt to environmental challenges. (intelligence)
* Binet's approach to assessing intelligence involved a collection of high-level mental processes, leading to the development of the first intelligence test in 1905. (Binet, IQ tests)
* The test included various types of questions yielding an overall Intelligence Quotient (IQ) score. (IQ scores)

**Theory of General Intelligence**

* Charles Spearman found that people who perform well on one type of intellectual task also tend to perform well on others, suggesting a single underlying factor. (Spearman, general intelligence)
* This theory posits that there is a single common factor, or general intelligence, that influences performance on any intellectual task. (general intelligence)
* This factor has been shown to be universal for humans across cultures. (universal general intelligence)
* General intelligence influences important life outcomes such as academic and professional success, socioeconomic status, and health. (impact of general intelligence)

**Fluid and Crystallized Intelligence**

* **Raymond Cattell proposed that general intelligence consists of two types**: fluid and crystallized intelligence. (Cattell, fluid and crystallized intelligence)
* Fluid intelligence involves information processing in novel or complex circumstances, reasoning, drawing analogies, and thinking quickly and flexibly. (fluid intelligence)
* Crystallized intelligence pertains to knowledge gained through experience, such as vocabulary, spelling, and cultural information, and the ability to use this knowledge to solve problems. (crystallized intelligence)
* People who score high on one factor are likely to score high on the other, suggesting that strong crystallized intelligence is aided by strong fluid intelligence. (relationship between fluid and crystallized intelligence)

**Learning Goal Check**:

* Jamila demonstrates a high degree of crystallized intelligence, while Stijn demonstrates a high degree of fluid intelligence.

### 8.10 THERE MAY BE ALTERNATIVE TYPES OF INTELLIGENCE

* Psychologists agree on the existence of general intelligence but recognize multiple aspects or dimensions of intelligence.

**Dimensions of Intelligence**

**Fluid and Crystallized Intelligence**:

* General intelligence is made up of fluid and crystallized intelligence.
* **Fluid intelligence**: thinking quickly and flexibly in novel, complex situations.
* **Crystallized intelligence**: knowledge from experience that is used to solve problems.

**Creativity**:

* Creativity is the ability to engage in novel thinking that produces successful outcomes.
* Divergent thinking involves coming up with many solutions or ideas.
* Convergent thinking involves generating the single best solution.
* Creativity can be assessed through tests of divergent thinking.

**Multiple Intelligences**:

* Gardner's theory identifies several different types of intellectual talents:
  - musical
  - mathematical/logical
  - intrapersonal
  - interpersonal
  - linguistic
  - spatial
  - bodily-kinesthetic
* Each person has a unique pattern of intelligences.

**Triarchic Theory**:

* **Sternberg's theory identifies three types of intelligence**: analytical, practical, and creative.
* Analytical intelligence is similar to general intelligence.
* Practical intelligence refers to the ability to deal with everyday tasks.
* Creative intelligence involves gaining insight and solving novel problems.

**Emotional Intelligence**:

* Emotional intelligence (EI) consists of four abilities: managing emotions, using emotions to guide thoughts and actions, recognizing other people's emotions, and understanding emotional language.
* People high in EI are good at understanding emotional experiences and responding productively.
* EI is correlated with personal relationships, academic performance, and coping skills.

**Alternative Types of Intelligence: Examples**

a. A contestant on Survivor uses a stick and some charcoal from the fire to brush her teeth - *practical intelligence*
b. Malcolm develops a business that helps people in his community recycle and compost - *practical intelligence, creativity*
c. Peter is an effective college president because he knows how to control his emotions and has excellent relations with others - *emotional intelligence*
d. Serena Williams is often able to outthink her opponents on the tennis court - *fluid intelligence*

### 8.11 INTELLIGENCE IS A RESULT OF GENES AND ENVIRONMENT

* **Nature vs. Nurture Debate**: Haryz Nadzim's exceptional early intelligence raises questions about the role of genetics (nature) versus environmental influences (nurture) in intelligence.

**Genetic Influence on Intelligence**:

* **Behavioral Genetics**: Studies like twin and adoption research suggest a genetic component to intelligence.
  * Identical twins, regardless of upbringing, show high correlation in IQ scores.
  * Shared environment has little impact on the intelligence of adopted children.
* Thousands of genes contribute to intelligence, each with a small effect.

**Environmental Influence on Intelligence**:

* **Prenatal and Postnatal Factors**: Nutrition, drugs, alcohol use, socioeconomic status, education, cultural beliefs, and drug/alcohol use can impact intelligence.
* **Enriched Environment**: Breastfeeding, intellectual opportunities, schooling, and critical thinking skills contribute to intelligence development.

**Interaction of Genes and Environment**:

* Education enhances cognitive abilities, which in turn predict increased educational attainment.
* Practice and initial intelligence interact in predicting skill development (e.g., chess).

**Impact on Learning**:

* **Adopted siblings with similar grades but different IQ scores**: Their different IQ scores are more likely explained by environmental factors, as they shared the same family environment but not identical genes.

**Intelligence Measurement**:

* Standardized tests are one way to measure intelligence, but there are other ways to assess it (e.g., performance tasks, self-report measures).

### 8.12 INTELLIGENCE IS ASSESSED WITH PSYCHOMETRIC TESTS

**Psychometric Tests**: Standardized tests used to assess various aspects of intelligence, including achievement tests, aptitude tests, and intelligence tests. They have uniform procedures for objective scoring and must have reliability and validity.

**Achievement Tests vs. Aptitude Tests**:

* **Achievement tests**: Measure current skills and knowledge, often used for college admissions or to assess what has been learned in the past.
* **Aptitude tests**: Assess ability to learn new skills in the future, used by employers to determine job suitability.

**Modern Intelligence Tests**:

* **Stanford-Binet Test**: First intelligence test for children, based on mental age and IQ scoring.
* **Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)**: Measures both verbal and performance intelligence in adults.

**Intelligence Quotient (IQ)**: A score based on the number of questions answered correctly on an intelligence test, determined by dividing mental age by chronological age and multiplying by 100.

**Validity and Reliability**:

* **Validity**: Intelligence tests should measure what they claim to measure - intelligence.
* **Reliability**: Consistent results over time for the same individual.

**Validity**: Research shows that intelligence tests, such as the Miller Analogy Test, can predict academic performance and job success.

**Reliability**: Repeated testing yields similar IQ scores.

**Cultural Bias**: Critics suggest that intelligence tests may penalize individuals from certain cultures due to language and cultural differences. Nonverbal tests, like those on the WAIS, help minimize cultural bias.

### 8.13 INTELLIGENCE IS ASSOCIATED WITH COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE

* **Intelligence and Cognitive Processes**: Intelligence is associated with various cognitive processes, including speed of mental processing, working memory, and attention.

**Speed of Mental Processing**:

* People with lower intelligence scores respond more slowly on tests of reaction time than those with higher intelligence scores (Deary, 2000).
* Tested through simple reaction time (pressing a key as quickly as possible when a stimulus appears) and choice reaction time (choosing the correct response for the stimulus presented).
* Intelligence test scores are more strongly related to choice reaction time than simple reaction time (Jensen, 1998).

**Working Memory and Attention**:

* General intelligence is closely related to working memory.
* Simple tests of memory (repeating a list of words in order) show only weak association with general intelligence.
* Complex memory tests that require secondary processing (solving math problems while remembering words) show strong relation between working memory and general intelligence.
* Connection between working memory and attention, which involves focusing mental resources on information to be processed.
* Importance of staying focused for accomplishing complex tasks.

**Savants**:

* Individuals with exceptional abilities in specific areas despite minimal intellectual capacities in most areas are known as savants.
* Savant abilities can include math, music, or art.
* Savants often have brain anomalies and score low on intelligence tests (e.g., Kim Peek scored 87).
* The combination of prodigious memory and the inability to learn basic tasks is a mystery.

**Learning Goal Check**:

* Choice reaction time tests are more related to general intelligence than simple reaction time tests.

## 9 MOTIVATION AND EMOTION

**Motivation and Behavior**

- People are motivated to act due to emotions and the desire to achieve goals. (Malala Yousafzai's story)
- Motivation influences behavior in various ways.

**What Motivates Your Behavior?**

- Questions about motivation: What inspires you, why do you choose certain actions, importance of achieving goals?
- Malala Yousafzai's motivation to fight for girls' education.

**Factors That Motivate Behavior**

**9.1 Many Factors Influence Motivation**

- Motivation is a process that energizes, guides, and maintains behavior toward meeting specific goals or needs.
- Four internal factors: 
  - activating
  - directive
  - sustaining
  - varying in strength
- One external factor: incentives.

**Satisfaction of Needs**

- A need is a state of deficiency that motivates behaviors to help satisfy the need.
- Biological (food, water) and social needs (achievement, love).
- Maslow's Need Hierarchy: survival, safety, love/belongingness, esteem, self-actualization.
- Humanistic psychology focuses on personal fulfillment.

**Drive Reduction**

- A drive is a psychological state that motivates behaviors to satisfy a need.
- **Homeostasis**: maintaining equilibrium in the body.
- Thirst and hunger drives as examples.

**Incentives**

- External objects or goals that motivate behaviors.

**Maslow's Need Hierarchy (Humanistic Psychology)**

- People are driven by many needs, with some being more important than others.
- Needs must be addressed in order from the bottom up.
- **Self-actualization**: living up to one's unique potential and being truly happy.

**Limitations of Maslow's Need Hierarchy**

- Lacks scientific support.
- The ranking of needs is not as simple as the pyramid suggests.
- People may ignore physiological needs for other needs.

**Motivation and Arousal**

* Brain mechanisms respond to temperature changes by initiating responses such as sweating or shivering, and people may be motivated to adjust clothing accordingly (homeostasis)
* Basic biological drives include hunger and thirst, which create increased arousal leading to the need satisfaction and reduction of arousal

**Optimal Arousal and Performance**

* The more deprived of something, the greater the drive to satisfy the need
* Increased arousal refers to brain activity or autonomic nervous system responses (sweating, muscle tension, heart rate change)
* Activities that arouse people can be stimulating, exciting, or frightening
* Optimal level of arousal varies among individuals
* Each person has their own optimal level of arousal that motivates them to engage in certain behaviors
* Too much arousal may overwhelm a person, while too little arousal may leave them bored
* Sensation seeking questionnaire (Table 9.2) can help determine individual's optimal level of arousal
* The Yerkes-Dodson law describes the relationship between arousal, motivation, and performance
	+ Performance improves with arousal up to an optimal point
	+ After that point, more arousal results in declining performance (Figure 9.6)

**Motivation: Needs and Drives**

* Motivation is the process that energizes, guides, and maintains behavior toward meeting specific goals or needs
* Needs are states of biological or social deficiency
* Drive is a psychological state that creates arousal and motivates behaviors to satisfy a need

**Motivation: Pleasure Seeking**

* Sigmund Freud proposed that needs are satisfied based on the pleasure principle
* People do things that feel good (pleasure) and avoid things that feel bad (pain)
* The pleasure principle helps explain why people behave in ways that don't necessarily satisfy biological needs
* Pleasure-seeking behavior is adaptive from an evolutionary perspective

**Motivation: Incentives**

* People are motivated by external objects or goals, called incentives, rather than internal drives
* External factors can motivate behaviors, such as getting a good grade or avoiding a bad grade
* Incentives can be positive (rewards) or negative (punishments)
* Incentives can influence motivation and behavior in various contexts, including education, work, and relationships.

### 9.2 SOME BEHAVIORS ARE MOTIVATED FOR THEIR OWN SAKE

* Motivation can be intrinsic or extrinsic, depending on the reason for engaging in an activity.
* **Intrinsic Motivation**: The desire to perform an activity for its own sake, derived from enjoyment or personal satisfaction. (Chu & Schulz, 2020)
	+ Examples: Reading a good novel, taking a walk, listening to music, mastering a topic in a course
	+ Intrinsic motivation can satisfy natural curiosity and creativity
	+ Playful exploration is an intrinsically motivated behavior that helps animals learn about their environment
	+ Intrinsic motivation can lead to creative pursuits like art, music, or cooking
* **Extrinsic Motivation**: The desire to perform an activity to achieve an external goal, such as receiving a reward. (Deci & Ryan, 1987; Lepper et al., 1973)
	+ Examples: Earning good grades, getting a paycheck
* **Impact of Extrinsic Rewards on Intrinsic Motivation**:
	+ According to self-determination theory, extrinsic rewards can reduce intrinsic motivation because they make the behavior feel less like a personal choice. (Deci & Ryan, 1987)
	+ According to self-perception theory, people may infer their motives based on observable behaviors, and receiving an external reward provides an alternative explanation for engaging in the activity, reducing the perceived intrinsic value. (Bem, 1967)
* Both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation can influence behavior, depending on the person and situation.

### 9.3 MOTIVATION TO EAT IS AFFECTED BY BIOLOGY

**Biological Systems Influencing Motivation to Eat**

Everyone requires food for survival, and eating is not only essential but also a source of pleasure. People consume between 80,000 and 90,000 meals throughout their lives. The motivation to eat arises from various biological systems that monitor nutrient levels in the body and motivate eating or drinking to restore homeostasis. This study unit focuses on three primary biological mechanisms that influence eating:

**Biological Mechanisms That Motivate Eating**

1. **Signals From the Body**:
   - Stomach contractions and expansions cause stomach growling, but they play a minor role in hunger motivation.
   - **Receptors** in the bloodstream monitor levels of vital nutrients like glucose, which provides energy and influences mood and mental clarity.
   - **Insulin**, produced by the pancreas, manages glucose levels and reduces motivation to eat when insulin levels are high.
   - **Ghrelin**, a hormone originating in the stomach, surges before meals and decreases after eating, potentially triggering hunger signals.
   - **Leptin**, released from fat cells, travels to the brain to stop eating behavior by making food less appetizing.
2. **The Brain**:
   - The **hypothalamus** is the primary brain structure influencing eating and body weight. Damage to specific areas of the hypothalamus can lead to obesity or anorexia.
   - The **gustatory cortex** processes taste cues, making food more rewarding and increasing cravings.
   - The **limbic system**, involved in emotion and rewards, is associated with responses to tasty food.

### 9.4 MOTIVATION TO EAT IS ALSO INFLUENCED BY LEARNING

* Motivation to eat is influenced by various factors beyond physiological needs, including conditioning, familiarity, cultural influences, and flavor.

**Conditioning**

* People are classically conditioned to associate certain times of the day with meals, leading to anticipatory responses that motivate eating behavior.
* Regular mealtimes act as a conditioned stimulus, triggering a learned response to eat.

**Familiarity**

* People tend to prefer foods they were raised on and have had more experience with.
* Familiarity shapes food preferences and influences what people continue to eat as adults.
* Infants and toddlers learn food preferences from observing parents and siblings.

**Cultural Influences**

* Cultural experiences shape motivation to eat or not eat certain foods.
* Food traditions around holidays and family practices can influence eating habits.
* Ethnic differences in food preference often persist when families move to new countries.

**Flavor**

* Humans have an innate preference for sweetness, which is adaptive.
* Modern diets high in added sugars can change preferences for natural sweetness.
* Availability of a variety of flavors promotes eating and encourages people to eat more.

**Applying Learning Goal Check**:

If your friend is trying to lose weight, a buffet restaurant might not be the best choice because:

* Buffets offer an abundance of food choices, which can lead to overeating due to the availability of various flavors and the all-you-can-eat nature of the meal.
* People tend to eat more when presented with a variety of foods compared to having only a few options.
* Your friend may be tempted to try multiple dishes, potentially consuming more calories than intended.
* It's essential for your friend to focus on portion control and making healthy choices to support their weight loss goals. Instead, suggest a restaurant that offers smaller portions or healthier meal options.

### 9.5 PEOPLE HAVE A NEED TO BELONG

- Humans are social animals, and the need to belong is a fundamental motive that drives behavior (Baumeister & Leary, 1995).
- Over the course of human evolution, living in groups increased chances of survival, reproduction, and gene transmission.
- The need to belong motivates people to form social bonds and groups.
- People are sensitive to signs of group rejection and feel anxious when excluded (MacDonald & Leary, 2005; Gardner et al., 2005).
- Lack of social contact causes emptiness and despair, just as a lack of food causes hunger.

**People Are Motivated to Form Groups**

- The need to belong theory explains why most people make friends easily and form social groups (Brewer & Caporael, 1990).
- Not belonging to a group increases risk for negative consequences such as illness and premature death.
- People feel anxious when facing exclusion from their social groups and pay more attention to social information.

**Importance of Belongingness**

- A sense of belonging is important for how people feel and perform in a given environment (Figure 9.14).
- College students who feel they belong are more engaged, successful, and have better mental health (Gopalan & Brady, 2019; Romero, 2018).
- Belongingness develops when people feel respected, valued, and supported by others in their social settings.

**Belonging Uncertainty**

- Belonging uncertainty is common for individuals in new social spaces, particularly those from underrepresented groups.
- Belonging uncertainty can lead to worry and feelings of being an imposter.
- Effective methods have been developed to increase belongingness for members of underrepresented groups (Walton & Cohen, 2011).

**Application: Ryker vs. Alexis**

- Ryker is a first-generation college student and feels nervous about fitting in. He has lunch with Jacob, another first-generation student who shares his experiences and gives him strategies for academic success.
- Alexis wants to be an astronaut but is nervous about being one of the few women in her major. She has lunch with Isabella, a senior astrophysics major who describes how she felt alone in her first year but eventually found friends and a sense of belonging in a club.

### 9.6 PEOPLE HAVE A NEED TO ACHIEVE LONG-TERM GOALS

* Motivation applies to long-term aspirations as well as short-term goals.
* Achievement motivation is the need or desire to attain a certain standard of excellence.
* **Four factors affect one's ability to achieve long-term goals**: the goals themselves, self-efficacy, delayed gratification, and grit.

**Achievement Motivation**

* Proposed by Henry Murray in the 1930s as a psychosocial need.
* People are motivated to achieve long-term personal goals.
* Those high in achievement motivation set challenging but attainable goals.
* Students with high achievement motivation perform better academically.

**Factors Affecting Long-Term Goal Achievement**

**Good Goals**

* Challenging and specific goals are best for motivation and success.
* Focusing on concrete, short-term goals helps in achieving long-term goals.

**Self-Efficacy**

* Personal expectations for success play a role in motivation to achieve long-term goals.
* Self-efficacy is the belief that one's efforts will lead to success.
* People with high self-efficacy set challenging but realistic goals and are more likely to succeed.

**Ability to Delay Gratification**

* The ability to resist immediate rewards in favor of long-term benefits is essential for achieving long-term goals.
* Techniques for delaying gratification include ignoring the temptation or distracting oneself from it.
* The ability to delay gratification is linked to better life outcomes, including higher SAT scores and better school grades.

**Grit**

* People with grit have a deep passion for their goals and a willingness to persevere through challenges.
* Grit is more important than natural talent in achieving long-term goals.
* Grit is a significant predictor of student outcomes, including college grades and graduation from West Point.

**Emotions**

* Emotions are an integral part of motivation and behavior.
* Emotions serve as heuristic guides that help us make quick decisions.
* Understanding emotions requires answering questions about what emotions are and how we experience them.

### 9.7 EMOTIONS ARE PERSONAL BUT LABELED AND DESCRIBED CONSISTENTLY

**Emotions** are immediate, specific responses to environmental events or internal thoughts, shaping all aspects of human experience. They have three components:

* **Physical response**: Emotions are associated with physical changes in the body, such as a faster heartbeat when riding a roller coaster.
* **Thoughts and actions**: Emotions influence our thoughts and behaviors, affecting how we perceive situations and make decisions.
* **Subjectivity**: Each person experiences emotions differently, making them subjective.

**Emotions can be labeled as primary or secondary.**

* **Primary emotions (basic emotions)**: Evolutionarily adaptive, shared across cultures, and associated with specific physical states. They include anger, fear, sadness, happiness, disgust, and possibly surprise and contempt.
* **Secondary emotions**: Blends of primary emotions. Most emotional experiences involve secondary emotions, which are numerous and complex. Examples include remorse, guilt, submission, shame, anticipation, and awe.

**Moods** are long-lasting emotional states that do not have an identifiable object or trigger. They influence thought and behavior but do not interrupt what is happening. Moods refer to people's vague senses of feeling certain ways.

Emotions can be described consistently using the **circumplex model,** **which plots emotions along two dimensions**: valence and arousal.

* **Valence**: Refers to how negative or positive the emotion is.
* **Arousal**: Describes the extent to which the emotion causes increased brain activity or autonomic responses (such as quickened heart rate, increased sweating, or muscle tension).

**Jealousy** is a secondary emotion, as it is a blend of emotions such as fear, sadness, and anger.

### 9.8 THREE MAJOR THEORIES EXPLAIN YOUR EMOTIONS

* **Contrasts the three theories explaining how emotions are experienced**: James-Lange, Cannon-Bard, and two-factor theory.

**James-Lange Theory**

* Bodily responses are the basis for feeling emotions.
* Physical changes in the body occur in distinct patterns that translate directly into specific emotions.
* When you perceive those physical responses, you feel emotions.
* **Implication**: Facial expressions trigger emotions (facial feedback hypothesis).

**Cannon-Bard Theory**

* Information about emotional stimuli is sent to the cortex (emotional experience) and the body (physical reactions) at roughly the same time.
* The mind and body experience emotions independently.
* Emotion-producing stimulus is initially processed in subcortical regions of the brain, then separate emotional response and physical reaction occur.

**Two-Factor Theory**

* A situation evokes both a physiological response (arousal) and a cognitive interpretation (emotion label).
* The cognitive interpretation leads to the feeling of emotion.
* Misattribution of arousal can occur, leading to incorrect emotion labels.

**Glossary**

* **James-Lange theory**: Theory stating that emotions result from physiological reactions in the body.
* **Cannon-Bard theory**: Theory stating that information about emotional stimuli is sent to the cortex (emotional experience) and the body (physical reactions) at roughly the same time.
* **Two-factor theory**: Theory stating that how we experience an emotion is influenced by the cognitive label we apply to explain the physiological changes we experience.

### 9.9 YOUR BODY AND BRAIN INFLUENCE YOUR EMOTIONS

Emotions are adaptive responses that help individuals survive and reproduce by influencing thoughts and behaviors.

**Emotions from Bodily Responses**:

- **Debate on the relationship between bodily responses and emotions**: Some research suggests that all emotions share core physical properties related to valence (positive or negative) and arousal, while others propose specific patterns of autonomic nervous system responses for each emotion.
- **Research on the two-factor theory hypothesis**: Schachter and Singer's study showed that people attribute their feelings of arousal to environmental cues when they are unaware of the cause, thereby shaping their emotions.
- **Specific emotional states influence the body in predictable ways**: Frightened individuals have faster heartbeats and tense muscles, while nervous individuals perspire, among other responses.
- People's perception of bodily responses may play a role in how different emotions are experienced.

**Testing the Two-Factor Theory Hypothesis**:

- Participants were injected with adrenaline or a placebo and informed or not about its effects.
- Informed participants attributed their arousal to the drug, while uninformed participants looked to the environment for explanations.

**Conclusion**: Feelings of arousal can be influenced by environmental cues, shaping people's emotions.

**Emotions from Brain Activity**:

- Emotional processing occurs in various brain regions, including the amygdala, insula, and prefrontal cortex.
- Neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline play a role in emotional regulation.
- Brain activity can influence bodily responses through the autonomic nervous system.

**Interplay between Body and Brain**:

- Emotions arise from the complex interplay between bodily responses and brain activity.
- Both bottom-up (bodily responses) and top-down (cognitive processes) influences contribute to emotional experiences.

**Key Concepts**:

- **Circumplex Model of Emotions**: A model suggesting all emotions share core physical properties related to valence (positive or negative) and arousal.

**Emotional Responses in Lie Detection**

* Use of lie detectors or polygraphs to assess truthfulness
* Measures autonomic responses such as heart rate, respiration, and skin conductance
* Goal is to measure higher arousal when lying than when telling the truth
* **Problems with using polygraphs**:
	+ Innocent people falsely classified as deceptive
	+ Difficulty distinguishing between nervousness and lying
	+ Subjective judgment by investigator influenced by beliefs
	+ Psychologists view as unreliable in determining deception

**Polygraph Testing Process**

* Measures autonomic responses to critical questions and control questions
* Control questions assumed not to produce strong emotional response
* Differences in physiological responses used to determine lying

**Emotions from Brain Processes**

* Emotions result from brain activity, particularly amygdala
* Amygdala processes emotional significance of stimuli and generates immediate reactions
* Fast path for quick processing of sensory information
* Slow path for more deliberate evaluation of information
* Involved in perception of social stimuli and assessment of trustworthiness

**Amygdala Functioning**

* Processes emotional significance of stimuli
* Generates immediate emotional and behavioral reactions
* Protects animals from danger
* Contributes to emotional learning
* Fast path for quick processing of sensory information
* Slow path for more deliberate evaluation of information
* Involved in perception of social stimuli and assessment of trustworthiness

**Relation to Text Example**

* Freezing in fear when seeing a jellyfish is an example of fast path processing
* Relaxing and continuing swimming when realizing it's a plastic bag is an example of slow path processing.

### 9.10 MOST PEOPLE TRY TO REGULATE THEIR EMOTIONAL STATES

**Emotion Regulation Strategies**

* People attempt to regulate their emotional states in daily life to function normally and manage disruptive emotions
* Five techniques for emotion regulation: 
  - understanding motivation and emotion in sales, customer service, financial services; 
  - thought suppression and rumination; 
  - positive reappraisal; 
  - humor; 
  - distraction

**Understanding Motivation and Emotion in Sales, Customer Service, Financial Services**

* Knowledge of motivation and emotion essential for working with customers
* **Sales**: good salespeople understand what makes people think and act, leading to satisfied customers
* **Customer service**: dealing with angry customers, understanding emotions and their impact on thoughts and actions
* **Financial services**: understanding incentives, helping customers make financial decisions, controlling emotions related to money

**Thought Suppression and Rumination**

* **Thought suppression**: attempting to suppress negative thoughts, difficult and often leads to rebound effect
* **Rumination**: focusing on undesired thoughts or emotions, prolongs emotions and makes it harder to use successful regulation strategies

**Positive Reappraisal**

* Changing thoughts about an event in a positive way to regulate emotions
* Alters emotional reactions by thinking about events in more neutral or positive terms
* Studies show changes in brain activity when engaging in positive reappraisal

**Humor**

* Simple and effective method of regulating negative emotions
* Increases positive emotion, improves immune system, stimulates hormone release, decreases pain perception
* Coping mechanism in difficult situations, strengthens connections to others

**Distraction**

* Doing or thinking about something other than the troubling activity or thought to stop focusing on difficulties
* Temporarily helps reduce negative emotions but can backfire with maladaptive behaviors

**Emotions and Social Relationships**

* Emotions help promote social relationships by establishing social rules for showing emotions and detecting emotions in others to regulate emotional experiences.

### 9.11 YOU USE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS TO INTERPRET EMOTIONS

**Interpreting Emotions through Facial Expressions**

* People use facial expressions to interpret emotions and predict behavior of others.
* Darwin (1872) argued that facial expressions communicate emotions and are adaptive.
* Facial expressions provide information about a situation and help understand appropriate response.
* Research on facial expression often uses isolated faces, but context is important in real life.
* Facial expressions are similar across cultures, but there are subtle differences indicating learned meanings.

**Facial Expressions Across Cultures**

* Darwin hypothesized that facial expressions communicate emotions universally.
* Ekman et al. (1969) found cross-cultural agreement in identifying basic emotions from photographs.
* Subsequent research supports cross-cultural identification of some facial expressions, especially happiness.
* However, there are subtle differences indicating learned meanings and cultural variations.

**Physical Expression of Emotion: Biology vs. Culture**

* Pride responses are an example of a biologically based emotional expression.
* Young children and isolated populations can recognize signs of pride.
* Pride responses are similar across cultures, suggesting a biological basis.

**Display Rules**

* People learn what emotions to show based on cultural norms (display rules).
* Display rules vary across cultures and explain why identification of facial expressions is better within a culture than between cultures.
* Women and men tend to show different emotions in North American culture, with women displaying emotions more readily and men remaining expressionless.
* Gender differences in emotional expression reflect both learned patterns and biologically based differences.

### 9.12 EMOTIONS STRENGTHEN YOUR INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS

* Emotions play a crucial role in strengthening social relationships between individuals.
* For most of the 20th century, psychologists paid little attention to interpersonal emotions like guilt and embarrassment due to their association with Freudian thinking.
* Social emotions are essential for maintaining social bonds.

**Guilt**

* Guilt is a negative emotional state characterized by anxiety, tension, and remorse when we believe we have harmed another person.
* It discourages harmful behaviors and encourages relationship-strengthening actions.
* Displays of guilt demonstrate care for relationship partners and can be used to manipulate others.
* Socialization plays a significant role in determining how children experience guilt.
* Parental warmth is associated with greater guilt in children, suggesting that feelings of guilt arise in healthy relationships.

**Embarrassment and Blushing**

* Embarrassment is the recognition of an unintentional social error or violation of cultural norms.
* It can increase social bonds by restoring relationships after wrongdoing.
* Blushing, a common accompaniment of embarrassment, communicates an understanding of social awkwardness and serves as a nonverbal apology.

**Learning Goal Check**:

* Jocelyn's reaction of guilt and embarrassment for forgetting her husband's birthday will help the situation by demonstrating care and concern for their relationship, potentially leading to forgiveness and repairing the bond.

## 10 SEX, GENDER, AND SEXUALITY

**Introduction**:
- People's sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation are complex aspects of their being.
- Misconceptions about transgender people and their ability to serve in the military is based on misunderstandings rather than scientific evidence.

**Key Questions**:
1. What are the aspects of our biological sex?
2. How do we experience gender?
3. How do we vary in sexual orientation?
4. What motivates us to have sexual relations (or not)?

**Biological Aspects of Sex**:
- Biological sex is not determined by a single factor but rather by genetics and hormones.
- There are four aspects of biological sex: 
  - sex chromosomes
  - sex glands
  - secondary sex characteristics
  - primary sex characteristics

**Genetics and Hormones as Aspects of Biological Sex**:
1. **Sex Chromosomes**:
   - Determined at conception by the 23rd pair of chromosomes in the zygote.
   - Most common combinations result in XX for females and XY for males, but other combinations lead to non-binary sex.
2. **Hormones**:
   - Influence the development of secondary and primary sex characteristics.
   - Estrogens and androgens are key hormones that contribute to sexual development.
   - 
**Impact on Understanding Sexual Identity**:
- The binary labels of male and female do not accurately describe everyone's biological sex, as some people have non-binary sex.
- Our understanding of these topics can change over time and may challenge our beliefs and opinions.

**Conclusion**:
- The complexity and richness in how people think and feel about biological aspects of sex, gender, and sexual orientation are essential to understanding the diverse experiences of individuals.
- Scientific evidence challenges common misconceptions and sheds light on the complexities of these topics.

**Genetic Determination of Sex Glands**:

* Sex chromosomes establish sex in a zygote
* Y chromosome contains SRY gene, which triggers development of testes in embryos with any Y sex chromosomes (XY)
* Absence of SRY gene leads to development of ovaries in embryos without Y chromosomes (XX)

**Hormonal Influence on Sexual Development**:

**Primary Sex Characteristics**:

* Develop later in puberty after secondary sex characteristics appear
* Hormones such as estrogens and androgens influence development
* **Female primary sex characteristics**: maturation of uterus, vagina, and ovaries with egg cells
* **Male primary sex characteristics**: maturation of penis, testes, and beginning of sperm cell production

**Secondary Sex Characteristics**:

* Not directly related to sexual reproduction
* Appear around 8 years for girls and 10 years for boys
* Influenced by hormones including estrogens and androgens
* Develop body hair, oilier skin, increased body odor, growth spurt, breast development in girls, muscle mass and facial hair growth in boys

**Hormonal Milestones**:

* **Menarche**: first menstrual period for females, signaling ability to reproduce sexually
* **Spermarche**: first production of mature sperm for males, signaling ability to reproduce sexually

**Influence of Genetics and Hormones on Sexual Development**:

1. hair growth in underarms
   a. secondary sex characteristics
2. genetic female
   b. XX sex chromosomes
3. ovaries with egg cells
   c. primary sex characteristics
4. spermarche
   d. male primary sex characteristic

### 10.2 SOME PEOPLE EXPERIENCE VARIATIONS IN BIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF SEX

**Biological Aspects of Sex Beyond Binary Categories: Intersex and Differences in Sex Development (DSD)**

- **Differences in Sex Development (DSD)**: A term used to describe people who experience non-binary aspects of biological sex, including variations in sex chromosomes and sex characteristics.
- **Intersex**: A term some people prefer to describe their own experience of non-binary aspects of biological sex.
- **Sex Chromosomes**: Genetic material that determines the biological sex of an individual. The most common combinations are XX (female) and XY (male), but variations such as XXY (Klinefelter syndrome) and XO (Turner syndrome) exist.
- **Sex Hormones**: Hormones responsible for the development and maintenance of sexual characteristics.

**People Experience Variations in Sex Development**

- Some people experience variations in one or more aspects of biological sex, leading to DSD.
- These variations can be present from conception due to unusual combinations of sex chromosomes or sex hormones.
- DSD affects about 1 in every 4,500 to 5,000 live births but may be more common due to undetected sex chromosome differences.

**Causes of DSD**

- **Variations in Sex Chromosomes**: Unusual combinations of sex chromosomes can result in variations such as Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) and Turner syndrome (XO).
- **Variations in Sex Hormones**: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a condition where individuals are exposed to atypical levels of sex hormones in the womb, leading to ambiguous genitals. Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) occurs when individuals have XY chromosomes but their bodies do not respond to testosterone, resulting in underdeveloped male sexual characteristics.

**Impact on Individuals and Society**

- When a baby is born with ambiguous genitals, parents and doctors must decide how to proceed. Some studies suggest that sex assignment based on chromosomes and prenatal hormones may not accurately predict an individual's gender identity later in life.
- DSD advocacy groups now urge against performing genital surgeries on children until they are old enough to understand and communicate their own gender identity.

**Understanding Non-Binary Sex**

- Biological aspects of sex should be understood as a continuum, including varying levels and combinations of sex traits.
- The study of gender is evolving to support a non-binary model, recognizing that masculinity and femininity are not opposites or distinct categories.

### 10.3 THOUGHTS ABOUT GENDER AFFECT OUR PERCEPTIONS, EXPECTATIONS, AND ACTIONS

This section discusses the development of gender schemas and the changing expectations of gender roles in the United States. The understanding of gender is evolving rapidly, leading to a suggested "gender revolution."

**Gender vs. Sex**:

- Biological aspects of sex include multiple factors (genetic, hormonal, sex characteristics)
- Gender refers to social, cultural, and psychological aspects of masculinity and femininity

**Formation of Gender Schemas**:

- People organize information about gender into mental structures called schemas
- Gender schemas contain information about social expectations, traits, interests, thoughts, and feelings
- Binary gender schema divides the world into two distinct categories: masculine and feminine
- Developing rigid gender stereotypes can limit understanding of individuals and restrict their expression

**Impact of Marketing**:

- Historically, toys have been marketed based on binary gender schemas
- Current marketing trends aim to make toys attractive to children of all genders, reducing gender stereotypes

**Non-Binary Gender Schemas**:

- Some cultures acknowledge non-binary gender schemas and include gender roles beyond masculine and feminine (e.g., hijra in India and Bangladesh)

**Cultural Influences on Gender Roles**:

- Social experiences shape our understanding of gender roles
- Children learn gender roles through observational learning, media, and socialization
- Traditional gender roles are changing rapidly in North America

**Impact of Changing Expectations**:

- People are not bound by traditional gender roles
- Western cultures increasingly support children's personal uniqueness and expression of gender

### 10.4 GENDER IDENTITY IS HOW YOU THINK AND FEEL ABOUT YOUR OWN GENDER

**Gender Identity**

* Individual understanding of one's own gender
* Multifaceted and influenced by social and cultural information
* Cognitive development theory explains how people develop thoughts and feelings about gender

**Cognitive Development Theory of Gender Identity**

**Stage 1 (Ages 2-3)**

* Children create gender categories and use gender schemas interchangeably for themselves and others
* Apply terms to themselves inconsistently
* Do not understand that gender is stable or binary

**Stage 2 (Ages 4-7)**

* Children think of themselves and others in a stable, binary way
* Use gender labels consistently based on stereotypes
* Recognize that their own gender identity does not change with appearance or behavior

**Stage 3 (Ages 5-7)**

* Understand that external appearances do not indicate a person's gender identity
* Gender expression may vary across time and situations
* Gender identity is relatively stable, influenced by individual cognitive processes

**Gender Schemas**

* Social information about gender roles and expectations
* Influence how people categorize and understand gender
* People learn gender roles from social environment through observational learning, modeling, and operant conditioning

**Learning Tip**

* Gender schemas include information about gender roles and influence gender identity
* **Gender role socialization**: People learn gender roles from the social environment
* **Cognitive development theory**: People actively process their thoughts and feelings to describe their gender as binary or non-binary.

**Examples and Stages of Cognitive Development of Gender Identity**

| Example | Stage |
| --- | --- |
| Irfan knows that his brother's gender does not change with clothing and makeup | Third stage |
| Julia consistently refers to herself and anyone else with long hair as a girl | Second stage |
| Kai tells his mother he is a girl, then tells his teacher he is a boy | First stage |

### 10.5 PEOPLE VARY IN GENDER IDENTITY

**Key Concepts**:
1. **Gender Identity**: A person's internal sense of being a man, woman, or something else. It is not determined by biological sex.
2. **Sex**: Biological characteristics (chromosomes, hormones, anatomy) used to classify people as male, female, or intersex.
3. **Binary Gender Categories**: Man and Woman.
4. **Continuum Model**: A model that recognizes the fluidity of gender identity and expression.
5. **Cisgender**: Having a gender identity that matches the sex assigned at birth.
6. **Transgender**: Having a gender identity different from the sex assigned at birth.
7. **Non-binary**: Having a gender identity that is neither man nor woman, or both.
8. **Gender Expression**: The way people present their gender to others through behavior, clothing, hairstyle, voice, etc.

**Notes**:

1. **Traditional Thinking vs. Reality**: Traditional thinking of gender as binary (man or woman) is inadequate for understanding the diversity of gender identity and expression. Gender cannot be determined by examining a person's brain, hormones, or cognitive processes.
2. **Biological Aspects and Gender Identity**: Sex is best understood on a continuum, while gender can be better understood as a two-dimensional continuum with two axes: 
   - one for identifying as a woman to not identifying as a woman
   - the other for identifying as a man to not identifying as a man.
3. **Common Variations in Gender Identity**:
   - **Cisgender Man**: Biologically male and identifies as a man.
   - **Cisgender Woman**: Biologically female and identifies as a woman.
   - **Non-binary**: Identifies neither as a man nor a woman, or both.
      * Laverne Cox is an example of a transgender woman
      * She was assigned male at birth but always felt like a woman.
      * **Transgender Man**: Assigned female sex and identifies as a man.
      * **Transgender Woman**: Assigned male sex and identifies as a woman.
4. **Prevalence of Transgender Identity**: The prevalence of people with a transgender identity is increasing, especially among young people. In the 2020 Gallup survey, 0.6% of Americans identified as transgender. More people identify as transgender women than men.
5. **Development of Transgender Identity**: People who are transgender and cisgender develop their gender identities in similar ways. The mechanisms for how biological processes contribute to transgender or cisgender identity are unclear, but research shows that children think of themselves in terms of their gender identity, not their assigned sex.
6. **Gender Expression**: Transgender people may choose to alter their gender expression to match their personal gender identity, but they do not always opt for medical treatments like hormones or surgery.
7. **Prince's Gender Identity**: Based on his lyrics "I'm not a woman / I'm not a man / I am something that you'll never understand," Prince might have identified with the quadrant in Figure 10.13 that represents having a gender identity that is both female and male simultaneously.

**Non-Binary Gender Identity**

- Miley Cyrus and Prince are examples of individuals who do not identify strictly with the binary categories of gender identity or with traditional gender roles (Cyrus, 2014)
- Non-binary gender identities include those who identify as neither male nor female and those who identify as both (Liszewski et al., 2018)
- Terminology for non-binary gender identities is varied and evolving (Baron, 2020; Diamond, 2020)
  * Some prefer the umbrella term "non-binary"
  * Others may use more specific labels like genderqueer, agender, Two-Spirit, etc.

**Gender Dysphoria**

- People who experience distress due to perceived mismatches between their assigned sex and gender identity (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Lawrence, 2014)
- Not a psychological disorder in itself but can cause significant personal distress if present for six months or more (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Lawrence, 2014)
- Can result in anxiety, depression, and even suicide attempts due to social discrimination, victimization, or rejection (Herman et al., 2014; Meerwijk & Sevelius, 2017)

**Support for Transgender People**

- Progress in understanding and supporting gender diversity (Coolidge, 2014)
- Legal protections against workplace discrimination (Macy v. Holder, 2012; Movement Advancement Project)
- Laws allowing people to use bathrooms that match their gender identity (Movement Advancement Project)
- Successful lawsuits addressing transgender rights (Adams v. School Board of Alachua County, 2020)

### 10.6 HOW CAN YOU SUPPORT PEOPLE OF ALL GENDER IDENTITIES?

**American Psychological Association's Guidance**

* **Learn about gender identities**:
  * Recognize the wide range of gender identities.
  * Understand that non-binary and nonconforming gender expression do not necessarily mean transgender.
  * Use respectful language and ask for preferred name, pronouns when appropriate.
* **Respect people's privacy**:
  * Do not ask about biological aspects of a person's sex as it may be considered rude.
  * Let individuals decide what to share about their gender identity.
* **Understand the separation of gender identity and sexual orientation**:
  * Gender identity is distinct from sexual orientation.
* **Support human rights**:
  * Advocate for the rights of people regardless of their gender identity.
  * Resources like The Trevor Project offer crisis intervention and suicide prevention for LGBTQ+ youth.

**Applying Guidance in Supporting Gender Diversity**

* **Situation A**: You suspect Kyra is gender-fluid, but you should privately support her identity without making assumptions or outing her.
* **Situation B**: Asking Ihsan about his transgender identity after work is intrusive and disrespectful of his privacy.
* **Situation C**: Ask Maggie for her preferred pronouns in an appropriate situation to show respect for her gender identity.
* **Situation D**: Do not assume Chenoa's gender identity based on her background; ask for her preferred pronouns and respect her privacy.

**Understanding Sexual Orientation**

* **Personal questions about sexual orientation**:
  * Consider your feelings of sexual attraction to others.
  * Reflect on whom you are attracted to and if your attractions have changed over time.
* **Scientific understanding of sexual orientation**:
  * Research reveals that intuitions, beliefs, and opinions about sexual orientation may not align with scientific reality.

### 10.7 VARIATIONS IN SEXUAL ORIENTATION ARE COMMON

**Sexual Orientation: Variations and Complexities**

**Definition of Sexual Oorientation**:
Sexual orientation refers to a person's enduring sexual, emotional, and/or romantic attraction to other people (Bailey et al., 2016). It is not about whom a person has sexual relations with but rather describes to whom they are attracted.

**Four Common Variations in Sexual Orientation**:

1. **Heterosexual or Straight**:
   - People who are sexually, emotionally, and/or romantically attracted to individuals of a different sex.
   - A man attracted to women is straight (gynophilic).
   - A woman attracted to men is straight (androphilic).
2. **Homosexual or Same-sex Attraction**:
   - People who are sexually, emotionally, and/or romantically attracted to individuals of the same or similar sex.
   - A man attracted to other men may identify as gay (androphilic).
   - A woman attracted to other women may identify as lesbian (gynephilic) or gay.
3. **Bisexual**:
   - People who are sexually, emotionally, and/or romantically attracted to individuals of both the same and different sexes.
   - Some people prefer the term pansexual to indicate attraction to all variations in sex and gender identities.
4. **Asexual**:
   - People who do not experience sexual attraction but may have emotional and/or romantic attractions to others.

**Sexual Orientation as a Continuum**:
- People do not necessarily fit neatly into these categories, and many identify as somewhere between them.
- Sexual attraction can change with time or circumstance.
- Labeling sexual orientation is not always consistent with sexual behavior.

### 10.8 SEXUAL ORIENTATION HAS A BIOLOGICAL BASIS

**Sexual Orientation: Biological Basis**

* **Description of the three potential biological contributors to the development of sexual orientation**:
  * Genetics
  * Hormonal influences
  * Maternal immune system

**Personal Realization of Sexual Orientation**

* People's sexual attraction usually starts around adolescence.
* Straight, gay, and lesbian people report their sexual attraction beginning around age 10.
* Bisexual people report their sexual attractions a bit later, around age 13.
* Initial sexual orientation tends to remain relatively stable over time.
* Earlier personal awareness and public announcement of attraction (coming out) is associated with better psychological outcomes.

**Biological Factors vs. Social Environment**

* No causal theory of sexual orientation has gained widespread support due to ethical or scientific challenges.
* Research suggests that biological factors have a greater influence on sexual orientation than social factors.

**Genetic Explanations of Sexual Orientation**

* Identical twins share more genetic material and are more likely to have the same sexual orientation than fraternal twins.
* Hundreds of genes have been identified as increasing the likelihood of same-sex attraction.
* Men who identify as gay tend to have more gay-identified relatives, especially on their mother's side.
* Genes account for 8-25% of the variability in similar-sex orientation.

**Hormonal Influences on Sexual Orientation**

* Greater prenatal exposure to androgens is associated with same-sex attraction in women.
* Very little evidence exists for hormonal influences on men's sexual orientation.

**Maternal Immune System**

* Boys who have older brothers are more likely to be gay as adults than first-born males (fraternal birth order effect).
* This effect is limited to right-handed males and may be due to maternal antibodies influencing the development of male fetuses.

**Social Acceptance of Variation in Sexual Orientation**

* Attitudes toward people with diverse sexual orientations are becoming more positive.
* Marriage equality has been legalized in several countries and the US.
* Acronyms like LGBTQIA help create a sense of community among people who share experiences of stigma, prejudice, and discrimination.
* A career in social work and human services can be a good path for those who want to support people with diverse sex, gender, and attraction experiences.

**Factors Influencing Sexual Orientation Development**:
According to current research, a variety of factors influence the development of sexual orientation:

a. **Genetic Factors**:
   - No single gene determines sexual orientation.
   - Research suggests that multiple genes contribute to sexual orientation.
b. **Hormonal Factors**:
   - Prenatal hormones may play a role in shaping sexual orientation, but the exact influence is not fully understood.
c. **Environmental and Cultural Factors**:
   - Family environment, peer groups, societal norms, media exposure can all impact sexual orientation development.

**Motivation to Engage in Sexual Behavior**

**Desire**:
- The motivation to engage in sexual activity.
- Influenced by biological, environmental, and individual factors.

**Biological Factors**:
- Hormones, brain structure, genetics.

**Environmental and Cultural Factors**:
- Social norms, media exposure, peer groups, cultural values.

**Individual Differences**:
- Personality traits, attachment styles, past experiences.

### 10.9 BIOLOGY INFLUENCES THE MOTIVATION FOR SEXUAL ACTIVITY

* Alfred Kinsey's research in the 1950s revealed similarities in sexual attitudes and behaviors between men and women, but did not delve into the physical aspects of sex and their influence on motivation.
* Masters and Johnson's research in the late 1950s focused on observing and recording people's sexual behavior to understand the physiological aspects of sex and the sexual response cycle.

**The Sexual Response Cycle and Its Phases**

* **The sexual response cycle consists of four phases**: 
  - excitement
  - plateau
  - orgasm
  - resolution
* Men and women experience these phases differently.

**Excitement Phase**

* Occurs when people think about or begin sexual activity.
* Blood flows to genitals, and feelings of arousal occur.
* Men's penises become erect; women's clitorises swell and vaginas expand.
* Emotional closeness and intimacy can also contribute to arousal for women.

**Plateau Phase**

* Increased pulse rate, breathing, and blood pressure.
* Passion takes control, inhibitions are lifted.

**Orgasm Phase**

* Involuntary muscle contractions throughout the body.
* Women may not always experience orgasm or may have multiple orgasms.
* Biological, relational, and social factors influence women's likelihood of orgasm.

**Resolution Phase**

* Men enter a refractory period during which they are unable to maintain an erection or have an orgasm.
* Length of refractory period varies significantly between men.
* Women do not have a refractory period and may experience multiple orgasms without resolution phases between each one.

**Hormonal Influence on Sexual Desire and Behavior**

* **Hormones**, particularly those produced in the hypothalamus, influence sexual behavior by regulating sex hormone production in the gonads (testes for men, ovaries for women).
* **Androgens** (testosterone) are the most important hormone for sexual desire in humans.
* Men usually have higher levels of **testosterone** and more consistent sexual motivation than women.
* Women's **estrogen** levels vary over time, which may account for their periodic fluctuations in sexual motivation.
* Testosterone can trigger sexual desire in men, but sexual desire can also increase testosterone levels.
* Estrogen plays a role in female sexual desire and motivation, with increased estrogen levels during ovulation and menopause leading to increased sexual desire.

**Hormonal Causes of Reduced Sexual Motivation and Function in Men**

* Low testosterone levels can cause reduced sex drive, fatigue, reduced sexual function, shrinking testes, and infertility.
* Testosterone supplementation can treat low testosterone levels and increase sexual desire but comes with risks.

### 10.10 ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT INFLUENCES THE MOTIVATION FOR SEXUAL ACTIVITY

**Environmental Context and Sexual Activity**

* The environmental context significantly influences motivation for sexual activity.
* Cultural differences play a role in sexual behavior and attitudes towards it.

**Cultural Differences in Sexual Behavior**

* Frequency of sex varies by culture.
* Religious and moral ideas impact the type and timing of sexual behaviors.
* Changes in societal norms have led to more permissive attitudes towards premarital sex and hookups.

**Hookup Culture and Well-being**

* People in committed relationships have more frequent and emotionally beneficial sex than singles.
* Frequent sex is linked with greater well-being up to a point for people in intimate relationships.
* External stimuli, such as pornography, can influence motivation for sex and have unintended consequences.

**Inner Thoughts and External Stimuli**

* Sexual fantasies are common and acceptable, but not all external stimuli have positive effects.
* Men seek and view pornography more frequently than women, with varying impacts on relationships.
* Misconceptions about sexual anatomy can lead to unrealistic expectations and body image issues.

**Affirmative Consent**

* Explicit, informed, and voluntary agreement is necessary for healthy sexual environments.
* Adhering to affirmative consent reduces the chances of unwelcome or unwanted sexual advances.
* Alcohol consumption can make affirmative consent unreliable.

**Glossary**

* **Affirmative Consent**: Explicit, informed, and voluntary agreement to participate in a sex act.

### 10.11 INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES INFLUENCE THE MOTIVATION FOR SEXUAL ACTIVITY

**Paraphilias**:

* Unchanging sexual interest, arousal, or behavior not typically associated with sex.
* Not considered a disorder if consensual adults are involved and no distress is caused.
* **Paraphilias can be categorized into object-focused or act-focused**:
  * **Object-focused paraphilias**: 
    - fetishism (focus on nonsexual objects)
    - transvestism (dressing as a person of a different sex)
  * **Act-focused paraphilias**: 
    - exhibitionism (exposing one's naked body to others)
    - voyeurism (watching people disrobe or engage in sex)
    - frotteurism (rubbing against another person)
    - sexual sadism (being sexually aroused by causing suffering)
    - and sexual masochism (being aroused by being humiliated, beaten, bound, or made to suffer)
* **Pedophilia is a paraphilic disorder** due to its focus on prepubescent children, which is illegal and traumatizing for the child.

**Sexual Dysfunctions**:

* Enduring patterns of sexual problems causing distress and impairment in daily functioning.
* **Categorized by gender**: women's and men's difficulties with desire/arousal, orgasm, or pain, or problems caused by substances/medications.
* **Common sexual dysfunctions**:
  * **Women**: 
    - sexual interest/arousal disorder
    - female orgasmic disorder
    - genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder
    - substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction.
  * **Men**:
    - male hypoactive sexual desire disorder
    - erectile disorder
    - delayed ejaculation
    - premature ejaculation
    - substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction.
* Causes can be physical or psychological.
* Sexual dysfunctions may contribute to problematic thoughts, feelings, and actions.

### 11.2 OBESITY HAS MANY HEALTH CONSEQUENCES

**Obesity** is a major health problem with both physical and psychological consequences. It is defined as a level of excessive body fat that increases the risk for various health issues. There are several methods to determine obesity, including body weight, amount of body fat, and body shape. One commonly used measure is Body Mass Index (BMI), which compares an individual's weight to their height. However, BMI has limitations as it does not consider factors like age, sex, bone structure, or where the fat is stored.

**Consequences of Obesity**:

* Increased risk for various health problems such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer.
* Psychological issues like depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem due to societal stigma and negative perceptions.

**Determining Obesity**:

* **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: A widely used measure that compares an individual's weight to their height.
* **Other methods**: Body fat percentage, waist circumference, and body shape.

**Factors Contributing to Weight Gain**:

* Overeating due to the number or type of calories consumed.
* Lack of access to nutritous foods and reliance on inexpensive, highly processed, or fast foods.
* Availability of a variety of high-calorie foods leading to increased consumption.
* Large portions served in restaurants.
* Individual differences in response to food cues.

**Social Influences**:

* Friends' body weight may be contagious due to social norms and unstated agreements on acceptable body weight.
* Obesity tends to run in families, with genetics accounting for approximately half the variability in body weight.

**Genetic vs Environmental Factors**:

* Genetics determines whether a person can become obese but environment determines whether that person will become obese.
* Studies show that identical twins have similar body weights when overfed, indicating a genetic predisposition to obesity in environments that promote overfeeding.

**Stigma of Obesity**:

* Individuals with obesity are often viewed negatively in Western cultures, leading to psychological problems like depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.
* Fat shaming occurs frequently in social media and certain industries, further exacerbating the negative impact on individuals with obesity.

**Health Consequences and Stigmatization of Obesity**

- Fat shaming can lead to serious health consequences beyond hurt feelings.
- Negative beliefs about obesity are linked to poor health and mental health issues.

**Health Consequences of Stigmatization**:
- **Mental Health Problems**: associated with anxiety, perceived stress, substance abuse, and poor coping strategies (Papadopoulos & Brennan, 2015).
- **Decreased Life Expectancy**: due to avoidance of healthcare and negative attitudes from physicians (Sutin et al., 2015; Chrisler & Barney, 2017).

**Efforts to Destigmatize Obesity**:
- Positive media representation can help reduce shame and promote empathy (Aidy Bryant in Shrill).
- Not all cultures stigmatize obesity (desirable in some developing countries, Pacific Island nations).

**Dieting and Weight Loss**:
- Common belief that those with obesity are lazy or unmotivated.
- Restrictive dieting seldom leads to permanent weight loss due to body's natural defense against weight loss (set point determined by genetics).
- Dieting can result in a vicious cycle of weight loss and gain, slowing metabolism and making it easier to regain lost weight.

**Successful Weight Loss**:
- Permanent lifestyle changes are necessary for successful weight loss.
- Alter eating habits, increase exercise, deal with temptations, and enlist family support.
- Join support groups for additional help.

### 11.3 EXERCISE BENEFITS YOU PHYSICALLY, COGNITIVELY, AND EMOTIONALLY

**Physical Health**:
- Lowers risk for most types of cancer (Moore et al., 2016)
- Reduces heart problems (Arem et al., 2015)
- Increases longevity in middle age (Ladenvall et al., 2016)
- Improves cardiovascular health through temporarily increasing heart rate and breathing (Lavie et al., 2015)
- Reduces heart disease and cancer for weekend warriors who exercise only once or twice a week (O'Donovan et al., 2017)
- Increases life expectancy with the number of steps taken each day (Saint-Maurice et al., 2020)

**Cognitive Health**:
- Improves memory (Loprinzi et al., 2018)
- Enhances functioning in brain areas involved in memory formation (Stillman et al., 2020; Suwabe et al., 2018)
- Increases brain volume in sedentary adults between the ages of 60 and 79 (Colcombe et al., 2006)
- Improves overall cognition, including memory, in older adults with moderate memory problems (Lautenschlager et al., 2008)

**Emotional Health**:
- Boosts mood and self-confidence
- Helps cope with stress
- Affects neurotransmitter systems involved in reward, motivation, and emotion
- Promotes feelings of vigor and enhances mood (Crush et al., 2018)
- Contributes to positive outcomes for the treatment of depression (Schuch et al., 2016)
- Helps in the treatment of addiction and alcoholism (Read & Brown, 2003)

**Your friend Jerome might benefit from a brisk walk or run before studying because**:
- Exercise can improve cognitive abilities, including memory, which could help him better retain information during his exam preparation.
- Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural mood boosters that can help reduce stress and anxiety, making it easier for Jerome to focus on his studies.
- Regular exercise has been shown to contribute to positive outcomes in the treatment of depression, so a brisk walk or run could potentially help improve Jerome's overall mental wellbeing and motivation to study.

### 11.4 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS CAN BE PREVENTED BY PRACTICING SAFER SEX

**Health Effects of STIs**:
- Nearly 20 million new cases of STIs occur each year in the US, with about half of these infections being among people ages 15-24.
- STIs are generally transmitted through sexual contact, including vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, and oral-genital contact. Some STIs can also be spread through other means such as mother-to-child transmission or sharing needles.
- Common STIs include Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Herpes, HIV, HPV, Syphilis, Trichomoniasis, and others. Each STI has different symptoms, treatments, and potential long-term health effects.

**Ways to Practice Safer Sex**:
1. **Limit Exposure**: Abstaining from sex or limiting the number of sexual partners reduces the risk of contracting an STI.
2. **Get Information**: Regular STI testing, annual pelvic exams and PAP tests for women, and honest discussions with partners about sexual health are important in avoiding spreading or catching infection.
3. **Use Barrier Methods**: Male condoms, female condoms, and dental dams can help protect against STIs during sexual activity. Proper use of these methods is crucial.
4. **Prevention**: HPV vaccinations and other preventative measures can reduce the risk of contracting certain STIs and related cancers.

**Key Terms**:
- Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)
- Safer sex

**Table 11.1 Common Sexually Transmitted Infections**
| STI (and Number of New Cases in U.S. Each Year) | Type of Infection | Symptoms | Treatment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chlamydia (2,860,000) | Bacterial | 90% of people show no symptoms; thin, clear discharge from vagina or penis; irritation during urination. | Easily cured with antibiotics |
| Gonorrhea (820,000) | Bacterial | Sometimes no symptoms; painful urination; abnormal discharge from vagina or thick discharge (puslike) from the penis; swollen testicles. | Two different antibiotics at the same time |
| Herpes (776,000) | Viral | Burning or itching at site of infection; painful blisters that break and then crust over; fever and flulike symptoms; body aches and swollen glands. | No cure for the virus; infections can spread when blisters occur; antiviral drugs may relieve symptoms. |
| Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (41,400) | Viral (Retrovirus) | Often no initial symptoms; flulike symptoms; fatigue; weight loss; persistent headaches. Without treatment, HIV can progress to AIDS. | No cure for the virus; long-term treatment with multiple antiretroviral drugs controls HIV; without treatment, progression to AIDS is often fatal. |
| Human papillomavirus (HPV) (14,100,000) | Viral | Usually no symptoms; itchy genital warts; throat warts; various cancers. | Treat symptoms; vaccinations may provide protection. |
| Syphilis (55,400) | Bacterial | Painless, round sores around the genitals; skin rash and fever; large sores on other body parts. | Long-acting antibiotic |
| Trichomoniasis (1,090,000) | Parasite | Most people do not have symptoms; itching, burning, or unusual discharge in the genitals; pain during sexual activity. | Easily cured with drug therapy; all sexual partners must be treated. |

### 11.5 SMOKING IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH

* Millions of people around the world continue to smoke despite known health risks (Fiore et al., 2014)
* Smoking decreases life expectancy by more than 12 years for smokers (Jha et al., 2013)
* Tobacco causes approximately 8 million deaths annually worldwide (WHO, 2020c)
* Health problems include heart disease, respiratory ailments, and various cancers (Figure 11.11)
* Smoking also harms bystanders through secondhand smoke
* Smokers face social stigma, higher insurance premiums, and financial burden on smoking-related expenses

**Starting Smoking**

* Most smokers start in childhood or early adolescence (USDHHS, 2014)
* Social influences, such as friends and parents, play a significant role in adolescent smoking (Chassin et al., 1990; Figure 11.13)
* Nicotine addiction is the primary factor motivating and maintaining smoking behavior (Fagerstrom & Schneider, 1989; USDHHS, 2004)

**Vaping**

* Electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes have become increasingly popular as a nicotine delivery system (USDHHS, 2014)
* Approximately 3% of U.S. adults are regular vapers in 2019 (Creamer et al., 2019)
* E-cigarettes do not contain tobacco or the thousands of chemicals found in traditional cigarettes, but their long-term health effects on nonsmokers are unclear (Fagerstrom et al., 2015; Gotts et al., 2019)
* Adolescents and young adults are more likely to become regular cigarette smokers if they use e-cigarettes (Khouja et al., 2020; Primack et al., 2015; Wills et al., 2017)

**Quitting Smoking**

* Prescription medications, such as Chantix, can help reduce cravings and provide some of the desirable effects of smoking (Figure 11.15)
* Nicotine replacement methods, like nicotine patches, gum, or e-cigarettes with lower doses of nicotine, can assist in managing withdrawal symptoms
* Avoiding places where other people smoke and substituting healthier behaviors, such as chewing sugar-free gum, can also help quit smoking
* Around 90% of people who successfully quit do so on their own (Smith & Chapman, 2014)

**Main Reason Smokers Continue to Smoke**: Nicotine addiction is the primary factor motivating and maintaining smoking behavior. Once a smoker becomes addicted to nicotine, going without cigarettes will lead to unpleasant withdrawal symptoms, including distress and heightened anxiety (Russell, 1990). Nicotine leads to increased activation of dopamine neurons, which has a reinforcing effect and encourages further use.

### 11.6 THERE IS STRESS IN DAILY LIFE

* **Stressors**: Events in one's life that force adjustments and lead to stress. Psychologists categorize stressors into two types**: major life stressors and daily hassles.

**Major Life Stressors**:
- Unpredictable and uncontrollable catastrophic events that strain central areas of people's lives.
- Examples include natural disasters (e.g., wildfires, earthquakes), global pandemics, and personal choices leading to significant life changes (e.g., moving, having a baby, starting a new job).
- Can result from positive experiences as well.

**Daily Hassles**:
- Small, day-to-day irritations and annoyances that can have negative effects on health when their impacts accumulate.
- Examples include dealing with difficult people, heavy traffic, long lines, and managing finances.
- College students experience significant daily hassles related to academics and social life.

**Mediating Factors**:
- Personality and coping strategies that can increase or decrease the likelihood of a stress response to a stressor.

**Eustress**:
- Stress resulting from positive events, such as getting admitted to a desired college or preparing for a party.

**Distress**:
- Stress resulting from negative events, such as being late for an important meeting or helping a loved one deal with a serious illness.

The number of stressful events, whether positive or negative, predicts health outcomes. Some stressors cause more stress than others based on their life change unit scores.

### 11.7 YOU CAN HAVE SEVERAL RESPONSES TO STRESS

**Stress Responses**

* Stress is associated with negative health outcomes for various diseases, including cardiovascular disease, HIV/AIDS, asthma, and autoimmune disorders.
* People react to stressors in different ways, both physically and behaviorally.

**Physical Responses**

1. **General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS)**
   * A physical stress response described by Hans Selye.
   * **Consists of three stages**: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion.
      * **In the alarm stage**, immediate bodily responses boost physical abilities to fight or run away, but reduce other physical resources.
      * **In the resistance stage**, the body physically prepares for a longer attack against a stressor, increasing immunity to infection and disease.
      * **In the exhaustion stage**, the body's ability to respond to stress begins to decline, and various physiological systems fail, making the person more susceptible to diseases.
2. **Immune Response**
   * Stress alters the functions of the immune system.
   * Short-term stress boosts the immune system, while chronic stress weakens it, leaving the body less able to deal with infection.
3. **Fight-or-Flight Response**
   * A physical response to stressors that occurs during the alarm stage of GAS.
   * Prepares a person's body to fight or run away by directing energy towards dealing with the threat and reducing activities that make the organism vulnerable.

**Behavioral Responses**

- **Tend-and-Befriend Response (female response)**
   * Described by Shelley Taylor and colleagues as an alternative to the fight-or-flight response for females.
   * Females respond to stressors by protecting and caring for their offspring and forming social groups to reduce risks.

**Negative Stress Responses**

- **Stress Eating**
   * Eating in response to stressors, often overeating junk foods.
   * Can lead to obesity and other health problems.
- **Other Negative Behaviors**
   * Consuming alcohol, smoking cigarettes, using drugs, and quitting exercising as responses to stress.
   * Contribute to nearly every major cause of death in modern society.

**Explanation of why students might be more likely to get sick (stressed) at the end of a term**:

- **Immune system**: Our body's defense mechanism against invading microorganisms, including allergens, bacteria, and viruses.
- **General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS)**: A consistent pattern of physical responses to stress that consists of three stages: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion.
  * During the **alarm stage**, the body responds to a perceived threat by releasing stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline.
  * In the **resistance stage**, the body adapts to the stressor and maintains normal functioning.
  * However, during the **exhaustion stage**, prolonged stress can weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to illness.
- **Tend-and-befriend response**: Females' tendency to respond to stressors by protecting and caring for their offspring and forming social alliances.
- **Fight-or-flight response**: The physiological preparedness to deal with danger, which can lead to increased heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration.

**Mediating Factors and Their Impact on Stress**:

- Mediating factors are elements that influence how individuals cope with stressors.
- Examples of mediating factors include: jobs, school, family, relationships, money, time, pressure to succeed, pressure to conform, and pressure to be different.

**Heart Disease as a Stress-Related Condition**:

- **Definition**: Heart disease is a condition where the blood vessels around the heart become narrow or blocked by fatty plaque.
- **Consequences**: When pieces of plaque break off from the wall of a blood vessel, blood clots form and interrupt blood flow, leading to heart attacks or strokes.
- **Prevalence**: Heart disease is the leading cause of death for adults in the industrialized world, with more than 15 million people dying each year (Figure 11.22).
- **Gender Differences**: Although the rate of heart disease is lower in women than men, it remains the number-one killer of both genders.

**Genetics and Heart Disease**:

- Genetics plays a role in heart disease, but other factors like how individuals respond to stressors are also crucial.

**Personality and Coping Mechanisms**:

- Personality influences how individuals cope with stressors and can impact their risk of developing heart disease.
- Negative behaviors such as overeating and smoking increase the risk of heart disease, while healthy coping mechanisms decrease the risk.

### 11.8 PERSONALITY AND EMOTIONAL STATES INFLUENCE THE IMPACT OF STRESS ON HEART DISEASE

**Impact of Stress and Negative Emotions on Heart Disease**

* Stress and negative emotions increase the risk of heart disease in two ways (Albus, 2010; Sirois & Burg, 2003).
* People cope with stressors through unhealthy behaviors like overeating, alcohol overindulgence, or smoking.
* Chronic stress leads to wear and tear on the heart, making it more likely to fail.
* Stress causes overstimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to inflammation, higher blood pressure, blood vessel constriction, changes in blood chemistry, and plaque buildup on arteries.

**Type A and B Behavior Patterns**

* The Western Collaborative Group conducted a study (Rosenman et al., 1964) to examine the relationship between personality and heart disease.
* **Type A behavior pattern**: people who are competitive, achievement oriented, aggressive, hostile, restless, impatient, and time-pressed.
	+ More likely to develop heart disease than type B individuals.
	+ Early studies found that having a type A behavior pattern was as strong a predictor of heart disease as having high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or smoking.
* **Type B behavior pattern**: noncompetitive, relaxed, easygoing, and accommodating.
	+ Less adversely affected by stressors and less likely to develop heart disease.

**Hostile Personalities and Depression**

* Later studies questioned the association between type A behavior patterns and heart disease (Espnes & Byrne, 2016; Myrtek, 2001).
* Hostility is a more significant factor for women and men in predicting heart disease.
	+ Hot-tempered people who are frequently angry, cynical, and combative are at higher risk for heart disease.
	+ Having a high level of hostility while in college predicts greater risk for heart disease later in life.
* Depression also increases the risk of heart disease (Carney & Freedland, 2016).
	+ Being generally pessimistic, experiencing many negative emotions, and being insecure in social situations are predictive of heart disease.
* Negative personality traits can increase the risk of heart disease by causing physiological responses like increased heart rate, blood pressure, and muscle tension (Figure 11.23c).
	+ Chronic hostility and depression lead to wear and tear on the heart, making it more likely to fail.

### 11.9 COPING MEDIATES THE IMPACT OF STRESS

**Primary Appraisals**: In the primary appraisal process, individuals decide whether stimuli are stressful, benign, or irrelevant. This decision is based on their perception of the situation and its potential impact on them.

**Secondary Appraisals**: If stimuli are perceived as stressful, individuals use secondary appraisals to consider how to cope with the stressor. They evaluate their resources and options for managing the situation. These thoughts also influence perceptions of future potential stressors and reactions to them.

**Monitoring**: Monitoring is an essential aspect of coping with academic stress. It involves self-regulated learning, recognizing effective coping strategies, and avoiding emotion-focused coping such as procrastination or avoidance. Instead, problem-focused coping strategies like using study resources and working effectively should be employed.

**Types of Coping**: 
* **Emotion-focused coping**: In this type, individuals try to prevent an emotional response to the stressor by adopting strategies like avoidance, minimizing the problem, distancing themselves from outcomes, or engaging in behaviors such as eating or drinking. These strategies do not solve the problem but can help manage emotions in the short term.
* **Problem-focused coping**: In this type, individuals take direct steps to address the stressor by generating alternative solutions, weighing their costs and benefits, and choosing among them. This approach is effective in the long run if the situation is controllable and moderate levels of stress are present.

**Downward Comparison**: A coping strategy that involves focusing on the fact that others have it worse than you to help put your situation into perspective and reduce feelings of stress.

**Individual Differences in Coping**: People differ in their ability to cope with stressors, and some are more resilient than others. Hardiness is a trait characterized by commitment, challenge, and control that helps individuals adapt to life changes constructively. Resilience refers to the ability to cope effectively with adversity and bounce back quickly from setbacks or negative experiences.

#### USING PSYCHOLOGY IN YOUR LIFE  
Exam anxiety is a common experience of stress during academic assessments, which can negatively impact performance. The three components of stress include the stressor (exam), physical response, and emotional and cognitive responses. To cope with exam anxiety, consider the following strategies:

1. **Change how you think about the exam**:
   * Avoid negative thinking and use positive reappraisal to view the exam as a challenge that can be met successfully.
2. **Prepare physically**:
   * Get plenty of sleep the night before the exam.
   * Avoid unhealthy behaviors, such as drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes.
3. **Arrive early and relax**:
   * Reach the exam room several minutes early to allow your body time to recover from the stress response.
   * Practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, before entering the exam room.
4. **Use good test-taking skills**:
   * Underline important parts of questions and cross out incorrect answers.
   * Take time to check all answers and reconsider uncertain ones after completing the exam.

**Impact: Practicing**

* **Practice makes less scary**: Repeated practice can help reduce worries about tests and improve performance.
* **Relax before practice tests**: Training yourself to relax before tests can enhance your exam experience.
* **Notice question wording**: Understanding how questions are phrased on practice tests can lead to higher grades on actual exams.

**Learning Goal Check: Review & Apply**

**Question**: Why getting to the exam room early helps reduce exam anxiety?
*Answer*: Arriving early allows your body time to recover from the stress response, which includes a rapid heart rate and increased breathing. This gives you a better chance of entering the exam room calm and focused.

**Question**: Can a positive attitude keep you healthy?
*Answer*: Yes, research suggests that positive emotions and experiences can have beneficial effects on health and well-being. Positive emotions may help strengthen the immune system, reduce stress, and improve overall mental and physical health.

### 11.11 POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY EMPHASIZES WELL-BEING

**Positive Psychology** is a branch of psychology that focuses on the positive aspects of human experience, including happiness and well-being. In the 1990s, this field emerged as a response to the predominant focus on mental illness in psychology.

Research shows that happy people have better health outcomes across various measures, such as heart disease, cancer, HIV, and diabetes (Pressman et al., 2019). Happiness is composed of three components:

1. Positive emotion and pleasure
2. Engagement in life
3. Living a meaningful life

**Well-being**: More recently, positive psychology has placed greater emphasis on overall well-being, which goes beyond just happiness. Well-being includes good relationships, a history of accomplishment, and a sense of purpose (Seligman, 2011).

**A Sense of Well-Being**: To achieve well-being, individuals need to strive for optimal health and life satisfaction by actively participating in health-enhancing behaviors. Small acts, such as smiling or expressing gratitude, can increase positive emotions and happiness (Emmons & McCullough, 2003; Sheldon & Lyubomirsky, 2006).

**Cultural Differences**: 
Well-being tends to vary across cultures. The wealthiest countries often have the highest levels of satisfaction, with Finland and Helsinki reporting the highest sense of well-being in the world (De Neve & Krekel, 2020). 

In the United States, Gallup's Well-Being Index surveys well-being across five areas: 
- career
- social relations
- financial security
- safety
- health
 
Hawaii reported the highest well-being, while West Virginia reported the lowest (Witters, 2019).

**Mindfulness**: Mindfulness is a state of mind that involves paying attention to the present moment. Practicing mindfulness can help increase happiness, reduce anxiety, and improve engagement in life (Bamber & Kraenzle Schneider, 2016; Brown & Ryan, 2003; Kabat-Zinn, 1994).

**Living a Purposeful and Meaningful Life**: Finding meaning in life is an essential aspect of developing more meaning and living optimally. People who believe their lives are meaningful or have purpose report greater happiness, less depression and anxiety, and enhanced overall well-being (Baumeister & Vohs, 2002; Emmons, 2003).

**Health Benefits of Positivity and Well-Being**: Research shows that positive emotions and well-being are linked with good health (Figure 11.28). Higher levels of hope and curiosity have been associated with reduced risk of various diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and respiratory tract infections (Richman et al., 2005). Happy people have stronger immune systems and live longer than their less positive peers (Dockray & Steptoe, 2010; Xu & Roberts, 2010; Cohen et al., 2006).

**Three Things Britney Could Do to Increase Her Well-Being**:

1. **Practice mindfulness**: Encourage Britney to focus on the present moment and engage in activities that help her be more aware of her surroundings and thoughts.
2. **Identify her unique purpose**: Help Britney reflect on what gives her life meaning and how she can connect with that purpose through her goals, relationships, or experiences.
3. **Engage in health-enhancing behaviors**: Encourage Britney to prioritize self-care, such as eating well, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and practicing stress management techniques like deep breathing or meditation.

### 11.12 SOCIAL SUPPORT IS ASSOCIATED WITH GOOD HEALTH

**Social Support and Health**

* Social interaction is beneficial for physical and mental health (Slavich, 2020)
* People with larger social networks are less likely to catch colds and live longer (Cohen et al., 1997; Berkman & Syme, 1979)
* Lack of social support leads to depression, psychological problems, physical illness, and mortality (Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2010; Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015)

**Two Ways Social Support Reduces Stress**

* **Less overall stress:** People with social support experience less stress due to tangible help and emotional support. For example:
  * Single parents juggling job and family responsibilities
  * Lack of a partner means more tasks and fewer emotional resources
* **Better coping with stressors:** Social support helps people cope with stressors by offering expressions of caring and willingness to listen to problems, lessening the negative effects. For example:
  * Married individuals experience numerous physical and mental health benefits (Study Unit 4.13)
  * Expressing gratitude strengthens relationships and provides a valuable resource during stressful times

**Gratitude**

* Gratitude is a positive emotion that occurs when we are thankful to others for benefits received
* Practicing gratitude increases well-being, happiness, optimism, and reduces anxiety and lower blood pressure (Emmons & McCullough, 2003; Ginty et al., 2020; Jans-Beken et al., 2019; Schache et al., 2019)
* Expressing gratitude can be through communication or simply listing things for which you are grateful
* Gratitude strengthens relationships and provides a valuable resource during stressful times

**Spirituality**

* Religion or spirituality provides a sense of meaning, purpose, and connection to something bigger than oneself (Pargament & Mahoney, 2009)
* Religious people report greater feelings of well-being due to:
  * Prayers of gratitude
  * Coping skills provided by religious beliefs
  * Social support from faith communities
* Spirituality can have positive effects on well-being regardless of religion (Figure 11.30)
* Religion and spirituality provide a sense of belonging and connection to others through shared values and beliefs

### 11.13 SEVERAL STRATEGIES CAN HELP YOU STAY HEALTHY

**Strategies for Healthy Living**

* Psychologists have identified several strategies to help cope with stress, regulate emotions, and control daily habits for better health and well-being.

**Eating Habits**:

* **Eat a varied diet that emphasizes natural foods**: whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean animal products.
* Avoid processed foods, fast food, added sugars, trans fat, and artificial types of fat.
* Watch portion sizes to prevent overeating and obesity.

**Drinking**:

* Drink alcohol in moderation or avoid it altogether. One glass of wine per day may have cardiovascular benefits but excessive consumption can lead to health problems.

**Physical Activity**:

* Engage in moderate physical activity for at least 30 minutes, four times a week.
* Find ways to be active throughout the day, such as taking stairs or walking to work/school.

**Smoking**:

* Avoid smoking to prevent health problems like coughing, unpleasant odor, bad breath, cancers, lung disease, and premature death.

**Sexual Health**:

* Practice safer sex by using barrier protection methods or abstinence to avoid sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

**Relaxation**:

* Learn relaxation techniques such as yoga to soothe the body and mind.
* Seek help from trained counselors for stress management.

**Coping Strategies**:

* Assess negative events realistically, find positive aspects, and use strategies like seeking advice, attempting new solutions, distraction, and humor to deal with stressors.

**Support Network**:

* Build a strong support network of friends and family who share your values and can provide assistance, encouragement, and understanding.

**Spiritual Life**:

* Incorporate spiritual beliefs into daily living for a meaningful life and positive health outcomes.

**Happiness Exercises**:

* Engage in low-risk activities like writing gratitude letters or practicing positive thinking to increase happiness.

## 12 SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY

**Social Psychology:** The branch of psychology that explores how people influence each other's thoughts, feelings, and actions. It focuses on understanding human relationships and interactions in social contexts.

**Big Questions**:
- How do you think about other people?
- How do your attitudes affect you?
- How do other people influence you?
- How can you develop strong relationships?

**Background**:
- Sam Slaven, an Iraqi war veteran, joined the army in 2003 and was sent to Iraq.
- Two of his fellow soldiers were killed in an ambush, leading him to feel betrayed by the locals and develop hatred towards Muslims.
- After returning to the United States, he began taking classes at Parkland College in Illinois, where he realized he needed to change his perspective on Muslims.
- Sam attended a meeting of the Muslim Student Association and formed a warm friendship with its founder, Yousif Radiff.
- Together, they organized a 5K run to counter negative perceptions of Islam.

**Social Influence:** The way individuals' thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are affected by the presence of others or their actions.

**Snap Judgments:** Quick assessments or opinions formed about someone based on limited information, often influenced by nonverbal cues.

**Nonverbal Cues:** Information conveyed through body language, facial expressions, tone of voice, and other means that can influence social judgments.

**Verbal and Nonverbal Cues:** Both verbal (words, tone of voice) and nonverbal (body language, facial expressions) cues provide valuable information for forming impressions of others.

* **Facial Expressions:** A powerful nonverbal cue that communicates emotional state, interest, and trustworthiness. Eye contact is an essential part of facial expressions in Western cultures but may be considered disrespectful in other cultures.
* **Eye Contact:** An important aspect of facial expressions that can indicate emotions, attention, or deception. Cultural norms influence the significance of eye contact.

**Thin Slices of Behavior:** Accurate judgments can be made based on brief observations of someone's behavior. Nonverbal cues from faces, voices, and body language provide valuable information for forming impressions.

### 12.2 YOU MAKE ATTRIBUTIONS ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE

**Attributions**: Explanations for why events or actions occur

**Types of Attributions**

* **Dispositional Attributions**: Explanations based on people's internal characteristics, such as abilities, traits, moods, or efforts
* **Situational Attributions**: Explanations based on external factors, such as the weather, luck, accidents, or other people's actions
* **Bernard Weiner (1974, 2018) identified other dimensions of attributions**: stable vs. unstable, controllable vs. uncontrollable

**Bias in Attributions**

* People tend to overemphasize personality traits and underestimate situations when explaining other people's behavior (fundamental attribution error)
* When explaining our own behavior, we tend to focus on situations rather than personality traits (actor/observer bias)

**Actor/Observer Bias**

* **When you are the actor** in a situation, your interpretation of a behavior or outcome is based on the situation
* **When you are the observer**, you interpret the same behavior or outcome based on others' personality traits

**Reason for this difference**: You know more about the situations that you are involved in

**Fundamental Attribution Error**

* Tendency to overemphasize personality traits and underestimate situations when explaining other people's behavior
* Simplistic and often wrong, but appealing because it makes the world seem safer and saner

**Learning Tip**

* **When a friend gets into a car crash**: dispositional attribution (they are a careless driver)
* **If you crash your car**: situational attribution (the road was slippery)

### 12.3 YOU TEND TO STEREOTYPE OTHER PEOPLE

**Stereotyping**: Why We Do It and Its Effects on People

**Stereotypes**:
- Mental shortcuts for processing social information (Figure 12.3)
- Automatic, outside of awareness
- Neutral in themselves but can lead to biased perceptions and actions

**Effects of Stereotypes**:

**On Perception**:
- Influence basic perceptual processes (Hughes et al., 2019)
- Unconscious bias leading to misidentifications (Payne, 2001; Figure 12.4a and b)
- Negative outcomes, such as incorrect assumptions and potential harm (Colgate University incident)

**Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**:
- People behave in ways that confirm expectations, whether their own or others'
- Robert Rosenthal and Lenore Jacobson's research on labeling students as "bloomers" (Rosenthal & Jacobson, 1968)
- Negative stereotypes can also become self-fulfilling (McKown & Weinstein, 2008)

**Stereotype Threat**:
- Fear or worry about confirming negative stereotypes related to a person's own group
- Can lead to poor performance on tests and academic underachievement (Steele & Aronson, 1995; Figure 12.5)
- Interventions, such as informing people about the negative consequences of stereotype threat or encouraging positive self-affirmation, can help mitigate its effects (Johns et al., 2005; Cohen, 2006; Baydala et al., 2009)

**Impact on Steve**:
Stereotype threat might interfere with Steve's performance on a test of memory due to the presence of younger participants, potentially making him feel that his age is a disadvantage and negatively affecting his confidence and motivation.

### 12.4 STEREOTYPES CAN LEAD TO PREJUDICE AND DISCRIMINATION

**Negative Consequences of Stereotypes**:
1. **Prejudice**: Negative feelings, opinions, and beliefs associated with a stereotype about people in a particular group.
2. **Discrimination**: Inappropriate and unjustified treatment of people based on the groups they belong to.
3. Prejudice and discrimination are responsible for much conflict and warfare around the world.
4. People tend to identify strongly with their ingroups and discriminate against outgroups.

**Social Identity Theory**:
1. According to social identity theory, group memberships contribute to self-esteem and sense of belonging.
2. Humans differentiate between ingroups (those we belong to) and outgroups (those we do not belong to) from early development.
3. **Ingroup favoritism**: treating ingroup members more favorably than outgroup members, even when groups are formed randomly.
4. This behavior may have evolved as a survival mechanism for group cooperation and resource protection.

**Ways to Reduce Prejudice and Discrimination**:
1. **Cooperation**: Encouraging intergroup cooperation can reduce animosity and increase tolerance and friendship.
2. **Jigsaw Classroom**: A program where students work together in mixed-race or mixed-sex groups, leading to more positive treatment of other ethnicities.
3. **Perspective Taking**: Thinking about the psychological experiences of other people can reduce bias and improve interactions with outgroup members.
4. Other successful strategies include contact hypothesis (intergroup contact under positive conditions), education, and media representation.

**Understanding Your Feelings and Beliefs**:
1. Our feelings and beliefs are shaped by social context and influence our daily life.
2. Understanding these attitudes is essential for personal growth and effective interpersonal relationships.

### 12.5 YOU FORM ATTITUDES THROUGH EXPERIENCE AND SOCIALIZATION

**Attitudes**: Feeling and beliefs about objects, events, and ideas that influence behavior. Behavior can also affect attitudes. Attitudes can be simple (behavior matches attitude) or complex (behavior does not match attitude).

**Three Ways Attitudes Develop**:

1. **Mere Exposure Effect**: The more you are exposed to something, the more you tend to like it due to familiarity. This effect also applies to faces and can be used by advertisers to condition positive attitudes toward products.
2. **Learning**: Attitudes can be conditioned through classical or operant conditioning. For example, seeing a celebrity paired with a product can lead to positive attitudes toward the product (classical conditioning), while being rewarded for performing an action can lead to more positive attitudes toward that action (operant conditioning).
3. **Socialization**: Observing and modeling other people's attitudes is another way attitudes develop. Caregivers, peers, teachers, religious leaders, politicians, and media figures can influence attitudes about many things.

**Explicit vs. Implicit Attitudes**:

* **Explicit Attitude**: Consciously aware of and able to report an attitude.
* **Implicit Attitude**: Influences feelings and behaviors at an unconscious level and is often revealed indirectly through behavior. Accessed from memory quickly with little conscious effort or control.

**Attitudes Predict Behavior**: The stronger and more personally relevant an attitude, the more likely it is to predict behavior. Specific attitudes are more predictive than general beliefs. Attitudes formed through direct experience are better predictors of behavior.

**Attitude Accessibility**: Ease or difficulty of retrieving an attitude from memory. The accessibility of an attitude predicts how consistent with the attitude a behavior is likely to be. Easily activated attitudes are more stable, predictive of behavior, and resistant to change.

### 12.6 DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOR LEAD TO DISSONANCE

**Cognitive Dissonance Theory**

* Theory proposed by Leon Festinger in 1957 to explain what happens when people hold conflicting attitudes or when an attitude contradicts a behavior
* Occurs when there is a lack of agreement or inconsistency between two attitudes or between an attitude and a behavior
* Results in anxiety, tension, and displeasure that motivates individuals to reduce the dissonance by changing their attitudes or behaviors

**Components of Cognative Dissonance**

* **Inter-attitudinal dissonance**: when two attitudes contradict each other (e.g., smoking despite knowing it's harmful)
* **Intra-attitudinal dissonance**: when an attitude contradicts a behavior (e.g., deciding between two majors, choosing one and focusing on its positive aspects)
* **Postdecisional dissonance**: occurs after making a decision and focuses on justifying the chosen option

**Justification of Effort**

* People may change their attitudes to justify the effort they put into an experience or commitment (e.g., lying about enjoying a boring task to receive payment)
* The more significant the effort, the stronger the justification needed to reduce dissonance
* Can lead individuals to exaggerate the importance of a group or commitment (e.g., joining cults or following charismatic leaders)

**Impact of Cognitive Dissonance**

* Can result in dangerous behaviors, such as hazing and initiation rites on college campuses, which can lead to tragic consequences
* Administrators impose rules and penalties to discourage these practices, but some groups continue to engage in them due to the justification of effort and the perceived value of group membership.

### 12.7 YOUR ATTITUDES CAN BE CHANGED THROUGH PERSUASION

**Learning Goal**: Explain how persuasion changes attitudes and the factors that influence its effectiveness.

**Persuasion**:
- Active and conscious effort to change an attitude by sending a message (Hovland et al., 1953)
- Most effective when you pay attention, understand, find it convincing, and remember it

**Factors Affecting Persuasiveness**:

- **Source**:
  - Attractive and credible sources are persuasive (Petty & Wegener, 1998)
  - Similarity to self or alignment with personal values increases credibility (Albarracin & Shavitt, 2018)
- **Content**:
  - Strong emotional appeals and arguments are persuasive (Greenwald, 1968)
  - Mere exposure effect: repetition of message to increase persuasion (Petty & Wegener, 1998)
  - One-sided vs. balanced arguments: one-sided works better with sympathetic or gullible audiences; balanced arguments are more persuasive with skeptical crowds (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986)

**Two Routes of Persuasion**:

- **Central Route**:
  - High elaboration: pay attention to arguments and consider all information (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986)
  - Results in strong attitudes that last over time and actively defended
- ***Peripheral Route**:
  - Low elaboration: minimal processing of message (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986)
  - Influenced by cues such as attractiveness or status of the person making the argument (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986)
  - Results in weaker attitudes that are more likely to change over time

**Example**: Steward's decision to buy a cereal based on nutrition label = central route (high elaboration)

**How Do Other People Influence You?**
- Your behavior changes depending on the people you are with or the situation
- Factors such as social norms, conformity, and obedience can influence your attitudes and actions.

### 12.8 GROUPS AFFECT YOUR BEHAVIOR

Groups play a significant role in shaping behavior and motivation

**Four main ways groups affect people**:
* **Social Facilitation**: Presence of others improves performance, especially for easy or well-learned tasks (Norman Triplett's experiment)
  * **Social loafing**: Presence of others impairs performance when efforts are pooled and individuals do not feel personally responsible for the group's output
* **Deindividuation**: Loss of individuality and self-awareness in a group, leading to reduced attention to personal standards and inhibitions
  * **Group Decision Making**: Groups can make riskier decisions than individuals (risky shift effect) or become more cautious (group polarization)

**Group Work for Deep Learning**

* Assign specific tasks to each member for a deeper understanding of the material
* Participate actively in group discussions
* Share examples and explain concepts to group members

**Social Facilitation**

* Improves performance for easy or well-learned tasks (Figure 12.15a)
* Occurs due to increased arousal, attention, and social comparison

**Social Loafing**

* Decreased individual effort in a group setting (Figure 12.15b)
* Can be minimized by making individuals feel personally responsible for the group's output

**Deindividuation**

* Reduced self-awareness and attention to personal standards (Figure 12.16a)
* Leads to actions that people would not take when alone or self-aware
* Can be caused by excitement, anonymity, and lack of clear responsibility

**Group Decision Making**

* Groups can make riskier decisions than individuals (risky shift effect) or become more cautious (group polarization) (Figure 12.17)
* **Groupthink**: Extreme form of group polarization characterized by a lack of critical thinking and consideration of alternative viewpoints
* **Prevention**: Encourage expression of alternative ideas, respectful communication, and careful examination of outside opinions

### 12.9 YOU CONFORM TO AND COMPLY WITH OTHERS

**Conformity**:

* Act of altering behaviors or opinions to match others or expectations (Figure 12.18)
* Powerful form of social influence
* **Two primary reasons for conformity**: normative and informational influences

**Normative Influence**:

* Conformity due to the desire to be liked, accepted, or avoid looking foolish
* **Example**: Facing doors in an elevator (Figure 12.18a)
* Social norms influence behavior by indicating appropriate conduct and how people will respond to violations
* People conform due to normative influence in daily life (e.g., adolescents, jury members, standing in line)
* Small group size and lack of unanimity among the group can decrease our tendency to conform

**Informational Influence**:

* Conformity due to the assumption that group behavior provides information about the right way to act
* **Example**: Running with a crowd during an emergency (Figure 12.18b)
* Asch's study on visual acuity and conformity

**Social Norms**:

* Expected standards of conduct that influence behavior
* Indicate which behavior is appropriate in a given situation and how people will respond to violations
* People tend to feel embarrassed when they break social norms

**Compliance**:

* Agreeing to do things requested by others
* **Factors increasing compliance**: good mood, foot-in-the-door strategy, door-in-the-face strategy, lowballing strategy (Table 12.1)

**Application**:

* Richard joins his friends to watch the NFL Super Bowl despite not being a big football fan. This behavior represents normative influence as he conforms to the social norm of watching the Super Bowl with friends to be accepted and avoid looking foolish.

### 12.10 YOU PROBABLY OBEY PEOPLE WHO HAVE AUTHORITY

**Milgram's Interest in Obedience**

* Milgram conducted experiments in the early 1960s to understand why apparently normal German citizens obeyed orders to harm innocent people during World War II.
* He was interested in the determinants of obedience, or what factors influence people to follow orders given by an authority figure.

**Milgram's Experiment on Obedience: Overview**

* Participant ("teacher") administered shocks to a "learner" (confederate) whenever they answered incorrectly in another room.
* Teachers heard recordings of the learner screaming and begging for the experiment to stop.
* Experimenter insisted that teachers continue, using phrases like "The experiment requires that you continue."

**Hypothesis: People Will Obey Authority Figures**

1. Participant ("teacher") believed they had to administer shocks to the learner whenever they answered incorrectly.
2. Learner was secretly working with the experimenter as a confederate.
3. Teachers were introduced to the learner after the experiment to see that they were unharmed.

**Results: Obedience to Authority**

* Almost all participants tried to quit, but nearly two-thirds obeyed the experimenter's directives to continue delivering shocks.
* People are more likely to obey when they believe their actions have been sanctioned by a legitimate authority figure.

**Factors Affecting Obedience**

1. **Personality**: Some people, particularly those concerned about how others view them, are more obedient.
2. **Situational Factors**: Obedience decreases when the teacher can see or touch the learner and when the experimenter gives orders over the telephone.

**Criticisms of Milgram's Research**

* Some participants received stronger orders than others.
* Participants may not have believed the victim was receiving a life-threatening shock.
* Participants might have followed orders because they identified with the goals of science.
* **Ethical concerns**: Not all participants received timely debriefings about the true nature of the experiments.

**Norman and Eddie's Situation**

* Norman, who is worried about his boss's opinion, is more likely to obey the order.
* Eddie, who receives a text from his supervisor, might also obey but less willingly due to the indirect nature of the communication.

### 12.11 YOU MAY HURT OR HELP OTHER PEOPLE

**Factors Affecting Aggression:**

* **Biology:**
  * Aggression in animals: mating, territory defense.
  * Brain regions and chemistry (serotonin) linked to aggression.
  * Low serotonin levels associated with aggression in humans.

* **Situation:**
  * Frustration leads to aggression (frustration-aggression hypothesis).
  * Negative emotions can trigger physical aggression.
  * Temperature and violent crime rates.

**Factors Affecting Prosocial Behavior:**

* **Human Evolution:**
  * Aggression varies across cultures and times.
  * Society and culture influence tendencies to commit acts of violence.

* **Prosocial Behavior and Altruism:**
  * Prosocial behaviors benefit others.
  * Group living requires prosocial behaviors for survival.
  * Altruism: helping with no apparent reward, often toward relatives.
  * Reciprocal helping: helping in expectation of future help.

**Bystander Effect:**

* A person in need is less likely to be offered help when other bystanders are present. (Latané & Darley, 1968)
* Misconception: 38 people witnessed Kitty Genovese's murder, but few were in a position to help or call the police.

**Experiments on Bystander Effect**

- Latané and Darley conducted experiments using various scenarios:
  * Smoke filling a room (Figure 12.25)
  * Mock crimes, heart attacks, and public emergencies
- Results showed that the presence of other bystanders decreased the likelihood of help being offered

**Factors Influencing Helping Behavior**

- Four major reasons for bystander effect:
  1. Expectation that others will help
  2. Fear of making social blunders in ambiguous situations
  3. Anonymity and the desire to avoid personal risk or forgoing benefits
  4. Weighing personal harm and potential benefits


### 12.12 SITUATIONS AND PERSONALITIES AFFECT YOUR RELATIONSHIPS

**Relationships**

- Importance of nonfamily relationships: romantic partners, friends
- Scientific exploration of love and friendship (Berscheid & Regan, 2005)
- Factors leading to strong, lasting relationships:
  * Choosing the right people
  * Core social bonds development
  * Successes and failures

**Factors Influencing Relationship Development**

* Four key factors that promote the development of friendships and romantic relationships
* Proximity, similarity, admirable personal characteristics, and physical attractiveness

**Proximity**

* The more often people come into contact, the more likely they are to become friends (Festinger, Schachter, & Back, 1950)
* Friendships form among people who belong to the same groups or clubs
* Proximity may lead to familiarity and the mere exposure effect

**Similarity**

* Birds of a feather flock together (Youyou et al., 2017)
* People with similar attitudes, values, interests, backgrounds, personalities, and levels of attractiveness tend to like each other more
* High school friendships based on sex, race, ethnicity, age, and year in school
* Successful romantic couples also tend to be physically similar (Bentler & Newcomb, 1978; Caspi & Herbener, 1990)
* People can become friends or romantic partners with those of other races, ages, etc., based on other important similarities

**Admirable Personal Characteristics**

* People tend to like those who have valuable personality traits (Anderson, 1968)
* Kindness, dependability, and trustworthiness are desirable traits
* Overly competent or perfect people can make others feel uncomfortable or inadequate
* Small mistakes can make a person seem more human and likable

**Physical Attractiveness**

* People value physical attractiveness in forming relationships
* Standards of beauty change over time and across cultures, but general preferences remain consistent (Cunningham et al., 1995)
* Good hygiene and symmetry are attractive qualities
* Attractive people receive numerous social benefits, including being perceived as happier, more intelligent, more sociable, etc. (Feingold, 1992)
* Preference for attractiveness begins early in life (Rubenstein et al., 1999; Langlois et al., 1995)
* Attractive people are not necessarily smarter or happier (Feingold, 1992)

**Why Opposites Do Not Attract in Terms of Relationships**

* Similarity is a key factor in relationship development
* People tend to be attracted to those who share their values, beliefs, interests, etc.
* Opposites may initially attract due to novelty or excitement, but the differences can lead to conflict and misunderstandings over time
* Long-term relationships require compatibility and shared values for success.

### 12.13 LOVE IS A KEY PART OF ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS

**Background**:
- People have always been curious about the nature of love.
- Ellen Berscheid and Elaine Hatfield's research on love using scientific methods (1969).
- Most people hope to find someone they love at some point in their lives.

**Love: Passionate vs Companionate**
1. **Passionate Love**:
   - Intense longing and sexual desire.
   - Associated with activity in dopamine reward systems (Figure 12.27a).
   - Early stage of relationships, evolves into companionate love.
2. **Companionate Love**:
   - Strong commitment to caring for and supporting a partner.
   - Based on friendship, trust, respect, and intimacy (Figure 12.27b).
   - Develops slowly over time.

**Changes in Love Over Time**
- Romantic relationships change as the long-term pattern of sexual activity rises and then declines.
- Frequency of sex decreases after the peak, leading to dissatisfaction if no other forms of satisfaction are present.
- Many marriages fail due to loss of passion and lack of other forms of satisfaction.

**Staying in Love**
1. **Positive Interactions**:
   - Show interest in your partner.
   - Be affectionate.
   - Show you care.
2. **Exploring Joint Interests**:
   - Find time to explore hobbies or other activities together.
3. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Express concern for each other during disagreements.
   - Stay relatively calm and try to see each other's point of view.
4. **Attributional Style**:
   - Happy couples attribute good outcomes to their partners, while unhappy couples attribute bad outcomes to their partners.
5. **Idealization**:
   - Viewing your partner in a positive light may help maintain the relationship.

## 13 SELF AND PERSONALITY

This chapter discusses various aspects of self and personality, including how individuals perceive themselves, what personality is, how it's assessed, and its relationship with biology.

**Millennials and Gen Z Personalities**

- Millennials (born roughly from the early 1980s to mid-1990s) are politically aware, socially just, and less interested in money than previous generations.
- Gen Z (born after 1995) are digital natives, prefer independent work, and spend more time multitasking.
- Social forces can shape people's characteristics, but biology also plays a role in personality development.

**How Do You Know Yourself?**

Self-concept is the collection of everything you think, believe, and feel about yourself. It includes your memories, experiences, personal characteristics, and physical appearance.

- **Self-schema**: An integrated set of memories, beliefs, and generalizations about yourself that helps you quickly perceive, organize, interpret, and use information about yourself.
- **Working self-concept**: The immediate experience of the self in the here and now, which varies depending on the situation and influences behavior.

**Self-Concept, Self-Schema, and Working Self-Concept**

*Your Self-Concept Is What You Know and Believe About Yourself*

- Self-concept includes your memories, experiences, personal characteristics, and physical appearance.
- It helps you feel like you are the same person over time and influences your thoughts, behaviors, and feelings.

*Your Self-Schema: An Integrated Set of Memories, Beliefs, and Generalizations About Yourself*

- Organized as a network of interconnected knowledge about yourself.
- Helps you quickly perceive, organize, interpret, and use information about yourself.
- Increases your memory for information that is relevant to you.

*Working Self-Concept Shows That Your Sense of Self Can Vary*

- The immediate experience of the self in the here and now.
- Limited to the amount of personal information being processed at one moment in time.
- Influences behavior based on the situation and role in that situation.

### 13.2 PEOPLE DIFFER IN HOW THEY VALUE THEMSELVES

**Self-Esteem**

* Evaluative aspect of self-concept indicating how individuals value or feel about themselves
* Indicates whether one views oneself as worthy or unworthy, leading to positive or negative feelings towards oneself
* Can be influenced by objective indicators but not necessarily reflective of them
* May vary over the course of one's life, with low points in late teens and early 20s, especially for women, and toward the end of life

**Causes of Self-Esteem**

* Based on reflected appraisal or how individuals believe others perceive them
* Internalization of values and beliefs expressed by important people in their lives
* Objectively believing positive things about oneself but not liking oneself (low self-esteem) or vice versa (high self-esteem)
* Self-esteem tends to be lowest during adolescence, especially for young women aged 18-22
* Recent research suggests treating oneself with compassion during difficult times can improve mental health and life satisfaction

**Consequences of Self-Esteem**

* High self-esteem may not necessarily lead to successful social relationships or life outcomes
* People with high self-esteem may be more likely to become violent when they feel disrespected
* Narcissism, a characteristic associated with inflated self-esteem, is part of the dark triad of negative personality traits
* Dark triad traits (narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism) are associated with career success but also negatively impact relationships and morality

**Self-Compassion**

* Treating oneself with care, acceptance, and kindness during difficult times
* Recent research suggests self-compassion can lead to greater life satisfaction and fewer feelings of depression
* Can improve mental health during the first year of college

**Dark Triad**

* Three negative personality traits: narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism
* Lack of empathy, willingness to be dishonest, and low level of agreeableness unite these traits
* Possession of dark triad traits is associated with career success but negatively impacts relationships and morality
* Some individuals may have personality disorders due to extreme levels of narcissism or psychopathy
* **Narcissism**: excessive self-centeredness, grandiosity, and entitlement.
* **Psychopathy**: a general lack of caring for the welfare of others, callousness, cunning, impulsivity, and recklessness.
* **Machiavellianism**: manipulating others for one's own gain and lacking conventional morality.

### 13.3 YOU TRY TO CREATE A POSITIVE SENSE OF SELF

**13.3 Creating a Positive Sense of Self**

People generally aim to maintain positive views of themselves, leading to various biases and strategies that help build and sustain a positive self-image. These include:

**Positive Illusions About the Sense of Self**

1. **Better-than-average effect**: Most people believe they are above average in various aspects.
2. **Unrealistic control beliefs**: People overestimate their ability to control events and outcomes.
3. **Unrealistic optimism about personal future**: Overestimation of future success and happiness.

**Social Comparisons**

1. **Downward comparison**: Comparing oneself with someone perceived as less competent or in a worse situation, which can increase self-esteem.
2. **Upward comparison**: Comparing oneself with someone perceived as more competent or in a better situation, which can decrease self-esteem.
3. **Temporal comparison**: Comparing the current version of oneself with a previous version, which can increase self-esteem when viewing the present self as improved.

**The Self-Serving Bias**

1. Taking personal credit for success but blaming external factors for failure.
2. Psychologists document various ways people show self-serving bias in their thinking and behavior.
3. Some researchers argue that self-serving biases reflect healthy psychological functioning, while others view them as potentially problematic.

### 13.4 YOUR SENSE OF SELF IS INFLUENCED BY CULTURAL FACTORS


* People's sense of self can differ based on cultural background.
* Collectivist and individualist cultures emphasize different aspects of the self.

**Collectivist Cultures:**

* Emphasize connections to family, social groups, and ethnic groups.
* Value group norms and obedience to authority figures.
* Children are raised to follow group norms and obey those in authority.
* Sense of self is influenced by personal relationships and social roles.
* Examples: Japan, Greece, Pakistan, China, some regions of Africa.

**Individualist Cultures:**

* Emphasize individual rights and freedoms.
* Value self-expression and diversity.
* Children are encouraged to be self-reliant and pursue personal success.
* Sense of self is based on feelings of being distinct from others.
* Examples: Northern and western Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States.

**Comparison:**

* Collectivist cultures: most important elements of a person's sense of self tend to reside in areas where the person's sense of self is connected with others.
* Individualist cultures: most important elements of a person's sense of self tend to reside within the person.

### 13.5 PSYCHODYNAMIC THEORY EMPHASIZES UNCONSCIOUS CONFLICTS

**Psychodynamic Theory** is a theoretical approach to personality developed by Sigmund Freud that emphasizes the role of unconscious conflicts in shaping behavior and influencing personality.

**Sigmund Freud** was a physician who is considered the father of psychoanalysis. He believed that many psychological problems were caused by psychological, rather than physical, factors. From his clinical work, he developed the psychodynamic theory of personality.

**Central Idea of Psychodynamic Theory:** The central idea of this theory is that unconscious forces, such as wishes, desires, and hidden memories, determine behavior and influence personality.

**Unconscious Conflicts:** Freud believed that unconscious mental activity can result in conflict between the three personality structures: the id, the superego, and the ego.

**Three Structures of Personality:**

* **Id:** The id is the most basic level of personality, existing completely submerged in the unconscious. It operates according to the pleasure principle, which pushes individuals to seek pleasure and avoid pain.
* **Superego:** The superego acts as a brake on the id and develops in childhood as the internalization of parental and societal standards of behavior. It is a rigid structure of morality or conscience.
* **Ego:** The ego mediates between the id and the superego, trying to satisfy the wishes of the id while being responsive to the rules of the superego. It operates according to the reality principle, which involves rational thought and problem solving.

**Unconscious Conflicts and Defense Mechanisms:** Unique interactions of the id, superego, and ego produce individual differences in personality. Conflicts between the id and the superego lead to anxiety, which is coped with through various defense mechanisms. These are unconscious mental strategies that protect individuals from distress.

**Common Defense Mechanisms:** Some common defense mechanisms include denial, repression, projection, reaction formation, rationalization, displacement, and sublimation.

**Contemporary Perspectives on Psychodynamic Theory:** While Freud's work is still influential in the humanities and arts, it has largely been abandoned by psychologists due to the lack of empirical evidence supporting its central premises. Contemporary neo-Freudians have modified Freud's ideas, focusing on social interactions and emotional attachments to parents or primary caregivers, which is embodied in object relations theory.

### 13.6 HUMANISTIC APPROACHES EMPHASIZE GOODNESS IN PEOPLE

* Emphasis on the unique goodness, growth, and self-understanding in shaping personality
* Emerged as a more positive view of personality against the backdrop of Freud's theories

**Humanistic Theories**:

* Abraham Maslow's motivation theory (self-actualization)
* Carl Rogers' person-centered approach to understanding personality and human relationships

**Personality Influenced by Self and Others**:

* Seek fulfillment of potential for personal growth through self-understanding
* **Two crucial issues**: personal understanding of life (self-concept) and others' evaluations

**Importance of Others' Evaluations**:

* Love and acceptance are essential in personality development
* Conditional vs. unconditional positive regard

**Conditions of Worth**:

* Parents' love and support based on children meeting their expectations
* Discrepancy between self-concept and others' evaluations
* Children abandon true feelings, dreams, and desires
* **Result**: personality based on getting approval from others

**Unconditional Positive Regard**:

* Acceptance and prizing of children regardless of behavior
* Separation of evaluations of child's behavior from evaluations of the child
* Helps children develop personalities based on their true selves
* Healthy sense of self-esteem and better chance for personal growth

**Review & Apply**:

a. Conditions of worth example: "I love you, but I am disappointed that you were careless and broke the vase."
b. Conditional positive regard example: "I love you so much more when you do your homework."
c. Parent who expresses disapproval of behavior while maintaining love for the child is more likely to raise a child who develops a personality based on their true self, as they are providing unconditional positive regard.

### 13.7 SOCIAL COGNITIVE APPROACHES FOCUS ON HOW THOUGHTS SHAPE PERSONALITY

**Social Cognitive Approaches to Personality**

* Shift in focus from learning theory to cognition in understanding human behavior and personality
* **Two major theories**: Expectancy Theory by Julian Rotter and Reciprocal Determinism by Albert Bandura

#### Expectancy Theory

* Developed by Julian Rotter (1954)
* Personality influenced by expectations
* Behaviors result from expectancies for reinforcement and values placed on reinforcers

**People's personalities are influenced by their general beliefs about control**:

- **Internal Locus of Control**
  * Belief that individuals can influence outcomes
  * **Example**: believing that hard work leads to good grades
- **External Locus of Control**
  * Belief that outcomes result from forces beyond personal control
  * **Example**: viewing a promotion as the result of luck, not hard work

#### Reciprocal Determinism

* Developed by Albert Bandura (1977a)
* Personality factors interact with situations to produce behavior

**Three factors influence how personality is expressed**: 
- **Environment**:
  * Specific features of the situation that affect behavior
- **Person Factors**:
  * Characteristics, self-confidence, and expectations
  * Influenced by past experiences and reinforcement
- **Behavior**:
  * Reflects both environment and person factors
  * Affects the environment in return

### 13.8 TRAIT APPROACHES DESCRIBE CHARACTERISTICS

**Trait Approaches to Personality**

* Focus on describing the behavioral tendencies that are consistent over time and across most situations
* Individuals differ in basic personality characteristics
* Personality traits exist on a continuum

**Eysenck's Trait Theory**

* Proposed by Hans Eysenck in the 1960s
* Personality is composed of traits in three dimensions:
  * Introversion/Extraversion
  * Stable/Unstable (Neuroticism)
  * High Constraint/Low Constraint (Psychoticism)

Terms:
* **Introversion**: shyness, reservedness, quietness
* **Extraversion**: sociability, outgoingness, boldness
* **Stable**: consistent moods and emotions
* **Neurotic**: frequent and dramatic mood swings, anxiety, moodiness, low self-opinion
* **Constraint**: impulse control, self-centeredness, lack of empathy

**Five-Factor Trait Theory (Big Five)**

* Identifies five basic personality traits: 
  * **Openness to experience**: imaginative, independent
  * **Conscientiousness**: careful, organized
  * **Extraversion**: outgoing, sociable
  * **Agreeableness**: trusting, helpful
  * **Neuroticism**: anxious, moody, depressed, low self-opinion
* Each person ranges from low to high on each trait
* Consistent with Eysenck's theory in some aspects

### 13.9 DO PERSONALITIES MATTER IN ROOMMATE RELATIONSHIPS?
* College students share living spaces with roommates, which can significantly impact their college experience
* Positive roommate relationships can lead to lifelong friendships; negative ones can cause stress
* Research suggests that similar personalities lead to better roommate relationships

**Value of Personality Assessments in Roommate Selection**

* Carli et al. (1991) study: personality similarity between roommates linked to higher relationship satisfaction and intent to live together the next year
* Personality tends to be stable over time, increasing likelihood that similarity is not due to choice alone

**Implications for Roommate Selection**

* Look for a roommate with similar personality traits, especially in areas important to you
* Preference for cleanliness is an example of a personality trait worth considering
* Options for determining potential roommates' cleanliness preferences: ask previous roommates, observe, or ask directly
* Many colleges and universities use personality questionnaires for roommate matching

**Biology and Personality**

* Nature and nurture influence personality development
* Biological factors, such as genes, brain structures, and neurochemistry, play a role in determining personality traits

**Learning Check: Applying the Concepts**

* Chloe should consider both Maddie and Nakisha's personality traits when selecting a roommate
* Maddie and Chloe share similarities in shyness, early bedtimes, and binge-watching preferences, which could lead to a positive relationship
* Nakisha's outgoing, spontaneous, and party-loving nature might encourage Chloe to socialize more but could also cause conflicts if their cleanliness preferences are not compatible
* Chloe should consider asking direct questions or observing potential roommates to determine compatibility in important personality traits.

### 13.10 PERSONALITY HAS A BIOLOGICAL BASIS

**Personality and Its Biological Basis**

- Personality traits are based on biological processes (DeYoung & Allen, 2019; McNaughton, 2021)
- One area of research focuses on the neurobiological underpinnings of introversion/extraversion

**Introversion and Extraversion: Differences in Optimal Levels of Arousal**

*Hans Eysenck's Trait Theory*
  - One dimension describing introversion/extraversion (Eysenck, 1967)
  - Differences in arousal produce behavioral differences

**Arousal and the Reticular Activating System (RAS)**

- A person's degree of arousal is based on processing in the RAS
- The RAS affects alertness and induces/terminates sleep stages

**Optimal Levels of Arousal**

*Extraverts*
  - Lower levels of arousal
  - Seek out exciting activities to optimally function
  - Chronically underaroused
  - Perform better in stimulating situations

*Introverts*
  - Higher levels of arousal
  - Seek out calming activities to optimally function
  - Chronically overaroused
  - Perform better in quiet environments

**Functioning at High Levels of Arousal**

- Each person has an optimal level of arousal
- Extraverts and introverts differ in their response to high levels of arousal

**Brain Imaging and the Biological Basis of Personality Traits**

- Multiple brain areas influence personality development and expression (Abram & DeYoung, 2017)
- Extraversion associated with reward-related brain areas (DeYoung et al., 2010; Eisenberger et al., 2005)
- Neuroticism involves brain regions involved in threat and negative emotions

### 13.11 PERSONALITY IS INFLUENCED BY GENES

**Genetic Influence on Personality: Twin Studies**

* Monozygotic (identical) twins share the same genes and are more similar in personality traits than dizygotic (fraternal) twins
* Numerous studies show identical twins are more similar in personality traits described by five-factor theory
* Genetic influence explains about 40-60% of variability between individuals for all personality traits
* Identical twins' similarity does not mean half of personality comes from genes, but genes explain a significant portion of why people differ on a given trait
* No specific genes for any particular personality trait; combined actions of hundreds of genes influence personality overall

**Genetic Influence on Personality: Adoption Studies**

* Children tend to be similar to biological parents or siblings, but adopted siblings raised in the same household are no more alike in personality than strangers
* Explanations: 1) No shared genes; 2) Different environments
* Personalities of adopted children bear no significant relationship to those of their adoptive parents
* Parenting style has less impact on personality than assumed, but adequate parenting is crucial for proper socialization and preventing antisocial behavior

**Comparison of People in Terms of Likely Similarity in Personality**

* **Identical twins**: much more likely to be similar in personality
* **Biological parents and their children**: somewhat more likely to be similar in personality
* **Adopted children raised in the same household who are not biologically related**: no more likely to be similar in personality
* **Dizygotic twins**: somewhat less likely to be similar in personality
* **Children and their adoptive parents**: no more likely to be similar in personality
* **Biological siblings**: somewhat more likely to be similar in personality

### 13.12 TEMPERAMENT IS INNATE

**Temperament** is a biologically-based tendency to feel or act in certain ways, which is broader than personality traits. It is the innate biological structure of an individual's personality that endures throughout their lives. According to Arnold Buss and Robert Plomin (1984), there are three main aspects of temperament:

* **Activity Level:** The overall amount of energy and behavior a child exhibits. Some children are high in activity level, while others are less vigorous or slow-paced.
* **Emotionality:** The intensity of the child's emotional reactions. Some children cry often or become frightened easily, while others anger quickly.
* **Sociability:** The child's tendency to affiliate with others. Children high in sociability prefer to be with others rather than alone.

These three aspects of temperament are influenced by genes and are evident from early childhood. Research suggests that temperament assessed at 14 months of age predicts personality characteristics three decades later (Tang et al., 2020).

The long-term effects of temperament can be significant throughout a person's development. For example, children who were classified as undercontrolled at age 3 were more likely to have antisocial behaviors and alcohol problems in early adulthood (Caspi et al., 2016; Rivenbark et al., 2018). Inhibited children were more likely to be anxious, become depressed, be unemployed, have less social support, and attempt suicide.

Research also suggests that shyness, which is a behavior identified in young children as early as 6 weeks, has a strong biological influence (Kagan & Snidman, 1991). However, nature and nurture work together to influence who we are, and supportive environments can help reduce shyness in children. Approximately one quarter of young children identified as potentially shy are not shy later in childhood (Kagan, 2011).

### 13.13 PERSONALITY STABILITY IS INFLUENCED BY BIOLOGY AND SITUATION

**Personality Stability and Change**

* Personality traits are generally stable over time, but there are exceptions.
* Childhood temperament may predict behavioral outcomes in early adulthood.
* **Personality is made up of two tendencies**: basic tendencies and characteristic adaptations.
* Basic tendencies are stable and determined by biology.
* Characteristic adaptations are adjustments to situational demands.
* People's personality traits become more stable as they age, but some aspects can change.

**Aspects of Personality that Change Over the Life Course**

* Research separates basic tendencies from characteristic adaptations.
* Basic tendencies remain stable over time, but people may adjust their behavior in response to new circumstances.
* People generally develop increased self-control and emotional stability as they get older.
* Personality changes can be influenced by major life events.

**Assessing Personality**

* Psychologists use various methods to assess personality.
* Self-report measures, such as questionnaires and interviews.
* Observer ratings, such as those from family members or peers.
* Projective tests, which present ambiguous stimuli and ask people to interpret them.
* Physiological measures, such as heart rate and brain activity.
* Behavioral measures, such as observing people in different situations.

**Factors Influencing Personality Stability and Change**

* Biological factors, such as genetics and brain structure.
* Environmental factors, such as upbringing and life experiences.
* Interactions between biology and environment.
* Personality traits may become more stable with age due to the accumulation of life experiences.

**Personality Stability vs. Change: The Debate**

* Some researchers argue that personality is relatively stable over the lifespan.
* Others argue that personality can change significantly throughout life.
* The debate continues as researchers explore the complex interplay between biology and environment in shaping personality.

**Movie Documentary "Up Series" by Michael Apted**

* Explores the idea that childhood experiences shape adult personality.
* Follows 14 British people from age 7 to 63, interviewing them every seven years.
* Shows apparent stability of personality over time.

**Personality Traits and Stability**

* Personality traits are relatively stable over the adult life span.
* Research finds strong evidence for stability in personality across long periods.
* Stability is lowest for young children and highest for those over age 50.

**Basic Tendencies vs. Characteristic Adaptations**

* Basic tendencies are traits determined largely by biological processes and are very stable.
* Characteristic adaptations are adjustments to situational demands and are somewhat consistent but do not indicate changes in basic tendencies.

**Age-Related Changes in Personality**

* People generally develop increased self-control and emotional stability as they get older.
* They become less neurotic, less extraverted, and less open to new experiences.
* These patterns of change are found both in self-reports and from ratings made by family and close friends.
* Age-related changes in personality occur independently of environmental influences and may be based in human biology.

**Situational Causes of Personality Change**

* Life's circumstances generally produce changes in personality, especially during emerging adulthood.
* Major life events, such as forming long-term relationships, having children, and building a career, can lead to changes in personality.
* These changes are often due to the new duties and obligations that come with these roles.
* Personality changes occur as a result of the expectations and experiences associated with age-related roles.

**Personality Assessment Methods**

* Self-report measures, such as questionnaires and interviews.
* Observer ratings, such as those from family members or peers.
* Projective tests, which present ambiguous stimuli and ask people to interpret them.
* Physiological measures, such as heart rate and brain activity.
* Behavioral measures, such as observing people in different situations.

### 13.14 SEVERAL METHODS ARE USED TO ASSESS PERSONALITY

- **Projective Measures:** These assessments involve interpreting an individual's responses to ambiguous stimuli, such as inkblots or stories. The Rorschach Inkblot Test is a well-known example.
- **Self-Report Measures:** Individuals provide information about their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors through questionnaires or interviews. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an example of a self-report measure.
- **Naturally Occurring Assessments:** These methods assess personality based on observing individuals in their natural environments. This can include analyzing their behavior at work, in social situations, or during interviews.
- **Observational Methods:** Observers systematically record and analyze an individual's behaviors and interactions with others. This method is often used in research settings to study specific aspects of personality.

**Understanding Personality in the Workplace:**

1. **Training and Development:** Knowledge of personality can be useful for training new employees, understanding their learning styles, and adapting teaching methods accordingly.
2. **Industrial-Organizational (I/O) Psychology:** This field applies psychological research to various aspects of work, including employee selection, recruitment, and training. I/O psychologists may use personality assessments to match employees with jobs based on their traits and skills.
3. **Career Opportunities:** I/O psychologists can work in academia, human resources departments, or as independent consultants. They help improve workplace productivity, minimize conflicts, and enhance employee satisfaction.

#### Projective Measures 

**Projective Measures** in psychology are techniques used to explore the unconscious mind by having individuals describe or tell stories about ambiguous stimulus items. The general idea is that people will project their own thoughts, motives, wishes, and conflicts onto these ambiguous items.

* **Psychodynamic Theory**: Considering unconscious conflicts as an influence on personality, projective measures are used to reveal hidden aspects of personality.
* **Rorschach Inkblot Test**: A well-known projective measure where individuals describe what they see in an apparently abstract inkblot. Criticized for revealing psychological disorders even when they do not exist.
* **Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)**: Developed to study motives related to personality, participants tell stories about ambiguous pictures and are scored based on the motivational themes that emerge. Useful for measuring motivational traits, especially those related to achievement, power, and affiliation.

#### Self Report Measures

**Self-Report Measures** are personality assessments where individuals respond to items on questionnaires. These measures only reveal what individuals report about themselves and do not attempt to uncover hidden wishes or conflicts.

* Used to assess how much self-reported answers predict behavior.
* Problems include the potential for individuals to provide socially desirable responses, lack of objective standards for comparison, and difficulty in comparing different people's self-reported measures.

#### Naturally Occurring Assessments

**Naturally Occurring Assessments of Personality**: Researchers use various methods to assess personality in daily life, such as electronically activated records (EAR) that track interactions and smartphone activity. These methods have shown that self-reports on the five-factor theory traits predict real-world behavior.

#### Observational Methods

**Observational Methods**: Observers can judge personality based on an individual's environment or behavior, but their judgments may not always be accurate as individuals can mask their true feelings or behave differently in different situations. Close acquaintances may predict behavior more accurately than strangers due to observing behavior across various circumstances.

* Friends' ratings tend to be more accurate for traits that are low in observability and high in evaluativeness, such as creativity.
* Self-ratings tend to be more accurate for traits that are not easily observed by others but meaningful to individuals, such as anxiety or optimism.

### 13.15 BEHAVIOR IS INFLUENCED BY PERSONALITY AND SITUATION

* Behavior is influenced by both personality and situational factors
* Personality traits predict behavior over time, but people are also sensitive to social context
* **Situationism**: the idea that behaviors are determined more by situations than by personality traits (Mischel, 1968)

**Person/Situation Debate**

* Mischel's critique of personality traits caused controversy in the field
* Social psychologists focus on situational forces, while personality psychologists focus on individual traits
* Personality is defined as relatively stable across situations, but Mischel argued for more emphasis on situational influences
* **Interactionism**: behavior is determined jointly by situations and underlying dispositions

**Interaction of Personality and Situation**

* Behavior expresses personality differently in various situations
* Strong situations (funerals, job interviews) tend to mask differences in personality due to the power of the social environment
* Weak situations (parks, bars, one's home) reveal differences in personality
* People choose situations based on their personality and affect those around them
* **Reciprocal determinism**: interactions occur between the person and the social environment

**Glossary**

* **situationism**: the theory that behavior is determined more by situations than by personality traits
* **interactionism**: the idea that behavior is determined jointly by situations and underlying traits.

## 14 PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS

**Understanding Common Mental Health Issues**

**Two ways to combat stigma**: Focus on commonality and education

**Key Questions**:

1. What is a psychological disorder?
2. How do people experience disorders of emotion, thought, and self?
3. Which disorders affect children?
4. How can we determine if someone is experiencing psychopathology?

**Introduction**:

- Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's battle with depression despite his public image (p. 563)
- Importance of understanding psychological disorders and their prevalence

**What Is a Psychological Disorder?**

- Common worldwide, causing significant disability (Patel, Chisholm, et al., 2016; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011)
- Affects approximately 1 in 4 Americans over age 18 (Kessler et al., 2005)
- Differences between sexes: some disorders more common in women (depression), others in men (antisocial personality disorder, childhood ADHD) (Figure 14.1)

**Criteria for Deciding Whether a Person is Experiencing a Psychological Disorder**:

1. Deviates from cultural norms for what is acceptable?
2. **Maladaptive**: interferes with daily life or causes significant distress
3. Self-destructive, causes personal distress, or threatens others
4. Causes discomfort and concern to others

**Limitations of the Criteria**:

| Criteria | Limitation | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deviates from cultural norms | People differ in their beliefs about what is acceptable | Eccentric behavior may be more tolerated in wealthy individuals |
| Maladaptive | Not necessarily a sign of an underlying disorder | Talking on the phone while driving puts you at risk for a crash but not a psychological disorder |
| Causes personal distress or threatens others | Doesn't always indicate a disorder | Distress about sexual orientation is not a disorder |
| Causes discomfort and concern to others | Not necessarily a disorder | Cyberbullying causes pain to targets but doesn't mean bullies have disorders |

**Determining Etiology, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Psychological Disorders**:

1. **Determine etiology**: factors contributing to disordered thoughts, emotions, and behaviors
2. **Identify and assess symptoms**: understand what is occurring
3. **Group symptoms into meaningful categories**: make a diagnosis
4. Identify possible treatments based on disorder categories

**Symptoms Classification:** 
- Melanie's prolonged sadness and refusal to attend college classes indicate the likely presence of a psychological disorder (possibly depression). 
- Jerome's eccentric behavior does not necessarily indicate a disorder, as it may be culturally acceptable for him. 
- Maria's aggressive driving is indicative of a psychological disorder, possibly road rage or an anxiety disorder. 
- Miguel's distress after his girlfriend breaks up with him is a normal response, but if it persists and interferes with daily life, it could indicate depression. 
- Josh's memory flashbacks after surviving a violent mugging are a normal response to trauma; however, if they persist and significantly impair his functioning, they may indicate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

### 14.2 THERE ARE TWO GENERAL WAYS TO VIEW THE CAUSES OF DISORDERS

**Diathesis-Stress Model**

* Explanation for how nature (genetics, biology) and nurture (environmental stressors) interact in the development of psychological disorders.
* An individual has a diathesis or underlying vulnerability to a disorder.
* Stress triggers the disorder when it exceeds an individual's coping abilities.
* Family history of mental health issues raises the possibility of vulnerability, but environment plays a role in whether the vulnerability manifests into a disorder.

**Biopsychosocial Approach**

* Most psychological disorders influenced by biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors.
* **Biological**: Brain function, genetics, gut microbiome
* **Psychological**: Thoughts, emotions, personality, learned experiences
* **Sociocultural**: Family relationships, socioeconomic status, natural disasters, cultural context

**College Students and Mental Health**

* Increased rates of psychological disorders among college students, particularly depression and anxiety.
* Factors contributing to increased psychopathology include enrollment from historically underrepresented groups and increased social media use.

**Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health**

* Distance learning and isolation led to psychological distress for many, including students, young children, and adults.
* Increased rates of serious psychological distress, suicidal thoughts, depression, and loneliness during the pandemic.

### 14.3 DISORDERED THOUGHTS, EMOTIONS, AND BEHAVIORS CAN BE ASSESSED AND CATEGORIZED

**Psychological Disorders Assessment and Categorization**

Clinical psychologists use various methods to diagnose psychological disorders and determine appropriate treatments. The assessment process includes interviewing the client, collecting self-reports, observing behavior, and administering psychological tests.

**Assessing Symptoms**:
1. **Interview**: Psychologists ask clients about current symptoms and recent experiences causing distress.
2. **Self-report**: Clients provide information about their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.
3. **Observation**: Behavioral observations reveal important information, especially for children.
4. **Psychological testing**: Tests like personality assessments or those measuring cognitive abilities help diagnose disorders.

**Categorizing Disordered Emotions, Thoughts, and Behaviors**:
1. **Historical Perspective**: For much of human history, psychological disorders were attributed to gods, witches, or evil spirits.
2. **Systematic Categorization**: In the late 1800s, Emil Kraepelin identified disorders based on symptom groups.
3. **DSM-5**: The standard tool for diagnosing psychological disorders since 1952, with revisions in 1980, 1987, 1994, and 2013.
4. **Dimensional Approach**: An alternative to the categorical approach, recognizing that symptoms exist on a continuum.
5. **Comorbidity**: Many psychological disorders occur together, and clients should be assessed for possible comorbid conditions.

**Assessment Process**:
1. Assessing symptoms using interviews, self-reports, observations, and psychological testing.
2. Making a diagnosis based on the DSM-5's diagnostic criteria.
3. Considering alternative approaches like the dimensional approach.
4. Evaluating for comorbid conditions.

**DSM-5 Psychological Disorders**:

* DSM-5 categorizes 19 major types of psychological disorders (Table 14.1)
* Involve disturbances in feelings, thoughts, and behaviors
* Emotions are central to some disorders, thoughts to others, and behaviors to yet others

**DSM-5 Disorders Categories**:

* **Neurodevelopmental disorders**: Autism spectrum disorder, Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders
* **Bipolar and related disorders**: Bipolar I disorder
* **Depressive disorders**: Major depressive disorder
* **Anxiety disorders**: Panic disorder, Obsessive-compulsive disorder, Posttraumatic stress disorder, Dissociative amnesia
* **Somatic symptom and related disorders**: Illness anxiety disorder
* **Feeding and eating disorders**: Anorexia nervosa, Enuresis (bed-wetting)
* **Sleep-wake disorders**: Narcolepsy
* **Sexual dysfunctions**: Erectile disorder, Gender dysphoria in adolescents and adults
* **Disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders**: Pyromania
* **Substance-related and addictive disorders**: Alcohol use disorder
* **Neurocognitive disorders**: Mild neurocognitive disorder (dementia)
* **Personality disorders**: Borderline personality disorder
* **Paraphilic disorders**: Exhibitionist disorder

**Cultural Syndromes**:

* Psychological disorders show both universal and culture-specific symptoms
* Disorders with strong biological components tend to be more similar across cultures
* Disorders heavily influenced by learning, context, or both are more likely to differ across cultures
* DSM-5 considers cultural factors for each psychological disorder
* **Examples of cultural syndromes**: taijin kyofusho (Japan), maladi moun (Haiti), khyâl cap (Cambodia)
* Clinicians need to be sensitive to cultural issues in diagnoses and treatments

**Dimensional vs. Categorical Approach**:

* Psychologists mean that psychological disorders are dimensional when they exist on a continuum rather than distinct categories
* Disorders can have overlapping symptoms and severity levels
* Dimensional approach allows for more nuanced understanding of disorders and their treatment

**Emotional Disorders**:

* Emotions and moods can be normal or disordered
* Anxiety and sadness can become debilitating when they interfere with daily life
* Emotional disorders can disrupt the ability to work, learn, and play.

### 14.4 ANXIETY DISORDERS MAKE PEOPLE FEARFUL AND TENSE

**Anxiety Disorders**

* Abnormal condition characterized by excessive fear in the absence of danger
* People perceive ambiguous situations as threatening, focus excessive attention on perceived threats, and recall threatening events more easily
* More than 1 in 4 Americans will develop an anxiety disorder during their lifetime

**Symptoms and Development of Anxiety Disorders**

**Five Types of Anxiety Disorders**

**Specific Phobia**

* Unreasonable fear of something that is not likely to hurt you
* Impairs your life, causes significant distress, or both
* Classified based on the object of the fear (e.g., snakes, enclosed spaces, heights, flying)

**Social Anxiety Disorder**

* Fear of being negatively evaluated by others
* Includes fears of social situations, public speaking, meeting new people, and eating in front of others
* Affects around 1 in 8 people at some point in their lifetime
* Symptoms can cause significant impairment in academic settings

**Generalized Anxiety Disorder**

* Constant anxiety not focused on one object or situation
* People worry about everything and are always on the alert for problems
* Results in distractibility, fatigue, irritability, sleep problems, headaches, restlessness, lightheadedness, and muscle pain
* Affects just under 6% of the US population at some point in their lives

**Panic Disorder**

* Overwhelming attacks of terror and worry about having additional panic attacks
* Symptoms include sweating, racing heart, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, lightheadedness, and numbness and tingling in hands and feet
* Affects an estimated 3% of the population in a given year
* Women are twice as likely to be diagnosed as men

**Agoraphobia**

* Fear of being in situations from which escape is difficult or impossible
* People have a fear of crowded places or using public transportation, causing panic attacks
* As a result, people may avoid going into open spaces or to places with crowds
* In extreme cases, people may feel unable to leave their homes

**Development of Anxiety Disorders**

* Biopsychosocial approach explains the etiology of various types of anxiety
* Temperament is a biologically determined aspect of personality and can increase the risk for anxiety disorders
* Fears can be learned through classical conditioning or observational learning

### 14.5 SOME DISORDERS INVOLVE UNWANTED AND INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS THAT INCREASE ANXIETY

**Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**

* Affects 1-2% of the population
* Involves frequent intrusive thoughts that create anxiety and compulsive actions that temporarily reduce anxiety
* More common in women than men, begins in early adulthood

**Obsessions**:

* Recurrent, intrusive, unwanted thoughts or urges or mental images that increase anxiety
* Intense worry and fears of contamination, accidents, or one's own aggression

**Compulsions**:

* Particular acts performed to reduce anxiety
* **Most common**: cleaning, checking, and counting
* Temporary reduction in anxiety leads to negative reinforcement, increasing the likelihood of repeating the behavior

**Development of OCD**:

* Can result from psychological factors (learning by conditioning)
* Anxiety paired with specific event through classical conditioning
* Reduction of anxiety negatively reinforces the behavior through operant conditioning
* **Biological causes**: genetic origin, glutamate-related genes, brain abnormalities in the caudate

**Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**

* Result of severe stress or emotional trauma
* Frequent and recurring unwanted thoughts related to the trauma
* Nightmares, intrusive thoughts, flashbacks

**Risk varies by type of trauma**: intimate partner violence (11.4%), unexpected death of loved one (5.5%), war-related trauma (3.5%), physical violence (2.8%), other traumas (9.2%)
* Women are more likely to develop the disorder, especially during adolescence
* Symptoms include chronic tension, anxiety, health problems, memory and attention problems, inability to forget, increased physiological responsiveness to stimuli associated with the traumatic event

### 14.6 DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS INVOLVE SAD, EMPTY, OR IRRITABLE MOOD

**Depressive Disorders: Major Depressive Disorder vs. Persistent Deppressive Disorder**

- Depression is a common emotion, but only lasting episodes of depressed mood that impair a person's life are diagnosed as depressive disorders.
- Two types of depressive disorders: major depressive disorder (MDD) and persistent depressive disorder (PDD).

**Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**:
- Characterized by extremely sad, empty, or irritable mood that lasts for two weeks or more.
- Other symptoms include changes in weight or sleep, loss of energy, difficulty concentrating, feelings of self-reproach or guilt, and frequent thoughts of death.
- Affects about 10% of Americans annually and approximately 21% at some point in their lives.
- Impairs daily life and tends to persist for several months to years.
- Women are nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with MDD as men.

**Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD)**:
- Characterized by mildly or moderately depressed mood most days for at least two years.
- Periods of PDD last from 2 to 20+ years, with a typical duration of about 5 to 10 years.
- People may have many of the same symptoms as those with MDD but they are less intense.
- Approximately 2-3% of the population is diagnosed with PDD.

**Comparison**:
- MDD: Extremely depressed mood for at least two weeks, impairing daily life.
- PDD: Mildly or moderately depressed mood for many years.

### 14.7 MANY FACTORS INFLUENCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS

**Factors Influencing the Development of Depressive Disorders**

**Biological Factors**:
- **Genetic component**: Identical twins have a higher likelihood of developing depression than fraternal twins (Kendler et al., 2018; Levinson, 2006)
- **Neurotransmitter involvement**: Major depression is linked to various neurotransmitters that regulate emotion (Oakes et al., 2017)
- **Brain structure alterations**: Reduced connectivity between prefrontal and limbic brain regions (Rupprechter et al., 2020)
- **Biological rhythms**: People with depression enter REM sleep more quickly and experience excessive sleeping (Palagini et al., 2013)

**Psychological Factors**:
- **Cognitive biases**: Paying greater attention to negative stimuli, maladaptive emotion control strategies (LeMoult & Gotlib, 2019)
- **Life stressors**: Death of a loved one, divorce, multiple negative events (Hammen, 2005)
- **Interpersonal relationships**: Quality of friendships is protective against depression (Beck, 1967, 1976)
- **Cognitive triad**: Negative thoughts about self, situation, and future (Beck, 1967, 1976)
- **Learned helplessness**: Belief of being unable to change negative events (Seligman, 1974, 1975)

**Sociocultural Factors**:
- **Global prevalence**: Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting over 250 million people (World Health Organization, 2020a)
- **Resource gaps**: Large discrepancies between numbers of people with psychological disorders and treatment resources in developing countries (Patel, Xiao, et al., 2016)
- **Stigma**: Prevents people from seeking help due to shame or embarrassment (Andrade et al., 2014)
- **Gender differences**: Depression is twice as common in women than men (Salk et al., 2017)
- **Gender roles**: Women internalize feelings, leading to depression and anxiety; men externalize feelings with alcohol, drugs, and violence (Holden, 2005)

**Learned Helplessness Theory**:
This theory suggests that people come to believe they are unable to change negative events in their lives. They expect bad things to happen and feel hopeless about making positive changes. This hopelessness is a key symptom of depression and can lead to thoughts of suicide (Abramson et al., 1989).

### 14.8 WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF YOU THINK A FRIEND OR LOVED ONE MIGHT BE CONSIDERING SUICIDE?
#### USING PSYCHOLOGY IN YOUR LIFE: Helping a Friend or Loved One Considering Suicide

**Risk Factors for Suicide:**
- Overwhelming interpersonal distress
- Frustrated need to belong and feel connected with others
- Frustrated need for competence and perceived inability to do things
- Genetic risk factor
- Psychological disorders, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia

**Actions to Help a Suicidal Person:**
1. **Take all threats seriously:** Assume that the person is capable of committing suicide and ask directly if they are considering it. Asking will not make them more likely to consider suicide if they haven't already.
2. **Get help:** Encourage the person to speak with a trained professional as soon as possible. This could be a counselor at their school, a local suicide prevention hotline, or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK/8255).
3. **Provide support:** Let the person know you care about them and value your relationship. Offer genuine admiration for their abilities and ask for help on projects or issues you're struggling with to challenge their perceived sense of incompetence.
4. **Express hope:** Suicide is permanent, but the problems that lead someone to feel suicidal are often temporary. Encourage them to seek help and explore other options to overcome their current situation.

### 14.9 BIPOLAR DISORDERS INVOLVE MANIA

**1. Overview:** Bipolar disorders are a type of mood disorder characterized by episodes of greatly elevated mood called mania or manic episodes, and periods of depression. Mariah Carey is an example of a celebrity who has publicly shared her experience with bipolar disorder.

**2. Symptoms of Manic Episodes:**
   * Abnormally and persistently elevated mood
   * Increased energy level and physical activity
   * Diminished need for sleep
   * Grandiose ideas
   * Racing thoughts
   * Extreme distractibility
   * Heightened levels of activity and extreme happiness often result in excessive involvement in pleasurable but foolish activities
   * Agitation and restlessness instead of positivity for some people
   * Manic episodes last one week or longer

**3. Types of Bipolar Disorders:**

   **Bipolar I Disorder:**
      * Extremely elevated moods (mania) lasting at least one week
      * May include severe thought disturbances or hallucinations
      * Manic episodes can cause significant impairment in daily living and often result in hospitalization

   **Bipolar II Disorder:**
      * Alternating between mildly elevated mood (hypomania) for at least four days and extremely depressed mood for at least two weeks
      * Hypomania may be somewhat disruptive to a person's life but does not cause significant impairment in daily living or require hospitalization
      * At least one episode of major depressive disorder lasting at least two weeks is required for diagnosis

**4. Development of Bipolar Disorders:**
   * Around 3-4% of the population will experience a bipolar disorder in their lifetime
   * Equally prevalent in women and men
   * Emerges most commonly during late adolescence or early adulthood
   * Strong genetic component
   * Twin studies reveal that if one twin has the disorder, an identical twin is three times more likely to have it than a fraternal twin
   * Research on Amish community identified several genes potentially involved in bipolar disorder
   * Disorders are more severe and appear at younger ages in successive generations

**5. Mania in Bipolar I vs. II:**
   * In bipolar I disorder, manic episodes can be so serious as to make it hard for a person to know what is real, causing significant impairment in daily living and often requiring hospitalization
   * In bipolar II disorder, hypomania may be somewhat disruptive but does not cause significant impairment or require hospitalization. Hypomania is often characterized by heightened creativity and productivity.

### 14.10 SCHIZOPHRENIA INVOLVES A DISCONNECTION FROM REALITY

**Schizophrenia** is a psychological disorder characterized by extreme alterations in thought, perception, and consciousness, leading to a break from reality and the experience of psychosis (inability to differentiate what is real from imagined). The term "schizophrenia" means "splitting of the mind."

* **Symptoms**: Schizophrenia is marked by motor, cognitive, behavioral, and perceptual abnormalities that impair social, personal, and occupational functioning. To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, a person must have shown continuous signs of disturbances for at least six months.
* **DSM-5 Symptoms**: Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on five major symptoms**: (1) delusions, (2) hallucinations, (3) disorganized speech, (4) disorganized behavior, and (5) negative symptoms. A diagnosis requires a person to show two or more of these symptoms, with at least one being from the first three.
* **Positive Symptoms**: Positive symptoms are excesses or additions to normal experiences. They include**:
  * **Delusions**: False beliefs that reflect breaks from reality (persecution, referential, grandiose, identity, guilt, control). People with schizophrenia persist in their delusional beliefs despite clear evidence to the contrary.
  * **Hallucinations**: False sensory experiences in the absence of any genuine external input (auditory, visual, olfactory, or bodily). People with schizophrenia often experience auditory hallucinations as accusatory voices.
  * **Disorganized speech**: Incoherent speech that fails to follow a normal conversational structure, making it difficult for others to understand what is being said.
  * **Disorganized behavior**: Acting in strange or unusual ways, such as wearing multiple layers of clothing on hot days, pacing and wringing hands, or alternating between anger and laughter.
* **Negative Symptoms**: Negative symptoms are deficits in functioning, including**:
  * Apathy and lack of emotion
  * Slowed speech
  * Reduced amount of movement
  * Lack of initiation of behavior and social withdrawal

**Learning Goal Check**:

a. Alistair's behavior represents **disorganized behavior** (pacing, yelling at pigeons).
b. Lester's speech represents **disorganized speech** (switching topics, making nonsensical statements).
c. Marvin's belief is a **delusion** (belief in government agents inserting thoughts).
d. Melba's behavior and emotional expression represent **negative symptoms** (lack of emotion, reduced movement, difficulty speaking).
e. Dolores' experience is a **hallucination** (hearing her mother's voice when she is not present).

### 14.11 SCHIZOPHRENIA IS CAUSED BY BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

**Biological Factors Influence the Development of Schizophrenia**

- *Schizophrenia runs in families* (Henriksen et al., 2017)
  - Identical twins: 48% risk if one twin has schizophrenia
  - Fraternal twins: 14% risk if one twin has schizophrenia
  - Parent with schizophrenia: 13% risk for a child
  - Both parents have schizophrenia: 50% risk for a child
- *Genetics do not cause the disorder but increase susceptibility*
- *Brain abnormalities* (Chand et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2004)
  - Enlarged ventricles in brain MRIs
  - Less brain tissue, especially in frontal lobes and medial temporal lobes
  - Possible problem of connection between brain regions rather than diminished functions
- *Brain impairments may emerge before obvious symptoms* (Walker et al., 2004)
  - Unusual social behaviors, severe negative emotions, motor disturbances in young children

**Environmental Factors Affect the Development of Schizophrenia**

- *Genetics do not account fully for onset and severity* (Gomes et al., 2019; McGrath et al., 2017; Walker et al., 2004)
- *Environmental stress contributes to development* (Tienari et al., 1990, 1994; Tienari et al., 2004; Walder et al., 2014)
  - Dysfunctional family environment increases risk for those genetically susceptible
- *Urban environments and air pollution may be triggers* (Torrey, 1999; Horsdal et al., 2019)
- *Virus hypothesis: inflammation during pregnancy plays a role* (Brown & Derkits, 2010; Canetta et al., 2014)

**Diathesis-Stress Model and Schizophrenia**

The diathesis-stress model suggests that both genetic predisposition (diathesis) and environmental stressors (stress) contribute to the development of schizophrenia. People with a genetic risk for schizophrenia who are exposed to dysfunctional family environments or other stressors have a higher likelihood of developing the disorder compared to those without such exposure. Conversely, people without a genetic risk have a low risk regardless of their environment.

**Disorders of Self**

In dissociative disorders and eating disorders, a person's sense of self becomes disrupted or unduly influenced by body image. These conditions can cause significant problems in work, social situations, and relationships. Unlike schizophrenia, these disorders do not involve hallucinations or radical mood swings but can still have serious consequences for the individual and those around them.

### 14.12 PERSONALITY DISORDERS ARE MALADAPTIVE WAYS OF RELATING TO THE WORLD

This section discusses **two types of personality disorders**, **borderline personality disorder** (BPD) and **antisocial personality disorder** (APD), which belong to Cluster B in the DSM-5's classification of personality disorders.

**Cluster B: Dramatic, Emotional, or Erratic Behaviors:** This cluster includes four types of personality disorders: Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, and Narcissistic. BPD and APD are the most researched disorders in this group.

**Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD):**

* **Symptoms:** Disturbances in identity, moods, and impulse control; intense fear of abandonment, manipulative behavior, emotional instability, impulsivity, self-mutilation, high risk for suicide, abnormal functioning of the frontal lobes.
* **Development:** Officially recognized in 1980; affects approximately 1-2% of adults, more common in women than men; lack of a strong sense of self, intense fear of abandonment, manipulative behavior, emotional instability, impulsivity, high risk for suicide.
* **Causes:** Environmental factors such as trauma or abuse, caretakers who did not accept or were unreliable, or encouraged dependence.

**Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD):**

* **Symptoms:** Disregard for and violation of the rights of others, lack of remorse, focus on own pleasure, immediate gratification, superficially charming but insincere, shameless, unsocial, incapable of love.
* **Relation to Psychopathy:** APD is a diagnosis for individuals who behave in socially undesirable ways, while psychopathy is a related but distinct personality trait characterized by a general lack of caring for the welfare of others and callousness toward others.
* **Prevalence:** About 1-4% of the population has APD; more common in men than women; most apparent in late adolescence and early adulthood, improves around age 40 for those without psychopathic traits.
* **Physiological Abnormalities:** Reduced psychophysiological response to punishment, abnormalities in multiple brain regions involved in responding to fear and controlling impulses.

**Review:** People with antisocial personality disorder (APD) have a disregard for and violation of the rights of others and lack remorse, while psychopaths possess an extreme version of APD with additional traits such as grandiose self-worth, cunning/manipulativeness, and boldness/fearlessness.

### 14.13 DISSOCIATIVE DISORDERS INVOLVE DISRUPTIONS IN THE SENSE OF SELF

* Extreme versions of dissociation, involving disruptions of identity, memory, or conscious awareness
* Some parts of memory are split off from a person's conscious awareness
* Result from extreme stress and trauma

**Symptoms and Development of Dissociative Disorders**

* Dissociative disorders involve disruptions in the sense of self
* Symptoms include forgetting personal facts, loss of identity, and traveling to unfamiliar locations
* Believed to result from extreme stress and trauma

**Dissociative Amnesia**

* A person forgets that an event happened or loses awareness of a large block of time
* Cannot be accounted for by ordinary forgetting or drugs/alcohol
* **Rarest and most extreme form**: dissociative fugue, which involves loss of identity and traveling to another location

**Symptoms and Development of Dissociative Amnesia**

* Forgetting personal facts, including name and address
* Sudden memory loss
* Cannot account for large chunks of time
* **Rarest and most extreme form**: dissociative fugue
	+ Loss of identity
	+ Traveling to another location
	+ Amnesia for events during the fugue state

**Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)**

* Presence of two or more distinct identities in the same individual
* Most common in women who report severe childhood abuse
* Developed as a coping mechanism to deal with trauma
* Different identities have distinct characteristics, including gender, sexual orientation, age, language, interests, physiological profiles, and patterns of brain activation
* Diagnosis often occurs when a person has difficulty accounting for large chunks of time

**Symptoms and Development of Dissociative Identity Disorder**

* Two or more distinct identities
* Developed as a coping mechanism to deal with childhood abuse
* Different identities have distinct characteristics
* Amnesia between identities
* Diagnosis often occurs when a person has difficulty accounting for large chunks of time

### 14.14 EATING DISORDERS INVOLVE DISTORTIONS OR DISTRESS ABOUT BODY IMAGE

**Eating Disorders**

* One of the 19 DSM-5 categories
* Involve distortions or distress about body image
* Commonly begin in adolescence and peak in emerging adulthood
* Four times more likely for women than men
* **Three main types**: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder

**Symptoms of Eating Disorders**

* Chronic dieting leading to harmful psychological consequences
* Negative body image and low self-esteem
* Extreme weight loss methods (drugs, fasting, excessive exercise, purging)
* Distorted perception of body size or shape

**Anorexia Nervosa**

* Excessive fear of becoming fat
* Restriction of food intake leading to significantly low body weight
* Distorted body image despite being underweight
* Begins in early adolescence, affects both genders and various demographics
* **Serious health problems**: heart disease, loss of bone density, high mortality rate

**Bulimia Nervosa**

* Alternating between dieting, binge eating, and compensating behaviors (purging)
* Regularly binge eat, feel eating is out of control
* Worry excessively about body weight issues
* Engage in purging behaviors or excessive exercise to remove food from the body
* More common in women than men
* Secretive behavior due to shame and embarrassment
* **Serious health problems**: dental and cardiac disorders, but not usually fatal

**Binge-Eating Disorder**

* Engage in binge eating at least once a week without purging
* Eat very quickly and feel guilt and embarrassment
* Hide behavior from others
* Often affected by obesity
* More common among men than women

**Childhood Disorders**

* Emil Kraepelin did not mention childhood disorders in his text
* First edition of DSM considered children as small adults
* Many children and adolescents experience anxiety, depression, and emerging symptoms of schizophrenia
* Important to support positive mental health in children and adolescents.

### 14.15 CHILDREN MAY EXPERIENCE NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS

**Neurodevelopmental Disorders** in children are a category of psychological disorders as per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). These disorders affect various aspects of a child's development, including intellectual functioning, communication, social interaction, language, motor skills, and attention.

**Six Neurodevelopmental Disorders**:

1. **Intellectual disabilities**: Deficits in intellectual and adaptive functioning that begin during childhood or adolescence. Affects the ability to learn and adapt to daily life demands.
2. **Communication disorders**: Deficits in language, speech, or communication; symptoms begin in childhood. Examples include stuttering and difficulty learning a language.
3. **Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)**: Persistent impairment in social interaction, unresponsiveness, impaired language, social, and cognitive development, restricted, repetitive behavior, and symptoms begin in early childhood.
4. **Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)**: Hyperactive, inattentive, and impulsive behavior that causes social or academic impairment; begins before age 12.
5. **Specific learning disorders**: Difficulty learning and using academic skills (reading, mathematics, or writing) that is below the expected level for age, education, and intelligence; begins during school-age years.
6. **Motor disorders**: Recurrent motor and/or vocal tics (muscle spasms) that cause marked distress or impairment or deficits in developing or being able to show coordinated motor skills; symptoms begin in childhood.

**Normal Childhood Development vs. Neurodevelopmental Disorders**:

It is essential to consider neurodevelopmental disorders within the context of normal childhood development. Some symptoms, such as bed-wetting, are normal for young children but not for older ones. However, other behaviors significantly deviate from normal development and may indicate a neurodevelopmental disorder.

### 14.16 AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER INVOLVES SOCIAL DEFICITS AND RESTRICTED INTERESTS

* **Deficits in social interaction**:
  * Seemingly unaware of others
  * Lack of eye contact and use of gaze to gain attention
  * Failure to respond to vocalizations or smile at caregivers
  * Difficulty establishing social relationships
* **Impaired communication**:
  * Severe impairments in verbal and nonverbal communication
  * May not vocalize for the purpose of communicating
  * Deficits evident by 14 months of age
* **Restricted, repetitive behaviors and interests**:
  * Focus on seemingly trivial details in surroundings
  * Upsetting by changes in routine or environment
  * Repetitive and obsessive play
  * Sensory focus on objects
  * Self-injury and agitation when upset

ASD was first described in 1943 by Leo Kanner. It affects approximately 1-2% of children, with boys outnumbering girls 5 to 1. The disorder varies in severity from mild social impairments to severe social and intellectual impairments. High-functioning autism, also known as Asperger's syndrome, is a term for individuals with normal intelligence but deficits in social interaction.

Symptoms of ASD can be detected before diagnosis through behaviors such as focusing more on objects than people during social interactions and fewer instances of looking at another person's face. Deficits in communication are evident by 14 months of age, and restricted, repetitive behaviors and interests may include focusing on unimportant details, sensory stimulation, and self-injury.

ASD is the result of both genetic and environmental factors. Potential risk factors for ASD include older-age parents, maternal illness during pregnancy, birth complications, and prenatal or early childhood exposure to air pollution. Brain development in children with ASD differs from typical brain development, with unusual growth patterns during the first two years of life and abnormal development during adolescence. Research is ongoing to understand the genetic and environmental factors contributing to ASD.

It is important to note that there is no evidence linking vaccines to the development of autism spectrum disorder. The increase in diagnoses from 1991 to 1997 was likely due to greater awareness and a broader application of the diagnosis.

### 14.17 ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER IS A DISRUPTIVE IMPULSE CONTROL DISORDER

* Overly active, inattentive, and impulsive
* Difficulty following directions and rules
* Struggle with social cues and making friends
* Exaggerations of typical childhood behaviors interfering with academic and social functioning
* Symptoms must be present before age 12

**Prevalence**:

* 4-7% of children in the US
* 5% of children globally
* More common in boys than girls
* Increasingly diagnosed in girls, people of color, and obese children

**Development**:

* Causes unknown, likely a combination of genetic and environmental factors
* Brain development may be slower than average, affecting attention, cognitive control, emotional regulation, and motivation
* Diagnosis typically occurs when children enter structured settings like school

**Across the Life Span**:

* Children not outgrowing ADHD by adulthood
* Adults with ADHD struggle academically and in the workplace
* About 4% of adults have ADHD symptoms
* Many adults learn to adapt, but face lower socioeconomic levels and frequent job changes

**Diagnostic Criteria**:

To determine if a child's behavior meets diagnostic criteria for ADHD:

1. Presence of symptoms before age 12
2. Symptoms interfere significantly with academic or social functioning
3. Persistence of symptoms in multiple settings (home, school, etc.)
4. Rule out other causes (e.g., medical conditions, substance use)

**Application**:

Your nephew's behavior might indicate ADHD if:

1. He exhibits symptoms before age 12
2. His behaviors significantly interfere with academic or social functioning
3. The symptoms persist in multiple settings (home and school)
4. Other causes have been ruled out (e.g., medical conditions, substance use)

## 15 PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENTS

- Technology-based treatments use smartphones, computer programs, or the internet for psychological treatment. (p. 606)
- Psychological disorders can be treated effectively with therapy. (The actress Kerry Washington and singer Katy Perry are among those who have publicly endorsed therapy.)
- This chapter discusses the basic principles of therapy and how they are adapted to treat specific disorders.

**Historical Perspective**:
- Early views of psychopathology attributed causes to spirits or demons, leading to ineffective treatments like magic potions, exorcism, bloodletting, and drilling holes into the skull. (p. 607)
- During the Middle Ages, people with psychological disorders were often placed in asylums under terrible conditions, with no effective treatments. (p. 607)
- In the late 18th century, Philippe Pinel and Dorothea Dix advocated for moral treatment, which involved close contact with patients and careful observation. (p. 607)

**Modern Treatments**:
- Effective treatments for psychological disorders exist but do not offer instant cures. (p. 608)
- Modern therapy involves a continuous cycle of assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. (p. 608)
- The choice of treatment depends on the type and severity of symptoms as well as the specific diagnosis. (p. 608)

**Barriers to Treatment**:
- Some people do not seek treatment due to personal or cultural beliefs, feeling they can cope on their own or finding treatment humiliating. (p. 609)
- Financial and practical barriers may also prevent people from getting treatment, such as lack of knowledge about services or long wait times. (p. 609)

### 15.1 SOME TYPES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY FOCUS ON PROVIDING INSIGHT

**Psychotherapy**: Any formal psychological treatment aimed at changing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Interactions between practitioner and client are vital in helping clients understand their symptoms and problems, providing solutions.

**Goals and Techniques of Psychodynamic Therapy**:

- Developed by Sigmund Freud and Josef Breuer
- Based on the idea that psychological disorders are caused by prior experiences, especially early traumatic experiences, creating unconscious conflicts.
- **Techniques**: free association, dream analysis, identifying unconscious conflicts.
- **Goal**: Increase clients' awareness of their own unconscious psychological processes and how they affect daily functioning (insight).
- **Later developments**: psychodynamic therapy, examining unconscious needs, motives, and defenses.
- Controversial due to expense and time-consuming nature, limited scientific evidence for effectiveness.

**Goals and Techniques of Humanistic Therapy**:

- Emphasizes personal experience and individual belief systems.
- Helps people understand themselves and their goals.
- Gaining insight supports personal growth.
- **Client-centered therapy**: developed by Carl Rogers, encourages self-understanding and fulfilling potential.
- Safe and comforting environment.
- **Active listening**: therapist listens attentively, clarifies feelings, accepts clients through unconditional positive regard.
- Few practitioners follow humanistic theory strictly but use techniques in establishing a good therapeutic relationship.

**Comparison of Insight in Psychodynamic and Humanistic Therapies**:

- **Psychoanalysis/Psychodynamic Therapy**: Insight is the awareness of unconscious conflicts that cause inner conflict and impair daily functioning.
- **Humanistic Therapy**: Insight is the understanding of oneself and personal goals, supporting personal growth.

### 15.2 BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE TREATMENTS AIM TO CHANGE THOUGHTS, FEELINGS, AND BEHAVIORS DIRECTLY

**15.2 Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies**

* **Three therapies that aim to change thoughts, feelings, and/or behaviors directly**: Behavior Therapy, Cognitive Therapy, and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

**Behavior Therapy**

* Focuses on changing maladaptive behaviors through the use of classical and operant conditioning
* **Classical conditioning**: extinguishing a phobia by exposing the person to the feared object in settings where nothing bad happens
* **Operant conditioning**: behavior modification, which helps people learn desired behaviors and unlearn unwanted behaviors
	+ Desired behaviors are reinforced with small treats, praise, or tokens
	+ Unwanted behaviors are ignored or punished
	+ Token economies: clients earn tokens for good behavior and trade them for rewards or privileges
* **Social skills training**: teaching clients appropriate ways to act in specific social situations
	+ Modeling: therapist acts out an appropriate behavior, client imitates it, rehearses it, and uses it in real-world situations

**Cognitive Therapy**

* Focuses on changing distorted thought patterns to lessen or eliminate maladaptive behaviors and emotions
* **Cognitive restructuring**: helping clients recognize distorted thought patterns and replace them with more realistic, positive thoughts
* **Rational-emotive therapy**: therapist acts as a teacher, explaining clients' errors in thinking and demonstrating more adaptive ways to think and feel

**Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**

* Incorporates techniques from both behavior therapy and cognitive therapy
* Corrects clients' faulty cognitions and trains them to engage in new behaviors
* Effective for many types of psychological disorders, especially anxiety disorders and depressive disorders

### 15.3 THE CONTEXT OF THERAPY MATTERS

* People seek therapy due to various reasons and circumstances, leading to different symptoms, disorders, and treatments.
* Social and cultural contexts play significant roles in therapy.

**Social Anxiety vs. Legal Requirements**

* Some people seek therapy due to psychological disorders interfering with their lives (social anxiety).
* Others are required to undergo treatment after breaking the law.

**Group Therapy**

* Developed due to a shortage of therapists during World War II.
* **Advantages over individual therapy**: cost, social skills improvement, and learning from others' experiences.
* Group therapy varies in client types, duration, theoretical perspectives, and group size.
* Structured or loosely organized based on the therapist's preferred approach.
* Effective for disorders such as bulimia nervosa and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

**Family Therapy**

* A systems approach to therapy considers individuals within a larger context.
* Family members play an essential role in treatment.
* Change in individual behavior affects the entire system.
* **Goal**: heal problems for the entire family.

**Cultural Beliefs and Treatment**

* Different cultures have unique views on psychological disorders and their treatment.
* Symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment vary across cultures.
* Effective therapists understand clients' cultural beliefs and adapt treatments accordingly.

**Systems Approach in Family Therapy**

* Every individual is part of a larger context.
* Change in individual behavior affects the entire system.
* **Goal**: heal problems for the entire family.

**Importance of a Systems Approach in Family Therapy**

* Understanding the interconnectedness within families leads to more effective treatment.
* Addressing the entire system rather than just the individual can lead to long-term change and improved relationships.

### 15.4 BIOLOGICAL THERAPIES ARE EFFECTIVE FOR CERTAIN DISORDERS

**Biological Therapies** for certain psychological disorders are based on the notion that these disorders result from abnormalities in bodily processes, requiring treatment that addresses physical problems. This approach is reflected in medical interventions.

**Psychotropic Medications**:

* Drugs used to treat specific psychological disorders
* Assumes psychological disorders result from imbalances in neurotransmitters or improperly functioning receptors
* Act by changing brain neurochemistry
* **Most common classes**:
  * **Anti-anxiety drugs**: Temporarily increase sense of calm, minor tranquilizers, side effects include drowsiness and addiction (Valium, Xanax, Ativan)
  * **Antidepressant drugs**: Increase positive mood, reduce emotionality, impulsiveness, and arousal, side effects include sexual dysfunction, nausea, nervousness, weight gain (Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, Anafranil, Tofranil, Elavil)
  * **Mood stabilizer drugs**: Help even out moods, especially manic episodes, side effects include mineral blunting of positive emotion (Lithium)
  * **Antipsychotic drugs**: Reduce positive symptoms of schizophrenia (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior), conventional antipsychotics (first-generation antipsychotics) have side effects like tardive dyskinesia, seizures, lethargy (Thorazine, Haldol), atypical antipsychotics (second-generation antipsychotics) have potential side effects like potentially fatal loss of white blood cells, seizures, heart rate problems, weight gain, Type 2 diabetes (Clozaril, Risperdal, Zyprexa, Seroquel)
  * **Stimulants**: Decrease hyperactivity and distractibility, increase attention and concentration, side effects include insomnia, reduced appetite, body twitches, temporary suppression of growth (Methylphenidate, Ritalin, Amphetamine, Adderall)
* Commonly used to treat specific disorders; drugs from one category may be used to treat a disorder from another category due to comorbidity or lack of evidence about why a particular drug is effective in reducing symptoms
* In the US, about 1 in 6 adults reported taking prescription drugs to treat psychological disorders in 2019, with antidepressants being the most commonly prescribed (Terlizzi & Zablotsky, 2020)

**Alternative Biological Treatments**:

* For extreme treatment-resistant cases of psychological disorders
* **Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)**: Uses electrical current to produce a seizure, effective in some cases of severe depression, developed in Europe in the 1930s, improvements since negative public perception from Kesey's "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and film adaptation
* **Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)**: Uses a magnetic field to interrupt function in specific brain regions, used mainly to treat severe depression
* **Deep brain stimulation (DBS)**: Surgically implants electrodes deep within the brain to provide electric stimulation to specific brain structures, being tested for treating various psychological disorders like severe OCD, depression, and anorexia nervosa.

### 15.5 SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE INDICATES WHICH TREATMENTS ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE

**Evidence-Based Psychotherapies**:

* Important for safe and effective treatment of psychological disorders
* Some treatments lack scientific support or are even dangerous
* Rebirthing therapy, for example, has no scientific evidence supporting its benefits
* Critical thinking necessary to recognize flawed science and unsupported therapies
* **Dangers of unproven therapies**: "scared straight" programs, DARE, self-help books, etc.
* Tragic cases of harm or death from untested methods (rebirthing therapy)
* Empirical research is the only way to establish treatment validity

**Characteristics of Evidence-Based Psychological Treatments**:

1. **Tailored to specific disorders and symptoms**:
   - Asthma vs. broken leg analogy
   - Panic disorder vs. autism spectrum disorder
2. **Developed in laboratories by psychologists**:
   - Behavioral, cognitive, social psychologists
3. **Based on evidence of effectiveness**:
   - Not guided by a single theory about the cause of the disorder

**Determining Effectiveness of Psychological Treatments**:

1. Conduct empirical research
2. Compare treatment with control condition (helpful information, supportive listeners)
3. Use randomized clinical trials
4. Random assignment to conditions ensures comparability and controls for confounds
5. Most psychologists recommend evidence-based treatments

**Improving Mental Health**:

1. Acknowledge mental health issues
2. Seek treatment
3. **Practice positive thinking**: "I'm not better yet--but I will be"

### 15.8 ANXIETY AND OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDERS ARE BEST TREATED WITH COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY

**Anxiety Disorders**:

* Anxiety disorders include specific phobias, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder.
* CBT is the most effective treatment for nearly all anxiety disorders (Hofmann & Smits, 2008).
* CBT includes strategies to identify and change distorted beliefs and maladaptive thinking patterns.
* Exposure therapy is a key part of behavior therapies for anxiety disorders.
* Exposure helps the person learn new, nonthreatening associations with the feared stimulus or situation.
* Anti-anxiety drugs can provide short-term relief but have risks and limited long-term benefits.

**Specific Phobias**:

* Behavior techniques are the treatment of choice for specific phobias that develop without a traumatic event.
* Repeated exposure to the feared object over a single 3-hour period is an effective treatment.
* Systematic desensitization is a gradual form of exposure therapy where clients learn to relax while being exposed to increasingly anxiety-producing situations.

**Panic Disorder**:

* CBT can help break the learned association between physical symptoms of anxiety and feelings of impending doom.
* Cognitive restructuring helps clients react to panic attack symptoms rationally.
* Exposure treatment aims to break the conditioned link between a trigger symptom and a panic response.
* CBT is as effective as or more effective than medication for treating panic disorder (Schmidt & Keough, 2010).

**Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**:

* OCD is characterized by recurrent intrusive thoughts and compulsions.
* CBT is the best choice for treating OCD, although adding an antidepressant may bring additional benefit.
* Exposure and response prevention therapy exposes clients to anxiety-producing stimuli while preventing them from engaging in compulsive behaviors.
* The goal is to break the conditioned link between a particular stimulus and a compulsive behavior.
* CBT may be more effective than medication for treating OCD, especially over the long term (Foa et al., 2005).

### 15.9 MANY EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS

**Overview**: Depression is a common psychological disorder affecting adolescents and adults, with various effective treatments available. This summary covers psychotropic medications, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), phototherapy, regular aerobic exercise, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).

**Psychotropic Medications**:

* Antidepressants were first used to treat depression in the 1950s.
* Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed due to fewer side effects and effectiveness.
* Different antidepressants have varying efficacy, and physicians often use a trial-and-error approach for determining which medication works best for individual clients.
* Critics argue that the connection between depression and neurotransmitter imbalance is not definitive.

**Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**:

* CBT is as effective as antidepressants in treating depressive disorders.
* The cognitive distortion model suggests people become depressed due to negative thoughts about themselves, the situation, and the future.
* CBT aims to identify, reevaluate, and change negative thought patterns to improve mood and behavior.
* Combining CBT with antidepressant medication can be more effective than either approach alone.

**Phototherapy**:

* Effective for clients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a depressive disorder with a seasonal pattern.
* Involves exposure to high-intensity light sources for several hours each day to reduce symptoms of depression.

**Regular Aerobic Exercise**:

* Can help reduce symptoms and prevent recurrence of depression.
* Releases endorphins, causing an overall feeling of well-being.
* Regularizes bodily rhythms, improves self-esteem, and provides social support.
* Clients with depression may struggle to find the energy and motivation to begin an exercise regimen.

**Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)**:

* Effective for severely depressed clients who do not respond to conventional treatments.
* Works quickly compared to antidepressants, making it a preferred option for suicidal clients or pregnant women.
* Has limitations such as memory impairments and high relapse rates, often requiring repeated treatments.
* Performing ECT on the non-dominant hemisphere for language may reduce memory disruption.

### IMPACT LEARNING PAUSE

**Thinking Deeply About Psychological Treatments**

* **Tips for understanding sensitive psychological material**:
  * Elaborate on key concepts by explaining them to friends and family in your own words.
  * Listen to people's experiences and relate concepts to them.
  * Describe how concepts apply to real or fictional case studies.

**Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for Depression**

* Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) over left frontal regions of the brain reduces depression significantly.
* TMS is effective even for those who have not responded to antidepressants and can be administered outside hospital settings with minimal side effects.
* FDA approved TMS for severe major depressive disorder in clients not helped by traditional therapies.
* DBS might also be valuable for treating severe depression when all other treatments have failed.

**Mayberg's Study of Deep Brain Stimulation for Depression**

* **Hypothesis**: Deep brain stimulation of an area of the prefrontal cortex may alleviate depression.
* **Research Method**:
  * Participants underwent surgery to implant electrodes into a specific area of the prefrontal cortex.
  * **Results**: Some participants reported relief as soon as the electrodes were switched on, and two-thirds felt significantly better within months.
* **Conclusion**: DBS may be an especially effective method for clients with depression that is resistant to other treatments.

**CBT for Depression**

* CBT might be the treatment of choice for your brother due to its effectiveness in treating depressive disorders.

**Bipolar Disorders and Psychotropic Medications**

* Bipolar disorders are best treated with psychotropic medications that stabilize mood or reduce psychotic thoughts.
* Lithium, a naturally occurring mineral, is one of the first substances found to stabilize mood in bipolar disorders by modulating neurotransmitter levels.
* Quetiapine (Seroquel) is the most commonly prescribed drug for bipolar disorders due to its effectiveness in treating manic episodes and stabilizing moods.
* Combining lithium with quetiapine may improve treatment outcomes.
* Clients with bipolar disorder may also be prescribed antidepressants to manage symptoms of depression, but they must be used with caution as there is a risk of triggering mania.
* SSRIs are preferable to other antidepressants due to their lower risk of triggering mania.
* Compliance with drug therapy can be a problem for various reasons, including side effects and the desire to experience manic episodes.
* CBT can help clients stay on their medication regimens by providing psychological support and helping them understand the importance of treatment.

### 15.11 ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS ARE THE BEST TREATMENT FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA

**Historical Context**:
Before the introduction of medications, treatments for schizophrenia were limited, with lobotomy being a common procedure. However, it had little effect on the disorder and left patients with severe side effects. The discovery of psychotropic medications in the 1950s revolutionized the treatment of schizophrenia by reducing positive symptoms like delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech and behavior.

**Conventional (First-Generation) Antipsychotics**:
- Introduced in the 1950s
- Reduced positive symptoms of schizophrenia
- Improved prognosis for patients
- Left some clients with tardive dyskinesia, a permanent motor disorder causing involuntary movements
- Had little to no effect on negative symptoms like apathy and lack of emotion
- Significant side effects including motor effects resembling Parkinson's disease and irreversible tardive dyskinesia

**Atypical (Second-Generation) Antipsychotics**:
- Introduced in the late 1980s
- Act on different neurotransmitters than conventional antipsychotics
- Beneficial in treating both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia
- Fewer signs of tardive dyskinesia
- Safer than earlier atypical antipsychotics, which had serious side effects like seizures, heart rate problems, significant weight gain, and a risk of fatal reduction in white blood cells
- Newer atypical antipsychotics are the drug of choice for treating schizophrenia

**Behavior Therapy**:
- Combined with medication for optimal treatment of schizophrenia
- Helps clients develop social skills, emotional regulation, and predict the effects of their behavior in social situations
- Encourages generalization of learned skills to other environments
- Improves self-care skills like grooming, managing medications, and financial planning

**Comparison**:
1. **Neurotransmitter action**: Conventional antipsychotics act on dopamine D2 receptors, while atypical antipsychotics act on multiple neurotransmitters including serotonin and dopamine.
2. **Symptom reduction**: Atypical antipsychotics reduce both positive and negative symptoms more effectively than conventional antipsychotics.
3. **Side effects**: Conventional antipsychotics have significant motor side effects and the risk of tardive dyskinesia, while atypical antipsychotics have fewer side effects overall. However, earlier versions had serious side effects like seizures, heart rate problems, and a risk of fatal reduction in white blood cells. Newer atypical antipsychotics are safer.

**Behavior Therapy**:
- **Social skills training**: Teaches clients appropriate behavior in social situations
- **Emotion regulation**: Helps clients recognize social cues and predict the effects of their behavior in social situations
- **Self-care skills**: Improves grooming, managing medications, and financial planning
- **Cognitive skills training**: Less effective than social skills or self-care interventions for clients with schizophrenia.

### 15.12 DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOR THERAPY IS THE BEST TREATMENT FOR BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER

**Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)** is a highly effective treatment for individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Developed by Marsha Linehan in the 1980s, DBT is based on her personal experience with BPD and her subsequent goal to help those who struggle with self-destructive or suicidal tendencies.

**Background**:
- Marsha Linehan developed DBT after experiencing extreme social withdrawal, physical self-destructiveness, and recurrent thoughts of suicide.
- Diagnosed with schizophrenia, she underwent various treatments including electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and Freudian psychoanalysis, but found "radical acceptance" to be the most helpful in managing her disorder.
- Earned a PhD in psychology to help others with similar struggles.

**Components of DBT**:
1. **Dialectical approach**: Discussing conflicting ideas using logic and reasoning.
2. **Combines elements of**:
   - Behavior therapy
   - Cognitive therapy
   - Psychodynamic therapy
   - Mindfulness approach based on Eastern meditative practices
3. Clients attend both group and individual sessions.
4. Explicit roles for client and therapist.

**Three Phases of DBT**:

**Phase 1: Behavior Change**
- Targets most extreme and dysfunctional behaviors, such as self-harm and suicide threats/attempts.
- Replaces destructive behaviors with less harmful ones.
- Teaches problem-solving techniques and effective coping skills.
- Introduces mindfulness meditation to focus on the present and manage emotions.

**Phase 2: Emotion Regulation and Trauma Exploration**
- Helps clients explore past traumas underlying emotional problems.
- Processes painful emotions in a safe environment.
- Encourages acceptance of negative emotions rather than suppressing them.

**Phase 3: Self-Validation and Independence**
- Develops self-respect and independent problem solving.
- Reduces dependence on others for validation.
- Teaches skills to maintain healthy relationships and improve communication.

**Mindfulness Meditation in DBT**:
- Practicing mindfulness meditation helps people become happier, less anxious, and more engaged in their lives.
- Effective in treating various psychological disorders, including BPD.
- Clients learn to focus their attention on the present moment and cope with emotions without engaging in destructive behaviors.

### 15.13 ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO TREAT

* **Extremely difficult to treat due to various factors**: lying, disregard for others' feelings, present-focused behavior, manipulation of therapists
* Individuals with APD more interested in manipulating therapists than changing own behavior
* Numerous treatment approaches tried with limited success

**Treatment Approaches for Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD)**

* **Psychotropic Medications**:
  * **Stimulants**: short-term benefit, not long-term
  * **Anti-anxiety drugs**: lower hostility levels slightly
  * **Lithium**: shows promise in treating aggressive behavior of violent criminals with psychopathic traits
* **Psychotherapies**:
  * **Individual therapy sessions**: rarely produce change in antisocial behavior
  * **Behavior therapy approaches**: most effective when therapist controls reinforcement, client cannot leave treatment, and client is part of a group
  * **Operant procedures**: increase desirable behaviors through reinforcement
* **Cognitive Techniques**: show promise but no good evidence of long-lasting changes
* Improvement in behavior after age 40 for those with APD without psychopathic traits
  * **Reasons unknown**: reduction in biological drives, insight, or exhaustion
  * Criminal acts and imprisonment decrease, but more than half of individuals with psychopathy continue to be arrested after age 40

**Treating Disorders in Children and Adolescents**

* Estimated 12-20% of children and adolescents experience psychological disorders
* Early treatment beneficial for overcoming psychological disorders
* **Effective treatments**: psychotropic medications, cognitive therapy, behavior therapy

**Treatment Approaches for Children and Adolescents**

* **Psychotropic Medications**: effective for certain disorders like ADHD
* **Cognitive Therapy**: helps children and adolescents learn to identify and challenge negative thoughts and beliefs
* **Behavior Therapy**: teaches children and adolescents new skills and behaviors through reinforcement and modeling
* **Play Therapy**: beneficial for young children, uses play to help them express emotions and develop problem-solving skills
* **Group Therapy**: effective for adolescents, provides social support and opportunities to learn from peers

**Longitudinal Study on Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD)**

* Percentage of participants in prison within each group during each five-year period is shown in Figure 15.28
* After age 40, the percentage declined for those with APD
* **Most likely to be in prison**: before age 40 for individuals with APD

### 15.14 CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER BENEFIT FROM STRUCTURED BEHAVIOR THERAPY

**Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Treatment**:

1. **Challenges in Treating ASD**:
   * **Core symptoms**: impaired communication, restricted interests, deficits in social interaction
   * Extreme behaviors are hard to reduce due to limited effective reinforcers
   * Children with ASD are selective in attention and require generalization of skills

2. **Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA)**:
   * Developed by Ivar Lovaas in the 1980s
   * Based on operant conditioning principles
   * Intensive interaction between children and teachers/parents
   * Increases socially desired behaviors through rewards
   * Requires a minimum of 40 hours of treatment per week
   * Evidence shows success, particularly when started early in life
   * Improves IQ and allows entry into kindergarten for many children
   * **New category**: Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBI) builds on ABA
      * Applies developmental psychology to motivate and engage children
      * Encourages social engagement through joint attention, imitation, modeling, and taking turns
      * Uses child's natural environment for therapy
      * Positively reinforces desired behaviors and actions

3. **Biological Treatment**:
   * Brain dysfunction is known to cause ASD, but the nature of the dysfunction is unknown
   * Attempts to use medications have shown some improvements in behavior but more research needed
   * No controlled studies show effectiveness of alternative treatment approaches

### 15.15 CHILDREN WITH ADHD CAN BENEFIT FROM VARIOUS APPROACHES

**Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**

* Psychological disorder or troublesome behavior pattern?
* Long-term prognosis is uncertain, some outgrow it while others continue to experience the disorder throughout adolescence and adulthood
* Effective treatment early in life may be crucial due to increased risk for other psychiatric disorders and lower socioeconomic level

**Treatment Approaches for ADHD**

**Psychotropic Medications**

* Most common treatment for ADHD
* Central nervous system stimulants, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) or Adderall
* Affect multiple neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine
* Selectively stimulate activity in frontal lobe regions to help children focus and calm their behavior
* Decrease overactivity and distractibility, increase attention and ability to concentrate
* Improvements in positive behaviors and decrease negative behaviors
* **Side effects**: sleep problems, reduced appetite, body twitches, temporary growth slowing, risk of drug abuse
* Short-term benefits may not be maintained over the long term

**Behavior Therapy**

* Aims to use operant procedures to reinforce positive behaviors and ignore or punish problem behaviors
* Clear support for effectiveness based on 174 studies with over 2,000 research participants (Fabiano et al., 2009)
* Combine behavioral approaches with medication or replace medication when possible
* Medication used to gain control over behaviors, then behavior modification techniques taught and medication phased out or not used at all

**Why Stimulants Reduce ADHD Symptoms**

* Selectively stimulate activity in frontal lobe regions that help children focus their attention and calm their behavior
* Decrease overactivity and distractibility, increase attention and ability to concentrate
* Improvements in positive behaviors (happier, more adept socially, modestly more successful academically) and decrease negative behaviors (Figure 15.31a and b)

## APPENDIX A HOW CAN YOU UNDERSTAND DATA FROM PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH?

**Three Types of Studies in Psychology**

1. **Study 1**: Descriptive Research Method - Self-Reports
2. **Study 2**: Correlational Research Method
3. **Study 3**: Experimental Research Method

**Descriptive Statistics**

* Summarize the basic patterns in research data
* Provide information about typical outcomes and variability

**Measures of Central Tendency**

* **Mean**: arithmetic average (sensitive to extreme values)
* **Median**: middle value (not affected by extreme values)
* **Mode**: most frequent value

**Example Study 1**: Research on Study Techniques

* Descriptive research method
* Self-reports from 11 participants about study technique usage
* **Central tendency measures**: mean, median, mode
* **Variability measures**: range, standard deviation

**Measures of Variability**

* **Range**: difference between largest and smallest values
* **Standard deviation**: average distance from the mean

**Impact on Your Life**

* Understanding central tendency and variability can help in various situations, such as salary negotiation
* **Mean vs. median**: choose the appropriate measure based on data distribution

### A.2 RESEARCH DATA CAN REVEAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN VARIABLES

**Correlations**: A statistical method used in research to examine the relationship between two variables. Researchers use descriptive statistics, including scatterplots and correlation coefficients, to summarize the direction and strength of the relationship.

**Scatterplots**: Graphical representation of data obtained for each participant in a study, where the scores for both variables are plotted on the same graph. Scatterplots help identify the pattern of the relationship between two variables.

* **Positive correlation (r > 0)**: Two variables change in the same direction. In a scatterplot, data points lie along a diagonal line from the lower left to the upper right. The correlation coefficient is positive and ranges from 0 to +1.
* **Negative correlation (r < 0)**: Two variables change in opposite directions. In a scatterplot, data points lie along a diagonal line from the upper left to the lower right. The correlation coefficient is negative and ranges from 0 to -1.
* **Zero correlation (r = 0)**: No relationship exists between the two variables. In a scatterplot, data points are scattered randomly throughout the graph.

**Correlation Coefficient**: A numerical value that describes the direction and strength of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to +1, with values closer to either extreme indicating a stronger correlation. The coefficient provides information about the degree to which one variable can be used to predict the value of another variable.

**Directionality Problem**: A limitation of correlational research where it is unclear whether one variable causes the other or if they influence each other reciprocally.

**Third Variable Problem**: A limitation of correlational research where there may be an unmeasured factor influencing both variables, making it difficult to determine causality.

**Example Study 2**: An investigation into the relationship between using repeated practice and achieving higher exam scores. The study found a strong positive correlation (r = +0.88) between the two variables, suggesting that students who use more repeated practice tend to earn better grades on exams.

**Application**:

a. **Zero correlation**: Spending more time driving decreases tire tread and new tires have no relationship with less tire wear.
b. **No clear answer**: Some shorter people may get higher grades due to other factors, such as motivation or study habits, while some taller people may struggle academically for various reasons. The correlation is not definitive.
c. **Positive correlation**: Warmer weather increases ice cream sales and the correlation is positive because both variables change in the same direction.

### A.3 RESEARCH DATA REVEAL WHETHER RESULTS ARE MEANINGFUL OR JUST DUE TO CHANCE

**Topic**: **Inferential Statistics**: Determining Whether Study Results are Meaningful or Due to Chance

**Key Concepts**: Inferential statistics, statistical significance, experimental research methods, hypothesis testing, error bars, descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients

**Learning Goal**: Explain how inferential statistics help researchers determine whether observed differences between groups in an experiment are meaningful or just due to chance.

**Background**: Researchers use inferential statistics to investigate the likelihood that study results are not due to chance but rather reflect real differences in populations. Inferential statistics are particularly important when using experimental research methods, where the researcher manipulates variables and compares the results between an experimental group and a control group.

**Inferential Statistics**:
1. **Determine Statistical Significance**: Researchers use inferential statistics to determine if the differences observed between groups are statistically significant. This means that the results would occur by chance less than 5% of the time (p < 0.05).
2. **Comparing Data Between Groups**: Inferential statistics compare data from two or more groups in an experiment to see if there is a meaningful difference.
3. **Error Bars**: Error bars represent the uncertainty in the mean for each group and help researchers visualize whether differences between means are statistically significant.

**Example Study 3**: **In this study, students were split into two groups**: one that used repeated practice more frequently (100% condition) and another that used it less frequently (50% condition). The results showed that participants in the experimental group had significantly higher exam scores than those in the control group.

**Key Takeaways**:
- Inferential statistics help researchers determine whether observed differences between groups are meaningful or due to chance.
- Statistical significance is a measure of the likelihood that research results are not due to chance.
- Error bars represent the uncertainty in the mean for each group and help researchers visualize whether differences between means are statistically significant.
- Repeated practice is an effective study technique that has been shown to improve learning and grades.
