## PART 1 FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS
## Chapter 1 Attachment Research A History of Ideas

The understanding of the phenomena of attachment has evolved through several seminal ideas, which are presented below with their historical context. These ideas have contributed to the development of a comprehensive treatment model and methods.

**Maternal Deprivation**

1. **Harry Harlow (Bellevue Hospital, 1930s)**: Observed infants' disrupted attachment processes in institutional settings and highlighted their deleterious effects. Infants failed to thrive, showed developmental delays, and lacked the ability to form consistent bonds with caregivers.
2. **Loretta Bender (Bellevue Hospital, 1930s)**: Noted emotional deprivation's contribution to the development of psychopathic personalities in children who experienced a lack of interaction and stimulation.
3. **René Spitz (Hospitalism, 1945)**: Documented the effects of extended institutionalization on infants, including arrested physical, cognitive, and emotional development, and the emergence of anaclitic depression.
4. **John Bowlby and James Robertson**: Studied the effects of maternal separation on children during World War II, focusing on hospitalized children and those in foster care. Identified stages of protest, despair, and detachment following separation from parents.
5. **David Levy (1930s)**: Observed children who experienced significant disruptions in parental care during their formative years and found they had difficulty forming attachments to subsequent foster or adoptive parents. Described their symptoms as primary affect hunger, which includes the need for the full spectrum of human feelings.

**Maternal Deprivation and Its Effects on Children in Institutional and Foster Care**

* Researchers shifted focus from separation to effects of maternal deprivation during separation
* **Karen (1998)**: Calamitous effects when child never develops true attachment, no alternative mother figure, or repeated losses lead to bitterness and mistrust

**Maternal Deprivation: Seminal Ideas**

* Bowlby (1951) consolidated research findings on maternal deprivation for WHO
* Quality of parental care in early years crucial for mental health
* Warm, intimate, continuous relationship with mother essential for mental health
* **Maternal deprivation**: too little experience of this relationship adversely affects child's mental health

**Maternal Deprivation and Home Disruption**

* Separation most obvious cause but not only instance of maternal deprivation
* Child living with an unable-to-provide care mother may also experience it
* Criticized early child guidance concept of "broken home" – disrupted attachment bond is essential cause of mental health problems

**Problems in Parent-Child Dynamic**

* Unconsciously rejecting attitude by parent
* Excessive demand for love and reassurance by parent
* Parent gets unconscious vicarious gratification from child's acting out

**Findings on Maternal Deprivation**

* **Bakwin, Bender, Spitz, Levy**: causative factor is maternal deprivation
* **Delinquent and psychopathic children**: frequent or prolonged separations before 2.5 years without substitute figure available
* Prolonged deprivation of young child of maternal care may have grave effects on character and future.

### The Development of the Concept of the Attachment Bond

* John Bowlby's discovery of Konrad Lorenz's work on imprinting in ducks (1937) led him to believe that human infant-mother attachment follows similar patterns.
* Imprinting in animals, such as ducks, occurs independently of parental feeding and results in a strong bond between the baby and mother.
* Bowlby studied human infant-mother interactions to identify instinctual patterns, which he called "attachment behaviors."
* **Attachment behaviors include**: rooting, sucking, grasping, looking, reaching, following, calling, crying, babbling, smiling, and protesting when left alone.
* The goal of attachment behavior is proximity to the caregiver, a fundamental form of behavior distinct from feeding and sex.
* Harlow's research on attachment in primates (1958) provided evidence that soft contact is more important than feeding for attachment development.
* Attachment is highly specific and directed towards one or a few individuals, primarily associated with forming, maintaining, reacting to disruption of, and reestablishing attachment bonds.
* Infant attachment serves the function of maintenance of proximity, which promotes protection and survival of the species.

**Stages of Attachment Development in Human Infants**

1. **Indiscriminate Orientation**: Newborns show no preference for any particular caregiver.
2. **Orientation toward a Specific Caregiver**: Between 6-18 months, infants begin to form a strong attachment bond with their primary caregiver.
3. **Proximity-Maintaining Behavior**: Infants exhibit behaviors that keep them close to the caregiver for comfort and security.
4. **Goal-Corrected Partnership**: In this final stage, both infant and mother engage in goal-corrected behavior, adjusting their actions to meet each other's needs and goals.

**Attachment vs. Dependence**

* Attachment is the innate drive for maintaining proximity to a specific caregiver, while dependence refers to the need for support from others.
* Dependence diminishes as individuals grow older, but attachment remains constant throughout life.
* Attachment is essential for emotional security and healthy development.

**Interplay between Attachment and Exploratory Behavior**

* Securely attached infants exhibit both attachment and exploratory behaviors.
* When an infant experiences a threat or becomes alarmed, they may display attachment behaviors such as proximity-seeking.
* The mother's responsiveness to the infant's attachment behavior plays a crucial role in strengthening the bond.
* Exploratory behavior is antithetical to attachment behavior but can be reactivated when the infant feels safe and secure with their caregiver.

### Patterns of Attachment

**Mary Ainsworth's Attachment Theory**

- Influenced by William Blatz's personality theory, which emphasized emotional security from parents
- **Concept of secure base**: caregiver provides stability and consistency for exploration and security
- **Securely attached infants exhibit specific behaviors**: smiling, cooing, crying, greeting, following, searching, burying face in mother's lap, seeking proximity when anxious
- Observed attachment behaviors during her research projects in Uganda (1954) and Baltimore (1960s)

**Research in Uganda (1954)**

- Developed concept of secure base based on observations of maternal behaviors and infant reactions
- **Five phases of attachment development**: undiscriminating, differential responsiveness, secure base behavior, active initiative, stranger anxiety
- Noted nonattached and insecurely attached infants

**Research in Baltimore (1960s)**

- Observed cultural differences in parenting and attachment behaviors between Ugandan and American infants
- Developed Strange Situation method to study patterns of attachment in unfamiliar settings

**Strange Situation Method**

- Standardized laboratory paradigm for studying infant–caregiver attachment
- **Includes eight distinct episodes**: introduction, mother–infant interaction, stranger enters, first separation, first reunion, second separation, second reunion

**Influence on Therapy and Subsequent Research**

- Focused on therapist providing secure base for patient's exploration in psychotherapy
- Set foundation for understanding role of attachment in human development and relationships

**The Strange Situation Procedure**

- Developed by Ainsworth et al. (1978) to assess infant attachment behavior and exploratory behavior in various conditions.
- Designed to detect individual differences in patterns of attachment.
- Hypothesized that infants would show low attachment behavior and high exploratory behavior with a secure base (mother present), and high attachment behavior and low exploratory behavior during separation and reunion.

**Study Overview**

- Systematic controlled laboratory study using the Strange Situation Procedure.
- Observed 106 white, middle-class one-year-old infants and their mothers.
- **Goals**: assess distress upon being separated, infant responses to a stranger, and interplay between attachment and exploratory behavior in an unfamiliar situation.

**Procedures and Behaviors Observed**

- Infants and mothers observed through one-way mirror.
- **Twelve specific behaviors coded**: locomotion, body movement, body posture, hand movements, visual regard, location, adult contact behavior, baby contact behavior, crying, vocalization, oral behavior, and smiling.
- **Four dimensions of interactive sequences coded**: proximity-and contact-seeking behavior, contact-maintaining behavior, avoidance, and resistance.

**Normative Results**

- **Confirmed main hypotheses**: exploratory behavior high with a secure base, attachment behavior low; attachment behavior activated during separation, absence, or reunion at the expense of exploratory behavior.

**Attachment Patterns**

- Hypothesized that differences in early social experiences lead to differences in the development and organization of attachment behavior.
- **Discriminant function analysis revealed three major patterns of attachment behavior**: Group A (avoidance), Group B (secure), and Group C (ambivalent).

**Group A Infants**

- Avoidance of mother, especially during reunion episodes.
- Significant resistance to physical contact with the mother.
- Strong exploratory behavior.
- Heightened exploratory behavior and inhibited attachment behavior.

**Group B Infants (Securely Attached)**

- Greater proximity-seeking and contact-seeking toward the mother than the stranger.
- Healthy protest behavior after the mother left.
- Continued exploratory behavior in the presence of the stranger.
- Less crying and more exploratory behavior when left alone.
- Balanced interplay of exploratory and attachment behavior.

**Group C Infants**

- Conspicuous contact-and interaction-resisting behavior, especially during reunion episodes.
- Significant resistance to contact with the stranger.
- Chronic anxiety in relation to the mother.
- Inhibited exploratory behavior and heightened attachment behavior.

**Subgroups within Each Group**

- Data allowed initial classification of infants along a continuum within each group.

**Attachment Classification**

* **Ainsworth et al. (1978) identified three patterns of attachment**: Secure (B), Anxious-Avoidant (A), and Anxious-Resistant or Ambivalent (C) based on infant behavior in the Strange Situation (SS) test.
* **Secure Attachment (B)**
  * B1 and B2 infants are subgroups of secure attachment, with B1 showing less proximity-seeking in the second reunion episode.
  * Mothers of securely attached infants were sensitive to their babies' signals, accepting, cooperative, and accessible.
* **Anxious-Avoidant Attachment (A)**
  * A1 infants showed less proximity-seeking and stronger avoidance than A2 infants in reunion episodes.
  * Mothers of anxious-avoidant infants were more rejecting and interfering.
* **Anxious-Resistant or Ambivalent Attachment (C)**
  * C1 babies showed strong resistance in reunion episodes, and their mothers were interfering and controlling.
  * C2 babies were passive with weak exploratory behavior and mothers were inaccessible and ignoring.

**Home Study**

* A subsample of infants was observed at home for approximately 50 weeks using the same coding system as the SS.
* Securely attached infants (B) showed less crying, positive response to reunion, frequent initiation of close contact, and better communication skills in their natural environment.
* Anxious-avoidant (A) and anxious-resistant or ambivalent (C) infants also displayed the same patterns at home as in the SS.

**Maternal Behavior and Attachment**

* Ainsworth et al. observed maternal behavior to understand its association with attachment patterns.
* Maternal responsiveness to crying, acknowledgement upon entering the room, quality of touch, physical contact, face-to-face interactions, verbal commands, discipline-oriented interventions, feeding practices, and general maternal characteristics were assessed.

**Findings from Home Study**

1. Securely attached infants (B) had mothers who were more affectionate during physical contact, tender when holding their babies, responsive to crying, sensitive, accepting, cooperative, and accessible.
2. Anxious-avoidant infants (A) had mothers who were rejecting, showed less positive feelings, more anger toward their babies, less affectionate in picking up their babies, abrupt and interfering when picking up their babies, gave more verbal commands, and delivered more physical interventions for discipline.
3. Anxious-resistant or ambivalent infants (C) had mothers who showed significant delay or unresponsiveness to their crying, were involved in routine activities while holding their babies, and struggled when feeding them. Overall, C mothers were notably insensitive to their infant's signals.

**Changes in Attachment and Exploratory Behavior from Ages One to Four**

* Two-year-olds showed stronger proximity-seeking but did not need to maintain contact as strongly as one-year-olds.
* Three-year-olds were less disturbed by separation episodes and had a high level of exploratory behavior throughout the SS.
* Four-year-olds were even less disturbed by separation than three-year-olds and had stronger exploratory behavior than three-year-olds.
* The goal-corrected partnership between mother and child increased from age one to age four.

### Disorganized Attachment

- A fourth primary classification group identified by Ainsworth and her associates and later researchers
- **Children did not fit the three patterns of attachment**: avoidant, secure, and ambivalent
- Initially seen as unclassifiable and their data ignored
- In the 1970s, Main developed a scale to assess disorganized attachment behaviors in babies during the Strange Situation (SS)
- Discovery led researchers to reexamine over 200 unclassifiable cases from previous SS studies
- Established criteria for a fourth primary classification called disorganized/disoriented (D)
- Interrater reliability for identifying disorganized attachment from the SS is approximately 80%

**Characteristics of Disorganized Attachment**

- Lacking a coherent and consistent strategy for dealing with separation stress in the SS
- Contradictory attachment behaviors (avoidant and ambivalent) over time or at the same time
- Misdirected and interrupted movements, mistimed and anomalous behaviors, freezing, pervasive indices of fear and apprehension, and outright signs of disorganization and disorientation

**Crittenden's Interpretation of Disorganized Behaviors**

- Crittenden suggested that there is an underlying organization to the "disorganized" child's behavior
- In maltreated children, behavior labeled as disorganized represents a separate pattern or another organization of behaviors
- Older children integrate this information into their set of expectations and develop an organized pattern of responding
- Labeled this emerging organization "A/C," where any subtype of the A and C patterns can be combined
- Later refined and expanded to describe an "AC" pattern, in which the A and C strategies are blended and simultaneously manifest

**Main's Interpretation of Disorganized Behaviors**

- Main sees these behaviors as indicating a lack of a consistent and coherent attachment strategy
- Differences between interpretations are based on what constitutes organized vs. disorganized behavior and populations studied

**Consequences of Attachment Trauma**

- Fonagy suggests that the consequences of attachment trauma can be seen as adaptation (Crittenden's perspective) or absence of an organized strategy (Main's perspective)

**Limitations of the Traditional CC Category**

- Crittenden and Landini argue that having only one category for all cases of severe problems limits the power of the Main and Goldwyn Adult Attachment Interview classification method to address individual differences in psychopathology
- Our approach is to expand and refine the CC scoring system rather than dropping it.

**Frightening and Frightened Maternal Behavior**

- **Disorganized attachment presents an impossible dilemma for babies**: the source of proximity and contact is also the source of fear. (Main)
- **Two contributing factors to disorganized attachment**:
  - Frightening and frightened maternal behavior (Main, Hesse)
  - Extreme misattunement and disrupted affective communication (Lyons-Ruth & Jacobvitz)
- Babies normally seek contact and proximity from their mothers for comfort when frightened.
- In disorganized babies, the mother is the source of fear, leading to a conflictual state called "fear without solution." (Main)
- Dissociative behavior in mothers can also lead to disorganized attachment. (Schuengel et al., Main & Hesse)
- Mothers with unresolved trauma or loss are more likely to engage in frightening/frightened behaviors and dissociation. (Hesse & van IJzendoorn)

**Child Behaviors Triggering Unresolved Trauma or Loss**

- Particular child behaviors can trigger unresolved trauma or loss in parents, leading to fear and dissociation.
- Children with disorganized attachment exhibit a wider range of observable dissociative behaviors and experiences throughout childhood and adolescence. (Carlson, Liotti)
- Controlling behavior is common among children with disorganized attachment. (Main & Cassidy)
  - Manifested as manipulative, bossy, aggressive behavior or compulsive caregiving.

**Stability of Attachment Patterns Over Time**

- Bowlby considered attachment patterns from 12 to 18 months a property of the relationship.
- Through internalization and the formation of "internal working models," attachment patterns become relatively stable over childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. (Bowlby)
- **Longitudinal studies have shown high stability of attachment patterns over time**:
  - **Secure attachment**: 75% from 18 to 24 months, 75% to 77% from 18 months to 20 years.
  - **Disorganized attachment**: 67% from 12 to 18 months, 81% from 18 to 24 months, 72% to 77% from 18 months to 20 years. (Solomon & George, Barnett et al., Vondra et al.)
- The Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children aimed to investigate the stability of attachment patterns over time, effects on personality development, and parenting style's impact on attachment status. (Sroufe & Waters)

### Attachment and the Organization of Development

* **Minnesota Longitudinal Study** (Sroufe et al., 2005)
  * Changing patterns over time
    + Secure children: less distressed by separation, less need for physical contact, more autonomous, more comfortable around peers as they grow older.
  * Organizational perspective on development
    + Development defined by changes in organization of behavior over time
    + Organization of behavior central to individual differences
  * Early experience plays a critical role in the development of the person
* **Study Areas**
  + Prenatal factors
  + Being born into poverty
  + Age-by-age assessment
  + Comprehensive measures across domains
  + Normal versus maladaptive development
  + Developmental context
  + Assessment of early relationships
* **Participants**
  + 179 young, expectant mothers of low socioeconomic status
  + High-risk sample: alcoholism, domestic violence, child abuse, maltreatment common in their homes
* **Assessments**
  + Strange Situation (SS) at 12 months and 18 months
    - Classified infants as resistant (ambivalent), avoidant, or disorganized (assessed post hoc from videotapes)
  + Adult Attachment Interview at age 19 and 26
* **Findings at 12 Months**
  + 22% of babies were classified as resistant
  + 20% were classified as avoidant.

The Minnesota Longitudinal Study, led by Sroufe and his associates, investigated the organization of development from birth to adulthood using an 'organizational perspective.' This approach defines development based on changes in the organization of behavior over time, with organization of behavior central to individual differences. Early experiences play a critical role in shaping the person. The study addressed seven areas: prenatal factors, being born into poverty, age-by-age assessment, comprehensive measures across domains, normal versus maladaptive development, developmental context, and assessment of early relationships.

The study included 179 young mothers of low socioeconomic status, many from high-risk backgrounds with alcoholism, domestic violence, child abuse, and maltreatment. The researchers assessed physical abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect, psychological unavailability, and verbal abuse in this sample.

Infants' attachment was assessed using the Strange Situation (SS) at 12 months and again at 18 months. At 12 months, 22% of babies were classified as resistant (Ainsworth's ambivalent), and 20% were classified as avoidant. The category of disorganized attachment was not available at the time but was assessed post hoc from videotapes of the SS.

The Adult Attachment Interview was administered to participants at age 19 and again at age 26. At 12 months, the Strange Situation assessment replicated earlier findings, with secure children showing less distress during separation, less need for physical contact, more autonomous exploratory behavior, and greater comfort around peers as they grew older. The organizational perspective on development emphasizes that these patterns of attachment change form as a child grows older.

### Bowlby and Ainsworth:

**Bowlby and Ainsworth's Hypotheses**:

- Longitudinal study affirmed Bowlby's hypothesis that differences in quality of care lead to differences in attachment relationship quality (Sroufe et al., 2005)
- Supported Ainsworth's findings on caregiver responsivity and attachment relationship quality in the first year

**Study Overview**:

- Longitudinal study in a research preschool setting
- Focus on effect of early attachment status on development of personality

**Developmental Stages**:

- Guided self-regulation (toddler years)
- Self-reliance (preschool years)
- Competency (school years)
- Individuation (adolescence)
- Emancipation (early adulthood)

**Attachment Patterns in Preschool**:

- **Secure**: more ego-resilient, higher self-esteem, positive peer relationships
- **Avoidant**:
  - Bullies
  - Shy loners
  - Daydreamers
- **Ambivalent**:
  - Impulsive child with poor concentration
  - Fearful, clingy child

**Attachment in Adulthood**:

- Securely attached children likely to grow into secure adults
- Insecure children likely to retain status unless exposed to healthy attachment figures
- Insecure attachment correlated with later development of depression

**Behavioral Consequences**:

- Insecure children who were frequently distracted from play behavior as infants more likely to show attention deficits as adults
- Ambivalently/resistantly attached children significantly more likely to manifest anxiety disorders
- Avoidantly attached children significantly more likely to have externalizing problems and conduct disorders
- Disorganized children had a wide range of dissociative experiences but tended to grow out of them unless abused, in which case they continued to manifest significant dissociative experiences as adults

**Impact of Early Disorganized Attachment**:

- Strongly correlated with emergence of psychopathology in early adulthood
- History of disorganized attachment and subsequent sexual abuse significantly correlated with self-injurious behavior.

### Counterpoints

**Counterpoints to Attachment Theory**

* Criticisms and challenges to the findings and interpretations of attachment theory

**Michael Lamb et al. (1984)**

* Small sample size in Ainsworth's research with the Strange Situation (SS)
* Concerns about making generalizations based on patterns of attachment
* Lack of use of videorecordings for observations
* Findings from SS have been replicated or partially replicated despite these criticisms

**Jerome Kagan (1984)**

* Believes effects of parenting on child development are unstable and transient, not lasting
* Challenges existence of stable patterns of attachment and validity of SS in assessing such patterns
* Asserts organized states of mind do not emerge based on quality of early attachment relationships
* Primary factors in development of personality are hereditary, including temperament

**Stella Chess and Alexander Thomas (1982)**

* New York Longitudinal Study investigating effects of early infant temperament on subsequent development
* **Infants classified into four groups based on temperament**: difficult, slow-to-warm, easy, cannot classify
* Temperament made significant contribution to development, parenting style did not significantly correlate with ease or difficulty
* Notion of "poor fit" between parent and infant temperaments

**Responses to Kagan and Chess**

* **Sroufe's Minnesota 28 Longitudinal Study**: included data on heredity, temperament, and quality of early attachment
* Quality of early attachment and maternal behavior accounted for greater portion of variance than temperament
* **Belsky and Isabella (1988)**: mother's temperament, not infant's, correlated with infant's pattern of attachment in SS
* Both temperament and early attachment relationship contribute to later development and emergence of psychopathology in adulthood

**Robust Findings on Attachment Patterns**

* **Four prototypical child patterns of attachment**: secure, avoidant, ambivalent/resistant, disorganized
* Remain relatively stable across time unless altered by unusual life circumstances such as divorce, family dysfunction, or extreme stress

### The Role of the Father

**The Role of the Father in Attachment**

- ***Main and Weston's Study (1981)***: Comparable rates of secure and insecure attachment to both mothers and fathers. No significant correlation between attachment to mothers and fathers.
  - Secure attachment towards one parent but not the other possible.

- ***Goossens and van IJzendoorn's Meta-Analysis (1990)***:
  - Small but significant effect size (0.13) for paternal sensitivity and secure attachment.
  - Smaller effect size than maternal sensitivity and secure attachment.

**Factors Affecting Father as a Secure Attachment Figure**

- ***Father's Involvement***: Many fathers are less involved with their babies than mothers.
- ***Active Involvement***: When fathers are actively involved in positive ways, they easily become secure attachment figures.

**Differences in Father and Mother Roles**

- ***Mother's Role***: Focused on infant's proximity-and contact-seeking behaviors.
- ***Father's Role***: Focused on encouraging exploratory behavior.

**Father's Role in Secure Attachment and Quality of Toddler Play**

- ***Positive Feelings and Priorities***: Fathers who express positive feelings about infants and prioritize time spent with them have more secure infants.
- ***Consistent Findings***: Father's role in the quality of toddler play is associated with father–child secure attachment.
  - Belsky, Gilstrap, & Rovine (1984)
  - Grossmann & Grossmann (1991)
- ***Howes' Summary (1999)***: "Fathers who express more positive feelings about their infants and their role as parents, and who assign a high priority to time spent with the infants, have more secure infants" (p. 679).

### Cross-Cultural Studies of Attachment Patterns and Maternal Behavior

* Interest in universality of attachment patterns began early in the field
* Cross-cultural study started with Ainsworth's research in Uganda and Baltimore, identifying three main attachment patterns (A, B, C)

**Ainsworth's Research**:

* Ugandan children more used to constant maternal presence
* Secure attachment observed in both groups
* Subsequent cross-cultural studies conducted

**Gusii Tribe, Kenya**:

* Older children care for babies during the day
* Mothers provide nighttime and physical care
* 61% secure attachment to mothers, 54% to non-maternal caregivers (no insecure classifications)
* Secure attachment protects babies from physical danger
* **Differences observed in SS behavior**: handshake greeting, exploratory behavior

**Hausa Tribe, Nigeria**:

* Men have multiple wives, children have several caregivers
* Babies remain close to caregivers due to safety concerns
* Secure attachment demonstrated to multiple caregivers

**Dogon Culture, Mali**:

* High infant mortality rate, breast-feeding on demand, grandparents and siblings serve as caregivers
* Total of 69% secure, 8% resistant, 0% avoidant, 23% disorganized (possibly due to unresolved loss in mothers)

**!Kung Bushmen and Efe Rainforest Pygmies**:

* Children spend more time with peers as they grow older
* Dense social networks facilitate secure attachment and healthy peer adjustment
* Preference for biological mothers, but multiple caregivers present

**Israeli Kibbutz Children**:

* Sleep apart from parents in communal setting
* Secure attachment lower (56%) than non-kibbutz Israeli children (75%), Western studies (65%-70%)
* Ambivalent/resistant overrepresented, avoidant underrepresented
* Non-kibbutz Israeli children raised by parents show high rates of secure attachment (80%)

**Northern Germany**:

* High value placed on early independence
* Two-thirds of sample insecure, half avoidant
* Parents become less responsive to children around six months old
* Second study found comparable rates to American studies

**China**:

* One-child policy, interdependence favored over independence
* **Hu and Meng's study**: 68% secure, 16% avoidant, 16% resistant
* Avoidant babies indifferent to mothers during reunion episodes
* Mothers of avoidant babies less involved in caregiving
* Rural mothers work long hours, children show high rates of avoidant attachment

**Japan**:

* Encouraging dependence on mother
* Secure attachment distribution similar to Western studies (61% securely attached)
* Mothers who feel supported by husbands more likely to raise securely attached children

**Russia**:

* **Family-reared infants in St. Petersburg**: only 6.2% securely attached
* Unstable and threatening social environment may impact attachment development

### Intergenerational Transmission

**Intergenerational Transmission of Attachment**

* Attachment status tends to be transmitted down through generations (Main et al., 1985; Fonagy et al., 1991; Bowlby, 1988)

**Parent-Child Attachment Correlation**

* Strong correlation between parent's attachment pattern on the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) and baby's pattern in the Strange Situation (SS) procedure
* Main found that a mother's description of her relationships with her parents during childhood significantly predicted her child's attachment pattern (Bowlby, 1988)

**Three-Generation Study**

* Grandmother's attachment status on the AAI significantly predicted both mother and mother's baby's attachment patterns (Benoit & Parker, 1994; Hesse, 1999; Wallin, 2007)

**Transmission Gap**

* Van IJzendoorn (1995) noted that a "transmission gap" remains due to lack of explanation for how parent's attachment pattern becomes child's

**Unresolved Trauma or Loss**

* Main and her associates discovered temporary, event-specific disorganization in adults with unresolved trauma or loss (Main & Goldwyn, 1994)
* **Unresolved status associated with**:
  * Extreme, persistent irrational beliefs about the loss or trauma
  * Severe, persistent clinical symptoms of trauma or grief
  * Dissociative compartmentalization
* Unresolved adults often have deficits in metacognitive monitoring (Main & Hesse, 1990)
* Unresolved status for trauma or loss in adult parents significantly associated with disorganized attachment in their babies (Main & Hesse, 1990, 1992)
* Triggers of mental and emotional states associated with unresolved trauma or loss can negatively affect parent's responsiveness towards the child
* Unresolved status also associated with frightening and frightened ways towards the baby
* **Cumulative effect**: vulnerability of the child to developing multiple, contradictory internal working models (IWMs) and disorganized attachment (Sroufe, 2005; Stovall-McClough & Cloitre, 2006)

**Base Rates for Adult Attachment Pattern Classifications**

* Bakermans-Kranenburg and van IJzendoorn (2009) examined over 200 studies assessing various populations with the AAI
* **Combined results from North American mothers without identified clinical histories**: 58% secure (F), 23% dismissing (Ds), 19% anxious-preoccupied (E)
* **Using a four-category classification system, with unresolved (U) and cannot classify (CC) categories combined**: 56% F, 16% Ds, 9% E, 18% U/CC
* North American fathers' distribution not significantly different from mothers for the three-category classification but significantly more dismissing when U/CC is included (24% vs. 16%)
* European studies did not differ statistically from North American findings when using the three-category differentiation, but adding U/CC resulted in a slightly higher rate of dismissing attachment
* Significant deviation from base rate norm in clinical populations and some countries (Bakermans-Kranenburg & van IJzendoorn, 2009; Pleshkova & Muhamedrahimov, 2010)

### The Organization of States of Mind: Internal Working Models

* John Bowlby was influenced by Lorenz's work on animals' mental representations of their environment and began to consider humans' internal maps for attachment behavior.
* Bowlby adopted the term "internal working model" (IWM) from information-processing theory to refer to infants' construction of an inner model of their relational reality.
* IWMs are key features of an individual's notion of attachment figures and self.
* Secure IWMs are flexible, adaptable, and relatively resistant to change, while insecure IWMs are more rigid, distorted, contradictory, and relatively resistant to change.
* **Insecure IWMs can cause entire behavioral systems to become deactivated (avoidant babies**: attachment behavior, exploratory behavior for resistant babies).
* Through exposure to a healthy attachment figure or effective attachment-based psychotherapy, an insecure IWM can be changed into a stable, secure IWM, which is referred to as the establishment of "earned security."

**Mary Main's Work on Internal Working Models**

* Influenced by linguistics, Mary Main saw that differences in attachment behavior were a reflection of different patterns of cognitive organization.
* Secure versus various types of insecure attachment organizations can best be understood as terms referring to particular types of internal working models that direct not only feelings and behavior but also attention, memory, and cognition.
* Individual differences in internal working models are related to individual differences in patterns of language and structures of mind.

**Patricia Crittenden's Dynamic-Maturational Model (DMM) of Attachment and Adaptation**

* Patricia Crittenden, influenced by Mary Ainsworth, developed a way of understanding attachment patterns that emphasizes consideration of the organization of mind in response to experience.
* The DMM approach focuses on children's experiences of danger and threat and the information-processing strategies for coping that develop over the course of early and later childhood through the interplay of maturation and experiences with attachment figures.
* Variation in attachment behavior reflects variation in patterns of information processing, which underlie the child's attempts to cope with danger and threat.
* The DMM brings attention to these attachment-related patterns of information processing, which Crittenden's assessment methods attempt to specify.
* The two primary functions of attachment are protection from harm (or death) in order to ensure reproduction.

**Dynamic-Maturational Model of Attachment and Adaptation (DMM)**

- **Defines attachment as three interconnected components**:
  - Relationships focused on protection and comfort
  - Patterns of mental processing of information about danger and sexual opportunity
  - Strategies for self-protection, reproduction, and protection of progeny

**Attachment in DMM**:

- Not a stable property but a strategy or range of strategies
- **Goal is to preserve central functions of attachment**: self-protection
- Maladaptive behavior results from earlier attempts to protect oneself and one's progeny

**Processing Information**:

- When parents do not provide adequate protection, child processes experience based on their zone of proximal development
- Distortions in processing preserve function under conditions of threat
- **Two primary forms of information-processing distortion**:
  - Omitting affective information and privileging cognitive information
  - Omitting cognitive information and privileging affective information

**Patterns of Attachment**:

- Reflect learned patterns of mentally managing cognitive and affective information
- Specific strategies for coping, eliciting caregiving, reducing rejection or harm
- Repeated over time create dispositional representations (DRs) reflecting interpersonal expectations

**Dispositional Representations (DRs)**:

- More precise than Bowlby's internal working models
- Emphasizes transient, in-process quality of representation
- Lead to relatively consistent patterns of attachment behavior and response

**Expanded Classification System**:

- Based on Ainsworth's distinction among avoidant (A), balanced or secure (B), and ambivalent (C) strategies
- DMM offers expanded set of classifications for organizations of thought and behavior beyond infancy
- **Foundation**: differentiation between cognitive and affective forms of information processing underlying A and C strategies
- Inherently a two-category model with gradations between the two processes
- Types A and C are psychological opposites, with Types B and AC being their integration

**Crittenden's Model of Attachment and Information-Processing Strategies**

**Type A Strategies**:

- People using Type A strategies omit feelings from processing and act based on expected consequences (Crittenden, 2005, p. 4)
- Result of a disposition to process experience according to its perceived temporal contingencies (Crittenden, 2008, p. 19)
- Classifiable, organized strategies that involve using both cognitive and affective strategies in less integrated ways (A/C or AC) (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 230)
- Reflect learned patterns for protecting and adapting to dangerous circumstances (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 36)
- Can lead to distorted information and heightened expectation of danger under safe circumstances (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 35)
- Characteristic of insecure attachment

**Type C Strategies**:

- People using Type C strategies act based on feelings with little attention to consequences (Crittenden, 2005, p. 4)
- Result of a disposition to process experience according to its intensity and autonomic nervous system responses (Crittenden, 2008, p. 19)
- Classifiable, organized strategies that involve using both cognitive and affective strategies in less integrated ways (A/C or AC) (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 230)
- Reflect learned patterns for protecting and adapting to dangerous circumstances (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 36)
- Can lead to distorted information and heightened expectation of danger under safe circumstances (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 35)
- Characteristic of insecure attachment

**Type B Strategies**:

- Involve using a mix of both cognitive and affective information in a balanced, integrated way (Crittenden, 2008, pp. 19-20)
- Depending on the demands of the context

**Types A/C and AC**:

- Classifiable, organized strategies that involve using both cognitive and affective strategies, but in alternating (A/C) or blended (AC) ways (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 230)
- Incorporate false, denied, and delusional affect and cognition to varying degrees (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, pp. 230-231)

**Application Across Developmental Spectrum**:

- Crittenden's model can be applied across the developmental spectrum
- Specifies particular variants of affect-focused and cognition-focused strategies (Crittenden, 2008, pp. 16-88)

**Infancy**:

- Three possible variants of A (cognition-privileging) and C (affect-privileging) patterns

**Preschool Age**:

- Four new possible patterns reflecting maturing out of infancy patterns
- 13 possible attachment patterns in total

**School Age**:

- Six possible variants of C patterns but only four possible variants of A patterns
- Reflects findings that affect development outpaces cognitive development at this age range

**Adolescence and Adulthood**:

- 15 and 22 possible attachment patterns, respectively
- Greater cognitive and affective capacities lead to more complex strategies
- Any A and C strategy can operate in an alternating pattern as A/C

**Change with Development**:

- Maturation increases the range of mental and behavioral responses
- Self-protective organizations of thought and behavior may change with development, even when circumstances themselves are unchanging
- Can result in a change of pathways and the organization of new strategies (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 37)

### Identification of States of Mind

**Identification of States of Mind and Attachment Types**

Mary Main's work with the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) focuses on the coherence of an individual's state of mind when describing early attachment relationships. Coherence is defined as a connection or logical relationship between parts of discourse, truthful, succinct yet complete, relevant, and clear and orderly.

**Secure Adults**:
- Describe early attachment relationships in an organized, coherent manner.
- Richly and accurately describe memories with sufficient detail.
- Stay on topic.
- Depict a singular working model for each attachment figure.
- Score high (above 7) on the AAI coherence scale.

**Insecure Adults**:
- **Dismissing**:
  - Do not describe early attachment relationships in a very coherent manner.
  - Descriptions of early attachment figures are rarely supported by evidence.
  - May provide overidealized and unrealistic or insufficient memory detail.
  - Score low (below 3) on the AAI coherence scale.
- **Preoccupied**:
  - Are exceedingly verbose.
  - Descriptions of early attachment relationships are filled with irrelevancies, passive speech, and jargon.
  - Descriptions are often excessively long and meandering.
  - Score low (below 3) on the AAI coherence scale.
- **Disorganized**:
  - Present a contradictory mixture of dismissing and preoccupied speech.
  - Score low (below 3) on the AAI coherence scale.

The discovery that attachment patterns are represented by states of mind inferred through discourse patterns opened a new era in attachment research, allowing researchers to explore older children's and adults' representations of attachment. This shift enabled researchers to go beyond studying young children's nonverbal behavior as coded from the strange situation.

### Three Generations of Metacognition

**Metacognition**: Thinking about thinking or direct perception of one's own and others' state of mind, including cognitive and affective experiences. John Flavell (1986) defined metacognition as "thinking about thinking."

**Research on Metacognition in Attachment**:

- **Mary Main (1991)**: Discovered secure adults have a greater capacity to reflect on their attachment experiences and see the representational nature of beliefs and feelings.
- **Identified several kinds of metacognitive thinking**: 
  - appearance–reality distinction
  - representational diversity
  - representational change

**Metacognition in Attachment Research (AAI)**:

- Secure adults make more metacognitive statements in AAI transcripts.
- High scores on the metacognitive scale of the AAI are significantly correlated with coherence of transcript and coherence of mind.

**Mentalization**:

- Defined as making sense of actions based on intentional mental states (desires, feelings, beliefs).
- Reflective function refers to the psychological processes underlying mentalization.
- Developed the Reflective Functioning Scale (RF-S) by Peter Fonagy, Mary Target, and Howard and Miriam Steele.

**Reflective Functioning Scale (RF-S)**:

- **Measures reflective functioning across four domains**: awareness of mental states, behaviors' association with underlying states, developmental aspect of mental states, and mental states in relation to the interviewer.
- Scores range from minus 1 to plus 9; high scores indicate a highly developed reflective capacity.

**Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT)**:

- Developed by Fonagy and associates for patients with personality and dissociative disorders.
- Focuses on the development of mentalization capacity and reflective functioning.
- Outcome research shows significant improvement in reflective functioning, overall coherence of mind, and reduction or elimination of diagnostic criteria for personality disorders.

**Third Generation of Metacognition**:

- Antonio Semerari and associates at the Rome School take a modular view of metacognition.
- **Identified four discrete categories of metacognition**: metacognitive identification, mastery, relating, and integration or organization.
- Differences in metacognition between borderline and narcissistic personality disorders were found.
- **Implication**: Metacognitive deficits may be condition-specific, and metacognitive-based psychotherapy should address specific metacognitive deficits for each diagnostic condition.

### Intersubjectivity

**Intersubjectivity and Attachment**:

* Ainsworth's research on parental attunement laid the foundation for understanding secure and insecure attachment in infants through the Strange Situation procedure.
* Secure infants signal distress upon separation and relief upon reunion, while avoidant and ambivalent infants show different patterns of behavior.
* Researchers discovered that maternal responsiveness is not the only factor; the interaction between mother and baby as a secure or insecure dyad is significant.

**Maternal Presence as a Holding Environment**:

* Winnicott introduced the concept of a "good-enough" mother who consistently holds her child physically and emotionally, allowing the child to develop a sense of self.
* The mother's attuned presence acts as a holding environment for the child.
* Winnicott also emphasized the importance of play in child development.

**Infant-Mother Interactions**:

* Tronick et al. (1975) conducted the still face experiment, demonstrating the reciprocal nature of infant-caregiver attunement and the negative effects of misattunement.
* Andrew Meltzoff's theory of innate intersubjectivity is based on infants' ability to imitate adults' facial expressions, indicating a mental representation of others' behavior.
* Colwyn Trevarthen views intersubjectivity as arising from interactions between infant and mother over time, characterized by mutual imitation, emotional empathy, and reciprocal communication.

**Infant-Mother Interactions and Development**:

* Daniel Stern emphasizes dyadic affect attunement in infant-mother interactions and the shift towards mutually regulated subjective states between 9 and 12 months.
* Attachment and intersubjectivity are separate but complementary motivational systems, with attachment fostering felt security and intersubjectivity promoting psychic intimacy and belonging.
* Well-synchronized mother-infant interactions predict secure attachment (Karen, 1998).

### Attunement, Misattunement, and Synchronization of Expression

**Attunement, Misattunement, and Synchronization of Expression in Infant-Mother Interactions**

Beatrice Beebe's research on intersubjectivity focuses on synchronized and coordinated interactions between infants and mothers through nonverbal and verbal dyadic exchanges. This includes:

* Orientation, gaze, looking, head movements, gestures, postural mirroring, facial expression, and touch
* Tone and pitch, vocal rhythm, vocal timing, turn-taking

**Misattunement** **is the opposite of synchronized interactions. Beebe's research identified two types of misattunement in insecure infants**:

1. **Ambivalently attached infants**: Mothers misattuned to a broad spectrum of emotional expression but attuned when infant was afraid, training the baby to see fear as primary means of achieving relatedness.
2. **Avoidantly attached infants**: Mothers misattuned when infant expressed negative feelings or sought comfort, excelling in attuning to infant's exuberance.

**Beebe and Lachman's Research on Intersubjectivity with Adult Patient-Therapist Dyads**

* Utilized facial expression, self-touch, and other nonverbal communication to mirror patient's verbal rhythms, facial expressions, and body language
* Coordinated responses to model and enhance expressions of affect the patient would experience and convey if more securely attached
* Matching communicative expressions regulates interpersonal contact and inner state
* Gradual sense of "comforted" inner state as patient became more aware of therapist's coordination
* Use of motherese in attempting to evoke new capacities for attachment-oriented communication
* Making use of dyadic verbal communicative expressions is one of the pillars of attachment treatment

**Conclusion**

Beebe's research on intersubjectivity and misattunement has significantly contributed to understanding the importance of synchronized interactions between infants and mothers, as well as adult patient-therapist dyads. This knowledge sets the context for the rest of the book, which focuses on attachment disturbances in adults. The next chapter reviews developmental factors contributing to the emergence of the attachment bond in children.

## Chapter 2 Understanding the Development of Attachment Bonds and Attachment Behavior Over the Life Course

**Developmentally Informed Treatments for Attachment Disturbances**
- Based on understanding attachment bond formation
- Secure or insecure bonds shape internal representation (internal working model)
- Influence self-experience, affect regulation, and capacity for intimacy
- Treatment model presented in the book focuses on secure attachment development factors

**Developmental Phases in Infants' Attachment Bond Formation (Ainsworth)**
*Normative Factors and Dynamics*

1. **Initial Pre-Attachment (Birth to 2 months)**
   - Infant's biological readiness for social interaction
   - Caregiver's sensitivity and responsiveness
   - Mutual regulation of physiological states
2. **Attachment-in-the-Making (3-7 months)**
   - Infant's increased exploration and separation anxiety
   - Caregiver's consistent availability and responsiveness
   - Development of a sense of "safe haven" and "secure base"
3. **Clear-Cut Attachment (8-12 months)**
   - Infant's ability to recognize caregiver and distinguish from strangers
   - Caregiver's ability to provide comfort and security in response to distress
   - Development of a consistent attachment pattern
4. **Goal-Corrected Partnership (18-36 months)**
   - Infant's increasing understanding of the caregiver as a separate individual
   - Caregiver's ability to respond appropriately to child's needs and intentions
   - Development of a reciprocal relationship

\*Age ranges are approximate, development can vary greatly.

**Continued Maturation and Later Experience**
- Attachment bond changes during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood
- Affects self, affect regulation, and relational functioning

### Phase 1: The Pre-attachment Phase (Birth to 2–3 Months)

* Infants are entirely dependent on caregivers for survival and have evolved innate responses to attract attention and ensure care.
* Automatic, reflexive behaviors occur in the first weeks of life to establish recognition and connection with a caregiver.
* Human infants have a capacity for visual orientation and respond to humans with orienting responses.
* Primary pre-attachment behaviors include crying, babbling, reaching, grasping, clinging, smiling, and automatic facial displays.
* Crying is an alerting signal to the caregiver to come and soothe the infant.
* Facial displays function as cues to the caregiver regarding immediate physical needs and developmental needs.
* Caregiver's responses to infant's expressions shape the relationship and build attunement.
* Infant-caregiver interaction involves adapting to each other's rhythms to create a best-fit dyadic correspondence.
* Nonverbal imitation contributes to the emerging relationship between infant and caregiver, forming presymbolic communication.
* **Several nervous system maturations support the early attachment bond**:
  * Visual preference for human faces and increased looking at humans.
  * Head orientation toward others and preferential orientation toward primary caregiver.
  * Direct eye-to-eye contact and smiling response to that contact.

**Innate Responses to Humans (Birth - Few Weeks)**

* Infants have automatic, reflexive behaviors to attract caregivers' attention.
* Sensory systems are structured to respond to human behavior.
* Earliest signs of nonverbal communication include tongue protrusion, mouth opening, lip protrusion, smiling, and surprise.
* Infants can imitate nonverbal behavior as early as 42 minutes after birth.
* Innate response patterns promote and maintain human contact for survival.

**Pre-attachment Behaviors (First Weeks of Life)**

* **Crying**: automatic response to noxious conditions, alerting signal to caregiver.
* **Reaching, grasping, clinging**: physical expressions of desire for proximity and comfort.
* **Smiling**: earliest attachment behavior, reflexive response to interest or joy.
* **Automatic facial displays**: cues to caregiver regarding immediate needs and developmental needs.
  * Surprise, fear, frustration, anger, contentment.

**Facilitating Caregiver-Infant Interaction (First Weeks of Life)**

* Infant's expressions guide caregiver to modify the environment for optimal development.
* Caregiver's responses shape the relationship and build attunement.
* Repetition of display-response-display pattern allows caregiver to learn infant's needs.

**Nervous System Maturations Supporting Early Attachment Bond (Third to Fourth Weeks)**

* Visual preference for human faces and increased looking at humans.
* Head orientation toward others and preferential orientation toward primary caregiver.
* Direct eye-to-eye contact and smiling response to that contact.
* Infant's experience of being looked at by the caregiver increases caregiver's motivation for presence and attention.
* Preferred orientation toward primary caregiver and expectation of contingent responses are fundamental developmental achievements during this phase.

### Phase 2: Attachment-in-Making (2-3 to 6-9 Months)

During this phase, an infant's nervous system is not impaired and has received good-enough caregiving. The infant begins to differentiate between familiar caregivers and others, showing preferential orientation towards them. This phase is also referred to as "orientation and signals directed toward one (or more) discriminated figure(s)" (Ainsworth et al., 1978).

**Infant Behaviors**:

- Smiling in response to familiar caregivers
- Preferential orientation towards primary caregiver
- Reciprocal patterns of interaction with primary caregiver
- **Seven attachment behaviors emerge**:
  - Visual-motor orientation
  - Termination of crying
  - Smiling
  - Vocalization
  - Greeting (with vocalization and/or smiling and/or reaching)
  - Climbing and exploring
  - Crying when caregiver leaves

**Causes**:

- Significant sensorimotor advances from three to six months
- Differentiation and recognition of primary caretakers
- New possibilities for dynamic interaction

**Infant Development**:

- Increasing control over behaviors
- Deliberate responses during interactions
- Mutual exchange of facial displays between infant and caregiver
- Emergence of intersubjective communication
- Rudimentary "core self" and "emergent relatedness" develops
- Early sense of self emerges, not yet differentiated from caregivers

**Infant-Caregiver Interactions**:

- Continuous, reciprocally coordinated process between four-month-old infants and their caregivers (Beebe & Lachmann, 2014)
- Repetitive patterns of mutual nonverbal matching in secure dyads
- Repetitive patterns of mutual nonverbal mismatching in disorganized dyads
- Infant begins to seek and initiate interaction
- Greater control over behaviors during interactions

**Self-Developments**:

- Rudimentary "core self" and "emergent relatedness" develops between second and sixth month (Stern, 1985)
- Early sense of self emerges between fourth and eighth month (Lewis & Brooks, 1978)
- Infant's awareness of experience is promoted by sufficient caregiver attunement and mirroring (D. P. Brown, 1993)
- Self-developments are promoted by relational dynamics, which in turn contribute to further refinement and development of relational dynamics.

**Transition to Phase 3**:

- Infant comes to differentiate self from others (Mahler, Pine, & Bergman, 1975)
- Develops separate, distinct internal working models (IWMs) of caregivers and self (Marvin & Britner, 2008).

### Phase 3: Clear-Cut Attachment (6–9 Months to 36 Months)

* Beginning of unique bond between infant and primary caregiver (Ainsworth et al., 1978)
* Infants usually select one caregiver as the primary attachment figure (Marvin & Britner, 2008)
* Attachment behavior focused on particular person when available (Marvin & Britner, 2008)

**Consolidation of Attachment Bond and Development of Internal Working Models (IWMs)**

* Infants' continuing maturational developments and caregiver responses contribute to bond consolidation
* Attachment patterns become quite stable between 12-18 months (Hamilton, 2000; Waters et al., 2000; Sroufe et al., 2005)
* Secure attachment bond predicts later secure status in adulthood (Sroufe et al., 2005)

**Infant's Acquisition of Locomotion and New Attachment Behaviors**

* Infant able to maintain proximity with caregiver through locomotion (Ainsworth et al., 1978)
* **New attachment behaviors**: preference for approaching attachment figure, following, using as a secure base, flight to attachment figure (Marvin & Britner, 2008)
* **Other new behaviors**: burying face in attachment figure's lap and clinging when frightened or distressed

**Good Enough Infant-Caregiver System**

* Infant's manifestations of primary attachment bond contribute to strengthening of the bond (Sander, 1975)
* Capable caregiver responds with increased attentiveness and responsiveness (Marvin & Britner, 2008)
* Caregiver modifies behaviors based on infant's developmental advances
* Mutual responsivity and reciprocal affective display enhance infant's experience of availability and responsiveness of caregiver

**Infant's Development and Interaction with Caregiver**

* **Infant eliciting behavior**: taking initiative to elicit desired responses from caregiver (D. P. Brown, 1993)
* Mirroring feedback reinforces early affect experience
* Imitative capacity allows infant to express imitated affect expressions during a wider range of circumstances
* **Maturational events enhance infant's affect range and depth**: autonomic nervous system becomes more organized and stable (Izard et al., 1991; Lewis, 1971)

**Emergence of "Eighth Month Anxieties"**

- **Around eight months, infants show facial expressive and autonomic fear reactions in response to**:
  - Strangers
  - Separations from attachment figures
  - Novel or unfamiliar objects or surroundings
  - Looming visual stimuli (Marks, 1987; D. P. Brown, 1993)
- Infants become more wary of unfamiliar adults than objects (Marvin & Britner, 2008)
- Development of person and object permanence around eight months (Bell, 1970)
- Comparative evaluations of familiar and unfamiliar people, places, and objects are supported by internal images (D. P. Brown, 1993)

**Significant Integration and Differentiation Processes (9-12 months)**

- With object permanence, infants can search for hidden objects or anticipate whole objects from seeing parts of them (Piaget, 1981)
- Facilitated by attuned engagement and responsiveness from caregiver (D. P. Brown, 1993)

**Interpersonal Synchronization of Affective Expression and Experience**

- Caregiver's acknowledgement of child's affective display and internal visceral experience increases synchronization (D. P. Brown, 1993)
- **Important cognitive development**: ability to group and categorize emerges between 9 and 12 months (Inagaki, 1989)
- Continuing interpersonal mirroring promotes differentiation among affective states and linkage to external expressions (D. P. Brown, 1993)
- Subsequent affective experience becomes more differentiated and categorized into discrete emotional states (happy, sad, mad, scared) (D. P. Brown, 1993)
- Infant gets better at recognizing and categorizing affect states, leading to less automatic and stereotyped displays (D. P. Brown, 1993)
- Autonomous and directly related displays serve as better means of social communication (D. P. Brown, 1993)

**The Caregiver's Role in Phase 3 Developmental Achievements**

- By end of first year, infant in a good-enough system has capacity for wide range of affective experiences.
- Self-awareness refines and expands with categorical cognition forming "categorical self."
- Emergence of "subjective self" and discovery of other minds.
- Secure base behavior: infant leaves, returns to caregiver for comfort and reassurance.

**Factors Supporting Development**:

- Infant's maturational processes.
- Caregivers' ways of being with the infant.
- Interdependence of infant and caregiver behaviors.

**Caregiver Behavior and Attachment Bond**:

- Sensitive, responsive caregiving crucial for secure attachment bond.
- Maternal sensitivity: understanding child, accepting behavior, orchestrating harmonious interactions.

**General Factors Promoting Secure Attachment**:

- Physical presence.
- Consistency of beneficial caregiving factors and behaviors.
- Reliability of caregivers' availability and provision of care.
- Interest in infant and his/her individuality.

**Primary Behaviors Promoting Secure Attachment**:

1. **Protection**: physical safety.
2. **Attunement**: behavior, inner state, developmental capacities.
3. **Soothing and reassurance**: distress states.
4. **Expressed delight**: child's actions and unique being.
5. **Unconditional support**: exploration.

**Infant Experiences**:

- Felt sense of safety with caregiver.
- Comfort and security over time.

**Cognitive Developments**:

1. Capacity to categorize experience.
2. **Representational cognition**: symbolic representation of caregiver relationship internally.

**Formation of Internal Working Model**:

- Structuralization of relational experiences into foundation of attachment bond.
- Linking distinct affect states to particular caregivers.
- Development of internal map of attachment relationship.

### THE DEVELOPMENT OF REPRESENTATIONAL COGNITION

- Around 12-20 months, infants develop the capacity to link experiences to thought-based symbols (D. P. Brown, 1993)
  - **First sign**: looking at objects when named
  - Emergence of expressive language indicates rudimentary representational cognition
  - Shift from nonverbal gesturing and pointing to use of specific words as symbols

**Development of Internal, Symbolic Representations**

- During second year of life, image-based imitative action-memory sequences and schemas become material for formation of internal symbolic representations of self and others
  - **Rapprochement subphase (about 15 months)**: development of separate internal representations of self and others (Mahler et al., 1975)
  - By end of second year, child has distinct and stable self and other representations in dynamic relationship
- Understanding nature of internal working models (IWMs) or attachment maps is valuable for modifying or remapping them

**Content of Infant's Object Representation of Primary Attachment Relationship**

- **Central to representation**: infant's experiences with attachment figure
  - Caregiver's protectiveness, attunement, soothing, delight, and support
  - Infant's affective experience in response to caregiver's behaviors
- Affective states become embedded in dynamic web of internal representations (Brown, 1993)
  - Feelings about self and others linked to their internal images
  - Infant gains ability to represent affective quality of interactions
- Quality of interactions fundamental components of attachment map
  - **Secure attachment map**: safety, comfort, soothing, availability, reliability, stability
  - **Insecure attachment map**: unsafe, agitating, unreliable, unattuned, rejecting, confusing

**Function of Internal Representations**

- Develop an independent functional existence
- Infant can have experiences and feelings about self, attachment figure, and relationship in response to internal representations
- Set up expectations about interactions

### INTERNAL REPRESENTATIONS, AFFECT TOLERANCE, AND AFFECT SELF-REGULATION

- The ability to experience a range of emotions is a result of maturational and relational dynamics during the early Phase 3 period.
  - Stabilization of the autonomic nervous system.
  - Intensification of infant-caregiver relationship and reciprocal affective displays.
  - Emergence of categorical cognition.

**Capacity to Experience Emotions vs. Affect Tolerance and Self-Regulation**

- Capacity to experience a range of emotions is independent of the ability to tolerate and self-regulate them.
- Affect tolerance and self-regulation depend on the ability to evoke representations of soothing.

**Soothing Representations**

- Soothing experiences lead to internal representations of those experiences.
  - **Example**: "Hallucinatory breast" (Schur, 1955) – an infant's internal representation of being fed and comforted by the mother.
  - Transitional objects (Winnicott, 1953) – symbolic representations of soothing experiences that support affect tolerance and self-regulation.

**Importance of Caregiver's Role in Affect Tolerance and Self-Regulation**

- **In a good enough child-caregiver system**:
  - Child repeatedly experiences caregiver's soothing responses.
  - Maturation of representational capacity leads to internalization of the soothing function.
- Heinz Kohut and Marian Tolpin refer to this process as "transmuting internalization."
- The more reliable, consistent, and accurate the caregiver is in attuning to the infant's distress states and providing soothing, the stronger and more stable the infant's internal representations of that experience.

**Consequences of Failures in Good-Enough Attunement and Provision of Soothing**

- Consistent failures lead to impaired affect experience, tolerance, self-regulation, and self-organization.
- Insecure attachment and adult personality disorders are associated with problems in these domains.

### THE EMERGENCE OF PROTOTYPICAL ATTACHMENT PATTERNS
- The attachment bond develops gradually during the first year of life and its nature (secure or insecure) can be malleable until the infant's capacity for internal, symbolic representation around 12 months.
- The period up to 12 months is a sensitive period for attachment formation.
- Attachment bonds formed after the first year are more complicated and less adaptive than those formed during the first year.
- Around 12 months, infant's experiences with caregivers create internal representations, which structuralize into relatively stable attachment prototypes.
- Modification of these attachment prototypes requires changing existing representations rather than simple coalescing.

**Attachment Prototypes and Internal Working Models**
- Attachment prototypes are main forms of internal working models or attachment maps created by infant's experiences with caregivers, particularly the primary attachment figure.
- **Ainsworth et al.'s (1978) three prototypes**: avoidant (A), secure (B), and ambivalent/resistant (C).
- Mary Main and Judith Solomon added disorganized/disoriented (D) attachment.
- These patterns are observable, consistent starting at around one year old.
- Ainsworth et al.'s study found that these attachment classifications were very stable from 12 to 18 months.
- In the Minnesota Longitudinal Study, 62% of children received the same attachment classification at 12 and 18 months.
- Some children changed attachment classifications between 12 and 18 months due to maternal affective behavior.

**Factors Influencing Attachment Development**

- Mothers' affective engagement with infants is crucial for secure attachment development.
- Mothers who were less engaged with their newborns but had many other children often showed declining security in their relationship with the new infant over the first year.
- Mothers who initially responded negatively to pregnancy but became more positive and skilled at caregiving over the first year led to infants developing secure attachment.
- Bowlby suggested that an optimal emotional environment for infants includes a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with their caregiver in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment.

### Attachment Behavior During the Toddler Period (18 to 36 Months)

**Internal Working Model and Attachment Organization**

* Establishment of an underlying internal working model marks a milestone in attachment development during the second year
* No significant internal structural changes occur from age 1 to about 3 years
* Secure infants are less distressed by separation episodes and require less physical contact during reunion episodes by 18 months (Karen, 1998)

**Behavioral Changes in Attachment**

* Increase in exploratory behavior due to motor and cognitive development
* Greater skill in monitoring caregiver's location, behavior, and attentiveness during exploration
* Two-year-olds cry less during reunion episodes but engage in more verbal calling and active search (Marvin & Britner, 2008)
* Physical proximity-seeking decreases and is partially replaced by verbal expressions

**Major Developmental Issues During the Toddler Years**

* **Guided self-regulation**: increasing self-regulation but continued dependence on caregiver for cues, feedback, and support (Sroufe et al., 2005)
* Verbal communication becomes increasingly complex
* Secure child develops elaborate affective concepts and fantasies and learns to verbalize affective states (D. P. Brown, 1993)
* **Cooperative behavior increases**: secure 18-month-olds show altruistic behavior (Tomasello, 2009)

**Three-Year-Olds in the Strange Situation**

* Less disturbed by first separation episode and maintain exploratory behavior at a high level
* Much less distressed than younger children by brief separations
* Required less physical contact and physical proximity during reunion episodes (Ainsworth et al., 1978)
* Developed locomotor skills allow for greater responsibility in gaining and maintaining proximity to attachment figure under most conditions (Marvin & Britner, 2008)

### Attachment Behavior During the Preschool Years (3 to 5 Years of Age)

- **Major developmental issues**: increasing self-regulation independent of caregiver, greater self-agency with support, self-direction and self-management, and increasing peer competence (Sroufe et al., 2005)

**Attachment Patterns and Peer Relationships**

- Secure (B) and ambivalent (C) three-and-a-half-year-olds have more positive peer relationships (Cassidy, Kirsh, Scolton, & Parke, 1996)
- Four-year-olds less disturbed by separation and maintain high exploratory behavior in Strange Situation compared to younger children (Ainsworth et al., 1978; Ainsworth, 1990)

**Preschool Attachment Patterns**

- **Crittenden (2008)**: preschoolers begin to show capacity for coy behavior and false-positive affect (not intentional deception)
- **Six attachment patterns identified based on Strange Situation behavior**: secure/balanced, defended, coercive, defended/coercive, anxious-depressed, and insecure/other (Crittenden, 1992a, 1992b)
- **Five preschool attachment patterns identified from SS observations**: secure, avoidant, ambivalent, controlling/disorganized, and insecure/other (Cassidy & Marvin, 1992)

**Preschool Profiles of Attachment Types**

- **Sroufe et al. (2005)**: four attachment prototypes from one-year-olds associated with specific preschool profiles
  - Avoidant (A) children become hostile/mean, emotionally insulated, asocial, and disconnected during preschool years
  - Ambivalent/resistant (C) children show anxious, overstimulated, and passive-dependent patterns by three and a half years
  - Disorganized (D) children, who previously failed to show any definable attachment prototype, show signs of organization in the form of controlling behaviors

**Problematic Preschool Behaviors in Disorganized Children**

- More defensive aggression toward peers and disruptive behaviors at preschool than secure and other insecure attachment types (Solomon & George, 1999)
- Anxiety about school performance and lower self-esteem than other same-age children in preschool (Lyons-Ruth, Alpern, & Repacholi, 1993)

### Phase 4: Goal-Corrected Partnership

According to Marvin and Britner (2008), during the third year of life, children begin to understand that others have their own feelings, goals, and plans. This shift in understanding leads to significant changes in the attachment system between the ages of 3 and 5 years.

**Significant Findings**:

- Three-year-olds may accept or protest separation but do not engage in setting up a shared plan for departure and reunion.
- Four-year-olds engage in negotiation with their mother to establish a shared plan, reducing distress during separations.

**Causes of Shift**:

- Children's information-processing capacities develop between three and a half and five years of age.
- They can now comprehend multiple components of higher-order conceptualizations, including relationships.

**Characteristics of Four-Year-Olds**:

- Interactions with attachment figures based on physical orientation, eye contact, nonverbal expressions, affect, and personal conversations.
- Secure child's internal working model represents the attachment figure as available independent of proximity.
- Child can call upon the representation for reassurance and trust that the actual attachment figure will be available in conditions of upset and need.

**Impact on Self-Development**:

- Growing comfort with exploring the physical and interpersonal world.
- Promotes interactions with nonfamiliar peers and adults.

### Attachment Patterns in School Age Children (5 to 7 Years of Age)
**Studies on Attachment Patterns in Six-Year-Olds**

- Several studies have investigated the similarities and differences between attachment patterns in the Strange Situation at one year and six years of age.
- Main and Cassidy (1988) modified the Strange Situation to develop a reunion paradigm for six-year-olds.
  * One-hour separation period with photo review.
  * Sandbox free-play before caregiver returns.

**Main and Cassidy Study (1988)**

- Did not include ambivalent children in the original sample.
- Secure, Avoidant, and Disorganized/Controlling groups showed an 84% concordance rate in attachment prototype classification over five years.
- Six-year-olds primarily used language to express attachment needs at reunion episodes.
  * Secure six-year-olds initiated conversations about separation and reunion.
  * Avoidant six-year-olds looked briefly at caregivers, spoke minimally, and continued playing with toys.
  * Disorganized/Controlling six-year-olds assumed a parental role and attempted to control or direct the parent's attention and behavior.
    * **Subtypes of Controlling Behaviors**
      * Punitive disorganized children embarrassed and humiliated caregivers upon reunion.
      * Caretaking disorganized children were overly acquiescent and directed parental behavior during reunion.
- Noted a link between disorganization and later controlling behaviors.

**Wartner et al. Study (1994)**

- Used Main and Cassidy's reunion protocol for six-year-olds and included children with A, B, C, or D classifications from SS observations at 12 or 18 months.
- Found a comparable 82% concordance rate in attachment prototype classification over five years.
- Secure six-year-olds showed less physical proximity-seeking but greater verbal expression during reunion episodes.
- Avoidant six-year-olds turned away from caregivers and showed little interaction or communication at reunion.
- Only one child was classified as ambivalent at age six.
- Disorganized attachment concordance rate was 75%.
- Secure children at both study periods had fewer behavioral problems and were more competent in preschool.
- Majority of secure children were found in the competent group, disorganized children were equally distributed between competent and incompetent groups, and avoidant children were overrepresented in the incompetent groups.
- Disorganized six-year-olds showed more odd and aggressive behaviors.

**Solomon and George (1999)**

- Disorganized children at this age engage in power struggles and manifest high levels of behavior problems.

**Teti et al. (1995)**

- Disorganized attachment in early years becomes behavioral disorganization in later childhood.

### Attachment During Middle Childhood (7 to 12 Years of Age)
- Children experience more separations from parents due to school and activities
- Preference for peers as playmates over parents (Kerns, 2008)
- **Adaptation to separations**:
  - Less reliant on physical proximity of parental figures
  - More reliant on their general availability during distress
  - Children take on function of self-protection
- Preference for parents over peers in situations invoking attachment needs (Kerns, 2008)

**Attachment and Development in Middle Childhood**

- **Secure middle childhood children**:
  - Higher school and peer competence than insecure children (Sroufe et al., 2005)
- **Insecure attachment in middle childhood**:
  - **Avoidant children**: less contact-seeking
  - **Anxious-resistant children**: seek excessive guidance, reassurance, and nurturance from adults

**Impact of Early Childhood Attachment on Middle Childhood Peer Perception**

- **Cassidy et al. (1996)**: peer perception affected by parental attachment figure representation
- Avoidant children in middle childhood more likely to perceive peers as having hostile intent if they perceived parents as rejecting in early childhood
- Representation of parent generalizes to representation of peers (Cassidy et al., 1996)

**Internal Working Model of Attachment Relationships in Middle Childhood**

- **Kerns (2008)**: question if children develop integrated internal working model at this age
- Consistent experiences with different attachment figures may lead to general, internally consistent representation of attachment relationships
- Development may not occur until adolescence for children with very different experiences with different attachment figures.

### Attachment Patterns During Adolescence

- Majority of adolescents retain their prototypical attachment styles from earlier childhood (Allen & Land, 1999)
- **Adolescent attachment behavior is characterized by**:
  - Single overarching attachment organization
  - Comparison of relationships with different attachment figures and hypothetical ideals
  - Increased sophistication in managing goal-corrected partnerships with parents
  - Gradual increase in independence, but still seeking parental support in extreme stress
- **Goal-corrected partnership between adolescent and parents**:
  - Characterized less by coordination and more by negotiation (Allen, 2008)
  - Developing new balance between attachment behaviors and exploratory needs
- Adolescence marked by transfer of dependencies from parental to peer relationships
- Peer relationships take on primary role in supporting autonomy and exploratory behavior
- **Initial attempts at romantic intimate attachments have similar characteristics as early child–caregiver attachment relationships**:
  - Proximity-seeking
  - Secure base
  - Safe haven
  - Separation protest
- By late adolescence, certain long-term peer and intimate relationships serve the same functions as early childhood attachment relationships for securely attached individuals (Allen & Land, 1999)
- Parental attachment figures continue to provide emotional security during adolescent identity formation and autonomy development

**Insecure Attachment in Adolescence**

- **Allen & Hauser (1996)**: Dismissing adolescents showed least autonomy and relatedness with parents
  - Disengagement from parental attachment figures may interfere with normal development
  - Associated with externalizing symptoms
- **Becker-Stoll & Fremmer-Bombik (1997)**: Dismissing attachment in adolescence linked to externalizing symptoms
- **Kobak & Sceery (1988): Dismissing adolescents**:
  - Lower on ego-resilience
  - More distant and alone
  - Express greater hostility
  - Lower levels of family support
- **Anxious-preoccupied adolescents**:
  - Greater autonomy-inhibiting behaviors
  - Enmeshed with parents throughout adolescence
  - Predicted anxious-preoccupied attachment at age 25 based on enmeshment at age 14 (Allen & Hauser, 1996)
- **Preoccupied adolescents**:
  - Persistence of involving anger from conflicts with fathers 10 years earlier
  - Overly personalize arguments and unable to withdraw from conflicts
  - Involving anger associated with internalizing coping style and depression (Allen & Hauser, 1996)
- **Preoccupied adolescents**:
  - Less ego-resilient
  - More anxious
  - Higher levels of distress
  - Needed more family support than other adolescents (Kobak & Sceery, 1988)
- **Secure adolescents**:
  - More ego-resilient
  - Less anxious
  - Less hostile with peers than insecure adolescents.

### Attachment in Adult Intimate Relationships

- **According to Hazen and Zeifman (1999), certain adult romantic relationships exhibit attachment behaviors and functions, including**:
  - **Proximity-seeking**: goal of closeness for physical comfort and soothing, as well as goals based on sexual attraction.
  - **Providing a secure base**: mutual experience of security and support.
  - **Providing a safe haven**: offering emotional refuge during times of distress.
  - **Manifesting separation distress**: feelings of anxiety or sadness when separated from the partner.

**Differences between Childhood and Adult Attachment**

- Childhood attachments are one-sided, while adult romantic attachment is mutual.
- Goal-corrected partnership in adult relationships involves mutual attachment regulation.

**Stages of Romantic Relationship Development into a Deep Attachment Bond**

1. **Pre-attachment**: initial stage before the relationship begins.
2. **Attachment-in-the-making (falling in love)**: developing feelings of attraction and closeness.
3. **Clear-cut attachment (loving)**: strong emotional bond between partners.
4. **Mutual goal-corrected partnership**: mutual regulation of attachment needs.
5. **Emotional interdependence**: deep emotional connection and commitment.

**Complexity of Adult Romantic Internal Working Models (IWMs)**

- IWMs include elements of early attachment prototypes and core conflictual relationship themes.
- Secure adults are more able to update and modify internal relational maps than insecure adults.

**Adult Romantic IWMs vs. Childhood Attachment Prototypes**

- Adult romantic IWMs are more diverse and flexible than childhood attachment prototypes for secure adults.
- Insecure adults show less diversity and flexibility and may manifest a prototype of insecure attachment across multiple relationships.

**Hierarchy of Adult Relational Models**

- **According to Collins and Read (1994), adult relational models are complex and hierarchically arranged**:
  - Set of generalized models at the top of the hierarchy, applying to a wide range of others but less predictive for any specific situation.
  - Models for particular classes of relationships (e.g., family members, peers) at an intermediate level.
  - Models for particular relationships (e.g., father, spouse) at the lowest level.

## PART II ASSESSMENT 
## CHAPTER 3 Adult Attachment Prototypes and Their Clinical Manifestations

**Adult Attachment Prototypes**

This chapter discusses the main features of each adult attachment prototype, focusing on secure attachment and the insecure types. The text introduces the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) in Chapter 4, but outlines here the typical responses for each attachment type to provide a comprehensive understanding.

**Securely Attached Adults**

* Secure attachment develops from consistent maternal responsiveness and contingent matching.
* Report positive and stronger bonds with parents.
* Interactions with family-of-origin members are generally positive.
* May or may not have had less childhood adversity than insecure individuals.
* Balance attachment and autonomous exploration.
* Value attachment relationships, regard attachment experiences as influential but independent and objective.
* Comfortable acknowledging a need to depend on others.
* Secure adults' AAI discourse indicates clear valuing of attachment, ease with the topic, coherent discourse, metacognitive monitoring, and fresh speech.
* Secure adults are comfortable with their own limitations and imperfections.
* Seek emotional support from partners when distressed and provide support to a distressed partner.
* Relationships tend to be more stable and satisfying than insecure adults'.
* Coherence, intimacy, balance of control in friendships, level of involvement in romantic relationships, self-confidence, and warmth are highly correlated with secure attachment.
* Secure adults have greater access to both positive and negative memories.
* More ego-resilient and less anxious than insecure individuals.
* Describe themselves mostly positively but can acknowledge negative self attributes.
* Have a coherent, positive sense of self.
* In therapy, secure patients are more likely to experience the therapist as a secure base and report positive working alliances.
* Explore therapeutic issues in greater depth than insecure patients.

**Table 3.1: Manifestations of Adult Attachment Security**

| Characteristic | Description |
|---|---|
| Positive bond with parents | Secure attachment develops from consistent maternal responsiveness and contingent matching. |
| Balanced exploration | Secure children find a healthy balance between attachment and autonomous exploration. |
| Valuing attachment | Secure adults value attachment relationships and regard attachment-related experiences as influential. |

| Comfort with dependence | Secure adults can acknowledge a need to depend on others at times. |
| Coherent discourse | Secure adults' AAI discourse is clear, coherent, and easy to follow. |
| Metacognitive monitoring | Secure adults are able to reflect on their thoughts and feelings during the interview. |
| Forgiveness and compassion | Secure adults can talk about failures of their own parents with a sense of proportion and context, sometimes with forgiveness and compassion. |
| Emotional support seeking | Secure adults seek emotional support from their partners when distressed. |
| Emotional support providing | Secure adults provide emotional support to a distressed partner. |
| Stable and satisfying relationships | Secure adult relationships tend to be more stable and satisfying than insecure adults'. |
| Coherence, intimacy, balance of control, self-confidence, and warmth | Secure adults obtain high ratings on these qualities. |
| Access to memories | Secure adults have greater access to both positive and negative memories. |
| Ego-resilience | Secure adults are more ego-resilient and less anxious than insecure individuals. |
| Positive self-description | Secure adults describe themselves mostly positively but can acknowledge negative self attributes. |
| Coherent, positive sense of self | Secure adults have a coherent, positive sense of self. |
| Therapeutic alliance | Secure patients are more likely to experience the therapist as a secure base and report positive working alliances. |
| Greater depth in therapy | Secure patients explore therapeutic issues in greater depth than insecure patients. |
| Higher self-disclosure in therapy | Secure patients have higher self-disclosure in therapy than insecure patients. |

### Dismissing Insecure Adults

- **Avoidant Attachment**: a type of attachment style developed due to consistent and repetitive rejection of attachment behaviors by the primary attachment figure.
- **Dismissing Attachment**: a specific manifestation of avoidant attachment, characterized by deactivation of the attachment system and reliance on non-attachment related systems for coping and adaptation.

**Causes of Dismissing Attachment**:

* Consistent rejection or neglect of attachment behaviors by primary attachment figure
* Child learns to suppress attachment behavior to receive minimal care
* Parents of infants with dismissing attachment tend to terminate their infants' cries less often and hold them less during the first months of life, leaving the infant in a painful state for considerable periods of time.

**Manifestations of Dismissing Attachment**:

* Aloofness and contempt
* Mistrust about depending on others
* Difficulty getting close
* Preference for remaining distant
* Fear of closeness
* Lack of emotion or minimization of emotional expression
* Discomfort with opening up, especially about private thoughts
* Illusion of self-sufficiency
* Alexithymia (difficulty identifying and expressing emotions)

**Characteristics of Dismissing Attachment in Adult Discourse**:

* High degree of unrealistic idealization of one or both parents
* Emphasizing parental activities over the quality of the early relationship
* Giving a positive endorsement to negative parental behaviors
* Minimizing negative experiences
* Dismissive or derogatory attitude towards attachment
* Inability to access attachment-related memories
* Remote from emotions when answering questions that typically evoke attachment-related emotions
* Rare mention of hurt, distress, or vulnerability
* Emphasis on the self as strong, independent, or normal.

**Effects of Dismissing Attachment**:

* Unlikely to seek social support
* Highly likely to engage in distancing coping behaviors
* State of mind indicates an attempt to limit the influence of attachment relationships in thought, feeling, or daily life.

**Adult Dismissing Attachment**

* Dismissing adults engage primarily in deactivating attachment strategies (Mikulincer et al., 2009)
* Tend to deny vulnerability, emphasize personal strengths, avoid threats, and resist becoming dependent on anyone (Mikulincer et al., 2009)
* Fear of intimacy, emotional highs and lows, and jealousy (Hazen & Shaver, 1987)
* Uncomfortable with closeness and intimacy, not confident in others’ availability, and not particularly worried about being abandoned (Collins & Read, 1990)
* Low on measures of emotional expressiveness and warmth and low on all measures reflecting closeness in personal relationships (Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991)
* Report fewer emotional memories than secure adults (Mikulincer & Orbach, 1995)
* Have poor immediate recall of information regarding attachment-related experiences (Mukulincer & Shaver, 2007)
* Encoded less information about the interview than non-avoidant adults (Fraley et al., 2000)
* Turn their attention away from troubling attachment-related thoughts and emotions, requiring active cognitive effort (Mikulincer et al., 2004)
* Suppress autonomic response associated with emotional arousal (Fraley & Shaver, 1997)
* Few words to describe attachment-related experiences and are often alexithymic (Mallinckrodt & Wei, 2005)
* Lower in self-disclosure than secure individuals (Lopez, 2009)
* Characterized by hostility and coldness in relationships (Horowitz et al., 1993)
* Seen as cold, aloof, and dominating (Batholomew & Horowitz, 1991)
* Denial of attachment needs, avoidance of closeness, intimacy, and dependence, maximization of cognitive, emotional, and physical distance from others, strivings for self-reliance and independence (Mikulincer et al., 2003)
* Low levels of intimacy and emotional involvement in close relationships, suppression of painful thoughts, repression of negative memories, lack of cognitive accessibility to negative self-representations, projection of negative self-traits onto others, failure to acknowledge negative emotions, denial of basic fears (Mikulincer et al., 2003)
* Retain a wish for closeness but more concerned with bolstering a strong autonomous self (Waldinger et al., 2003)
* Have a differentiated but less well-integrated self-structure, lacking balance, integration, and inner coherence (Mikulincer, 1995)
* Tend to inflate their self-esteem defensively in the face of attachment threats and project unwanted self traits onto others (Mallinckrodt et al., 2009; Mikulincer & Horesh, 1999)
* Have a more negative self-image than secure adults (Mikulincer, 1995)
* Underrepresented in clinical samples and unlikely to seek therapy voluntarily (Lopez, 2009)
* Less self-disclosing than secure or anxious patients in therapy (Mikulincer & Nachshon, 1991)
* Explore others’ rather than their own problems and use therapy to convince themselves that they are OK (Lopez, 2009; Mikulincer & Nachshon, 1991)
* Intellectualized rather than emotional disclosures and rarely explore their own issues and dynamics (Mikulincer & Nachshon, 1991)
* Less responsive to therapist disclosures (Mikulincer & Nachshon, 1991)
* Denial of attachment needs, compulsive self-reliance, dismissal of threats and need for attachment figure availability (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007)
* **Two main goals in relationships**: gaining whatever they need while maintaining distance, control, and self-reliance, and ignoring or denying needs and avoiding negative emotional states that might trigger attachment-system activation (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007)

**Possible Manifestations of Adult Dismissing Insecure Attachment**

* Minimizing the importance of relationships
* Avoiding emotional expression or intimacy
* Focusing on self-reliance and independence
* Difficulty recognizing or acknowledging attachment needs
* Projecting negative emotions or traits onto others
* Intellectualizing problems rather than addressing emotions
* Defensively inflating self-esteem in the face of attachment threats
* Difficulty forming close relationships
* Minimizing the impact of past relationship experiences on current relationships
* Focusing on maintaining control and distance in relationships
* Difficulty trusting others or feeling comfortable with emotional vulnerability.

### Anxious-Preoccupied Insecure Adults

Anxious-preoccupied attachment is the outcome of a prolonged pattern of inconsistent responsiveness from the attachment figure and overinvolvement in the caregiver's state of mind. This experience leads to hyperactivation of the infant's attachment system, resulting in:

- Diminished exploratory behavior and hyperactivation of attachment behavior (e.g., clinginess)
- Predominantly using hyperactivating strategies in relationships

**Hyperactivating Strategies**

Anxious-preoccupied adults employ various hyperactivating strategies to maintain closeness and establish intimacy:

1. Strong approach orientation toward relationship partners
2. Clinging and controlling responses
3. Cognitive and behavioral efforts aimed at minimizing distance from the partner
4. Efforts at perceived self–other similarity, intimacy, and "oneness"

**State of Mind on the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)**

Anxious-preoccupied adults display specific discourse characteristics on the AAI:

1. Passive, vague discourse that fails to convey clear meaning
2. Canned speech
3. Preoccupation with past anger and resentments
4. Excessive use of psychological jargon
5. Discourse that frequently wanders off topic and contains numerous irrelevancies
6. Excessive uncertainties and oscillations in point of view
7. Excessive self-or other-blame
8. Weak or undeveloped sense of self
9. Frequent shifts in orientation for past/present, parent/self, or self/child
10. Preoccupation with rejection and abandonment themes
11. Limited capacity for self-soothing
12. Excessive need for reassurance

**Characteristics of Anxious-Preoccupied Adults in Relationships**

Anxious-preoccupied adults engage primarily in hyperactivating attachment strategies, as evidenced by:

1. High self-disclosure and emotional expressiveness
2. Frequent crying
3. Relying on others for support
4. Use of others as a secure base
5. Caregiving tendencies
6. Tendency to cry frequently in the presence of others
7. Low balance of control in friendships
8. High level of romantic involvement
9. Obsession, desire for reciprocation and union, emotional highs and lows, and extreme sexual attraction and jealousy
10. Overdependence on relationship partners
11. Detection of threats in nearly every transaction
12. Intensification of negative emotional responses to threatening events
13. Heightened mental rumination on threat-related concerns
14. Anxious, hypervigilant attention to relationship partners
15. Rapid detection of possible signs of disapproval, waning interest, or impending abandonment
16. High attachment anxiety
17. Worried about being abandoned and unloved
18. Over-evaluation of threat in close relationships
19. Unable to suppress painful emotions centering around fear of abandonment or rejection
20. Vigilant about possible neglect, rejection, or abandonment
21. Hypersensitive to signs of danger and lack of care
22. Seek excessive reassurance in close relationships
23. More likely to infer rejection and hostile intentions from others than secure adults
24. Appraise themselves more negatively in the face of threat
25. More likely to perceive conflict and anticipate conflict escalation
26. Report significantly greater distress than secure adults in the context of intimate relationships
27. Tendency to exaggerate their distress and intensify negative emotions in close relationships
28. Negative beliefs about their ability to cope with distress and expect that others will be inconsistently responsive and available
29. Seek, but devalue, social feedback
30. Disclose indiscriminately to those who are not prepared for intimate interactions
31. Unresponsive to their partner's disclosures

**Anxious-Preoccupied Adults**

* Characterized by preoccupation with past hurts and attachment-related memories and emotions
* Pervasively negative moods and strong emotional reactivity (Wei et al., 2005)
* Increased vulnerability to depressive symptoms due to increased need for reassurances from others (Wei et al., 2005)
* Maladaptive perfectionism and ineffective coping mediate depression (Wei et al., 2006)

**Self-Concept and Self-Structure**

* Ruminating on past hurts and negative experiences.

### Disorganized/Fearful Insecure Adults

**Disorganized/Fearful Attachment** **in both children and adults**:

* Outcome of frightening and frightened parental behavior, unresolved trauma or loss in a parent (Main & Hesse, 1990, 1992)
* Parent is present but not present to the child, leading to repetitive unresponsiveness
* More likely to report one or more parents with drinking problems or physical/sexual abuse
* Manifest contradictory deactivating and hyperactivating attachment styles in different circumstances or simultaneously
* Strong propensity to dissociate in the face of attachment-related threats
* Low coherence of discourse/mind, indicating multiple, contradictory attachment patterns with no dominant style
* Combinations of dismissing and preoccupied patterns common, leading to "cannot classify" (CC) classification
* Unresolved/disorganized (Ud) status with respect to loss or trauma also common

**Characteristics of Disorganized/Fearful Adults**:

* Low self-confidence
* Negative correlations with self-confidence, coherence, and closeness of relationships
* Passive, unassertive, socially inhibited in relationships (Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991)
* Fears of rejection and withdrawal negatively correlated with session exploration (Mallinckrodt et al., 2005)
* Intense distrust of others, behavioral avoidance of relationships, and a view of self as unlovable and unworthy of care (Reis & Grenyer, 2004)

* Failure to achieve safety and security following proximity seeking
* Defensive deactivation of attachment system or intense activation until security is attained
* Inhibited exploratory behavior except when sufficiently dissociated
* Mixed attachment strategy resembling the "disorganized" attachment pattern observed in Ainsworth's Strange Situation
* Trouble maintaining relationships due to fear and avoidance
* Difficulty regulating emotions and expressing them appropriately
* Chronic low self-esteem
* History of attachment-related traumas, such as physical or sexual abuse
* Persistent themes of interpersonal distrust, vulnerability, and passive withdrawal

## Chapter 4 The Assessment of Adult Attachment

**Mary Ainsworth's Legacy**

- Pioneered structured assessment of childhood attachment with the Strange Situation procedure (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978)
- Developed understanding of attachment bonds and their manifestations
- Several validated measures available for assessing attachment in children (Solomon & George, 2008)

**Focus on Adult Attachment**

- Understanding and treatment of insecure attachment patterns in adults
- Accurate identification essential for effective treatment

**Assessment Methods**

Two main types: interview-based and self-report-based

**Interview-Based Assessment**

*More comprehensive detail about attachment patterns and dynamics*

**Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)**

- Developed to understand parent's state of mind regarding attachment
- Elicits language patterns indicative of attachment states of mind
- Highly related to infant Strange Situation attachment behavior
- **Five primary AAI classifications**:
  * Secure or autonomous
  * Dismissing (parallel to avoidant)
  * Preoccupied (parallel to resistant/ambivalent)
  * Unresolved/disorganized
  * Cannot Classify (no correspondent infant Strange Situation category)
- Represents deeply internalized strategies for regulating emotion and attention
- Activates internal working model, creating language patterns for identification

**Comparison of AAI and Strange Situation Classifications**

| AAI Classification | Characteristic Adult Verbal Behavior | Infant Strange Situation Behavior |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Secure              | Coherent, narrative consistency   | Explores environment, seeks comfort from caregiver |
| Dismissing          | Minimal reflection on past       | Avoids interaction with caregiver |
| Preoccupied         | Over-involvement in past        | Resistant or ambivalent behavior  |
| Unresolved/Disorganized | Inconsistent, disorganized      | Disoriented or disorganized behavior |
| Cannot Classify     | N/A                             | N/A                              |

**Significance of AAI Classifications**

- Reflects conscious and unconscious rules for attachment organization
- Represents "rules to live by" (Wallin, 2007)
- Foundation of operative internal working model of attachment
- Activates internal working model, creating language patterns for identification

**Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)**

- Assesses adult attachment status through language by examining how attachment experiences are described during a semi-structured interview
- **Central task for participants**: producing and reflecting on memories related to attachment while maintaining coherent, collaborative discourse with the interviewer
- Historical accuracy of described attachment experiences not important
- Assesses in-the-present state of mind with respect to attachment, revealing operative internal working model

**Attachment Categories**

*Secure (B)*
  - Coherent, collaborative discourse
  - Values attachment but explores room and toys during pre-separation episodes
  - Displays signs of missing parent during separation and evaluation is consistent
  - Preference for parent over stranger
  - Greets parent actively and initiates physical contact
  - Settles and returns to play after reunion

*Secure/autonomous (F)*
  - Coherent, collaborative discourse
  - Explores room and toys during pre-separation episodes with objective perspective
  - Displays signs of missing parent during separation but may not cry
  - Values attachment but focuses on toys or environment during procedure
  - Settles and takes comfort in parent on reunion

*Dismissing (D)*
  - Not coherent
  - Dismisses attachment-related experiences
  - Fails to cry on separation from parent
  - Actively avoids and ignores relationship
  - Normalizing response to parent on reunion
  - Little or no proximity-seeking or contact-seeking
  - Unemotional response to parent
  - Transcripts tend to be excessively brief, violating Grice's maxims of quantity and relevance

*Avoidant (A)*
  - Similar to Dismissing but with more anger and passive responses

*Preoccupied (E)*
  - Not coherent
  - Preoccupied by past attachment relationships
  - Wary or distressed prior to separation
  - Long, grammatically entangled sentences
  - Fails to settle and take comfort in parent on reunion
  - Focuses on parent throughout procedure
  - Transcripts are excessively long, violating Grice's maxim of quantity

*Disorganized/disoriented (Ud)*
  - Displays disorganized and/or disoriented behaviors during discussions of loss or abuse
  - Lapses in monitoring reasoning or discourse
  - May indicate belief that a dead person is still alive or that this person was killed by someone
  - Infant may freeze, rise, huddle, or cling while crying
  - Ordinarily fits the D, E, or F category

**Assessment Process**

- AAI gives reliable and valid assessment of adult attachment status through language
- Interviewee's statements and evaluation of those statements reveal operative internal working model that applies to all attachment-related experiences.

**Administration of the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)**

- Obtains information through a semi-structured interview with 20 primary questions and follow-ups
- Takes between 45 to 75 minutes, audio-recorded for later transcription
- Requires supervised training by a qualified trainer before administration

**Overview of AAI Question Categories and Questions**

1. **Family Background**: Open question about the speaker's family background
2. **Early Childhood Relationships**: Description of relationships with each parent, five adjectives to describe each relationship, and identification of the closer parent
3. **Handling Emotional Upset, Illness, and Physical Injury**: Exploration of how parents handled these situations from the speaker's perspective
4. **Significant Separations**: Reflection on experiences and parents' responses to separations
5. **Emotionally Charged Experiences**: Discussion of rejection, threats, abuse, loss, and other emotionally charged experiences
6. **Influence of Early Childhood Experiences**: Consideration of how childhood experiences influenced adult personality
7. **Relationships with Other Adults**: Reflection on relationships with adults besides parents
8. **Childhood Losses**: Discussion of losses of parents or other important people
9. **Parental Behavior Change**: Comparison of parental behavior from childhood to adulthood
10. **Current Relationships with Parents**: Reflection on current relationships with surviving parents
11. **Learning from Childhood Experiences**: Contemplation of what was learned from childhood experiences
12. **Attachment Relationship with Own Children**: Discussion of attachment relationship with own children or an imagined child

**Sample Questions from the AAI**

1. Help me get oriented to your family...
3-4. Give five adjectives to describe your relationship with your mother/father during childhood...
8. Did you ever feel rejected as a child?...
13. Have you experienced the loss of a parent or other close loved one?...
15. What is your relationship with your parents like for you currently?

### AAI Analysis and Coding

**AAI Analysis and Coding**

The verbatim transcript of an interview is analyzed and coded using the Main et al. Adult Attachment Scoring and Classification System (2002). This system includes two major types of scales: experience scales and state-of-mind scales.

**Experience Scales**:

1. **Loving**: Rates parental behavior described during the interview, with high scores given for active loving and deep acceptance of the child, physical affection, and individuality. Low scores are given for consistent unsupportiveness and lack of response to the child's individuality.
2. **Rejecting**: Based on descriptions of parents rejecting the child's attachment behaviors, such as actively turning away when the child sought contact.
3. **Involving/Role-reversing**: Rates the extent to which parents involve the child in their state of mind rather than being attentive to and regulating the child's state of mind. High scores indicate consistent expectation for the child to involve themselves in the parent's state of mind, interfering with emotion regulation and self-development.
4. **Neglect**: Refers to a parent's inattention and unresponsiveness to the child despite being physically present and potentially available.
5. **Pressure to Achieve**: Rates the degree to which parents show a consistent pattern of pushing the child to succeed or demanding adult responsibilities.

**State-of-Mind Scales**:

1. **Coherence of Discourse**: Assesses the overall consistency and clarity of the speaker's discourse about attachment themes in relation to the questions and context of the interview. High coherence is associated with secure attachment and mental health, while low coherence is linked to insecure attachment, relationship disturbance, and psychopathology.
2. **Coherence of Mind**: Assesses the speaker's current state of mind regarding attachment.
3. **Quality of Speech**: Evaluates the apparent truthfulness and consistency of what is said, as well as the evidence offered to validate it. High speech quality is demonstrated by clear examples from memory that back up given adjectives.
4. **Quantity of Speech**: Assesses the amount of speech appropriate in response to each AAI question. Dismissing attachment speakers offer too little speech, while preoccupied attachment speakers violate the maxim of quantity by saying too much.
5. **Relevance**: Evaluates how consistent a speaker's response is with the question or prompt and staying on topic.
6. **Manner**: Assesses the clarity and coherence of speech, including vagueness, jargon, contentless words, and incomplete sentences or statements.

A transcript is considered highly coherent when attachment experiences are described accurately with sufficient evidence, there is an appropriate amount of detail, the speaker stays on track with clear descriptions, and they demonstrate metacognitive monitoring (awareness of their approach to the interview process). Secure interviewees also show this metacognitive awareness.

**Idealization State-of-Mind Scale**

- Relevant to determination of dismissing attachment status
- Speaker attempts to fabricate account of excellent parenting or unrealistically happy childhood
- Evidence supplied during AAI is insufficient or contradictory to unrealistically positive view
- Dismissing interviewees typically show high idealization
- Present highly idealized yet unsupported view of primary attachment figures as a way to distance themselves from attachment themes
- May also show Insistence on Lack of Memory or recall regarding attachment-related experiences
  - Reported lack of memory serves to block further exploration of the topic

**Derogation Scale**

- Relevant to dismissing attachment
- Speaker actively and directly derogates attachment experiences as a way of dismissing or minimizing them

**Involving Anger Scale** (relevant to preoccupied attachment)

- Speaker indicates past and/or present anger toward an attachment figure
- Speaks at excessive length about it with poor ability to focus, excessive detail, and attempts to elicit interviewer's agreement
- Passages exemplifying involving anger may include a back-and-forth canned exchange between speaker and parent that seems to have been replayed in the same way many times

**Passivity Scale** (relevant to preoccupied attachment)

- Relevant to exploration of important losses and traumatic or abusive experiences in childhood
- Ratings made on several scales to assess temporary disorganization of state of mind when interviewee is describing an important loss or traumatic experience
- Temporary alterations in consciousness or working memory that occur when interviewee is exploring the trauma or loss experience

**Loss**

- Significant failures of monitoring of reasoning, such as speaking as though deceased person is still alive, expressing belief that interviewee caused death, and becoming confused about time and place of death or funeral
- Unusual attention to detail about death or funeral, prolonged silence, incomplete exploration, and invasion of loss into other parts of interview

**Trauma or Child Physical or Sexual Abuse**

- Significant failures of interviewee's monitoring of reasoning, such as denial of abuse, thinking interviewee caused it to happen, thinking abuser still has influence, and blocking topic from consciousness
- Unfinished exploration of topic, odd associations, intrusive images while describing trauma or abuse

**Lapses in Discourse** (given weight in overall rating of unresolved/disorganized state of mind)

- Temporary alterations in consciousness or working memory that occur during interview
- Significant failures of monitoring of reasoning and discourse when interviewee is exploring trauma, loss, or attachment themes.

### AAI Attachment Classifications

The Attachment Interview (AAI) uses state-of-mind measures to determine attachment types, correlating with the Strange Situation (SS) assessment.

**Secure/Autonomous (F)**

- Corresponds to secure/autonomous (B) in SS
- High coherence of discourse
- Explores attachment themes with fresh speech
- Values attachment
- Metacognitive monitoring
- Thoughtful, reflective, and forgiving of parental limitations

**Dismissing (Ds)**

- Corresponds to avoidant (A) in SS
- Downplays influence of attachment relationships
- Presents strong, normal, independent self
- Idealizes parents
- Minimizes negative experiences and emotions
- Poor quality and quantity of speech

**Preoccupied (E)**

- Corresponds to resistant/ambivalent (C) in SS
- Excessively lengthy descriptions of attachment experiences
- Filled with vague, meaningless passages
- Psychological jargon and canned speech
- Lacks freshness

**Unresolved/Disorganized (Ud)**

- Corresponds to disorganized/disoriented (D) in SS
- With respect to loss or trauma/abuse

**Advantages of AAI Scoring Approach**

- Honors continuous nature of attachment patterns
- Allows for subclassifications within main classifications

**Subclassifications**

**Secure (F)**

- **F3**: Prototype of secure attachment
- **F1 or F2**: Secure with some degree of dismissing attachment
- **F4 or F5**: Secure with some degree of preoccupied attachment

**Insecure Dismissing (Ds)**

- Low coherence of transcript
- More or less severe dismissing characteristics
- **Ds1**: Severely dismissing
- **Ds2**: Derogatory dismissing
- **Ds3**: Less severe dismissing with some signs of valuing attachment

**Insecure Preoccupied (E)**

- Variations in nature of preoccupation
- **E1**: High passivity
- **E2**: Angry preoccupation
- **E3**: Fearful preoccupation

**Attachment Theory: Cannot Classify (CC) Category**

The Attachment and Interview Schedule (AAI) manual by Main et al. (2002) includes a "Cannot Classify" (CC) category for individuals who do not exhibit a predominant attachment style due to the absence of a single state-of-mind or evidence of multiple, contradictory attachment types. The CC category has not been empirically established in relation to infant Strange Situation behavior patterns.

Our perspective:

- Both unresolved/disorganized (Ud) and CC types are associated with disorganized/disoriented (D) category from Strange Situation procedure coding.
- The main difference between Ud and CC is the pervasiveness of disorganization, not disorganization itself.

Reasons for underdevelopment of CC:

- The AAI was not extensively used to assess clinical populations with severe psychopathology until recently.
- Norms for a more complete subtyping of CC have not been met due to limited research on this category in clinical samples.

CC subcategories:

1. **Contradictory strategies CC**: A mixture of dismissing and anxious-preoccupied attachment strategies.
2. **Low coherence CC**: Pervasive disorganization and low coherence throughout the interview.
3. **Dissociative identity disorder (DID) and borderline patients**: Patients oscillate between different attachment strategies depending on which alter personality state or ego state is present.
4. **Multiple caregivers**: Individuals with multiple, contradictory attachment strategies across multiple caregivers.
5. **Switching strategies**: Interviewees may begin the AAI interview with a single coherent strategy but switch to a different strategy by the end.
6. **Pervasive fear**: Transcripts characterized by pervasive fear and very low coherence of discourse throughout the text.
7. **Refusal or inability to cooperate**: Interviewees who refuse to cooperate or are unable to do the interview, providing insufficient information for attachment pattern assessment.
8. **Lack of any attachment strategy**: Transcripts that show an apparent lack of any attachment strategy whatsoever.
9. **Extreme incoherence**: Interviews with extreme incoherence throughout the interview and little meaning or sense.

Importance of the five-way classification system:

- The CC category is frequently found in patients with personality and/or dissociative disorders.
- The five-way classification system is necessary for assessing attachment state of mind in patients with more severe psychopathology, such as personality and dissociative disorder patients.
- Many clinically important research studies report that borderlines have predominantly preoccupied attachment, but this may be an artifact of not having the CC category available.
- Using a full five-way classification system is crucial for clinical practice to accurately assess attachment patterns in patients with severe psychopathology.

### Incorporating the AAI Into Clinical Practice

The Attachment Interview (AAI) is recommended for assessing attachment in adults in clinical populations due to its ability to detect and understand internal working models for attachment. The AAI provides extensive information about a patient's state of mind with respect to attachment.

**Advantages of Using the AAI**:
- Assesses state of mind regarding attachment, essential for understanding patients' internal working models.
- Provides clinicians with comprehensive information about a patient's attachment style.

**Disadvantages of Using the AAI**:
- Requires significant time investment in training to develop interviewing and scoring reliability and validity.

**AAI Training**:
1. **Two-week intensive class**:
   - Learn all experience and state-of-mind scales.
   - Determine main attachment strategy and subclassifications.
2. **Practice period**:
   - Receive 30 practice AAI transcripts with scoring illustrated for some.
   - Complete scoring information across all parental and state-of-mind scales.
3. **Three-year certification process**:
   - Score 36 more transcripts.
   - Achieve inter-judge agreement of at least 80% with Mary Main and Eric Hesse's classifications to earn scoring certification.

**Evidence of Reliability and Validity**:
- **Inter-judge agreement on main AAI attachment classifications**: 82% (Hesse, 1999).

**Alternative Approach for Clinicians**:
1. Administer the AAI.
2. Have audio recordings transcribed verbatim.
3. Send transcripts to a fully trained and certified AAI scorer for scoring and detailed report.
4. Pay a scoring fee for the service.

**Conclusion**:
The AAI is an essential tool for assessing attachment in adults, especially in clinical populations. Although the training process requires a considerable time investment, it offers comprehensive information about a patient's state of mind regarding attachment. Alternatively, clinicians can administer the AAI and have transcripts scored by certified scorers.

### THE AAI Q-SORT SCORING SYSTEM

**AAI Q-Sort Scoring System**

- An alternative way to score the Attachment Anxiety Inventory (AAI) is through the use of the Q-sort methodology (Kobak, 1989/1993; Waters & Deane, 1985).

**Q-Set**

- Consists of 100 behaviorally descriptive items derived from AAI scales.
- Items describe different aspects of interview transcripts including information-processing features, emotion regulation, and working models of self and parents.
- Printed on cards that are sorted into nine piles based on their characteristic level during the interview.

**Sorting the Q-Sets**

- Items most characteristic of an interviewee's discourse are placed at one end (Piles 9, 8, and 7).
- Items least characteristic are placed at the opposite end (Piles 3, 2, and 1).
- Items neither characteristic nor uncharacteristic are placed in the center piles.

**Scoring Q-Sets**

- Can be scored at the level of individual items and also in terms of broadly defined constructs like security, dependency, sociability.
- Associated with particular attachment prototypes.

**Attachment Prototypes and Examples of Items**

- **Secure Attachment**: "Is comfortable with the interview and responds in a clear, well-organized fashion," "The relationship with the other was relaxed and comfortable."
- **Dismissing Attachment**: "Provided only minimum responses," "Maintained an unemotional demeanor throughout the interview."
- **Preoccupied Attachment**: "Has fears of loss or abandonment by parent," "Described a history of multiple romantic relationships."

**Continuous Assessment vs. Discrete Classification**

- Continuous assessment has advantages over discrete, prototypical assessment and classification in statistical evaluations.
- Allows for recognition of overlap or continuity among attachment patterns.

**Three-Category Differentiation**

- Derive three-category differentiation (secure, dismissing, preoccupied) from Q-sort data with an 80% overlap between AAI and Q-sort classifications.

**Practical Considerations for Clinicians**

- Traditional AAI scoring approach using ratings on the AAI scales to determine main prototype and subtype of attachment state of mind is most practical for most clinicians.

### THE DYNAMIC-MATURATIONAL MODEL (DMM) METHODS OF ASSESSMENT

Patricia Crittenden's Dynamic-Maturational Model (DMM) is an advancement over traditional attachment assessment methods, such as the George, Kaplan, and Main (1996) AAI and Main and Goldwyn (1984a, 1994) classificatory system. The DMM:

- Expands on the groundbreaking work of Main and Goldwyn (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 17).
- Uses a structured interview called the DMM-AAI with questions eliciting wider range of information (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 7).
- Includes many more and different subcategories in its discourse coding system (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 46).

**DMM Assessment System**

The DMM assessment system:

- Addresses patterns of attachment behavior beyond the range described by Ainsworth (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 18).
- Includes additional attachment strategies and patterns that may emerge during preschool, school, adolescent, and adult years, as well as in extreme situations (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 35).
- Expands and updates traditional methods while not being in conflict with them (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 46).

**DMM Assessment Methods**

Crittenden developed her system to reflect integral aspects of understanding patterns of attachment behavior and their underlying dynamics:

- Believes traditional methods do not address this dimension (Crittenden & Landini, 2011).
- Offers DMM methods as an expansion and updating of the traditional methods (Crittenden & Landini, 2011).

**Benefits for Clinical Populations**

The expanded assessment and classification system is particularly beneficial when considering clinical populations:

- Developed from a broader sampling of AAIs (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 18).
- Yields a larger set of coding classifications that permits greater differentiation among individuals with psychological disorders (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 332).

**DMM Classifications**

In the DMM system:

- There are 22 possible classifications of adult discourse patterns (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, pp. 236–253).
- 12 possible forms of "unresolved loss" (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 386).
- 14 possible forms of "unresolved trauma" (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 387).

**DMM and Conflicting Attachment Patterns**

Crittenden does not find value in D and CC classifications:

- Believes they indicate a lack of recognition that the presence of multiple and seemingly conflicting attachment patterns actually reflects an organized strategy (Crittenden & Landini, 2011).
- Identifies such strategies as particular combinations of discourse patterns that appear in the interview transcript.

### The DMM-AAI

**The DMM-AAI (Dynamic Maturational Model Attachment Interview) by Crittenden**

* Modification of the AAI (Attachment Anxiety and Avoidance Inventory) by Crittenden (2007)
* Includes more questions to elicit information from various memory systems and salient issues of adulthood
* Maintains overall sequence and importance of careful administration
* Unpublished, available to qualified researchers and clinicians

**DMM Classification Methods**

* Coding manual for the DMM classification system (Crittenden & Landini, 2011)
* Evaluates coherence of discourse and identifies patterns related to parental rejection, neglect, role reversal, pressure to achieve, and involvement
* No rating scales; all transcript information considered in context
* Complex pattern recognition for classification

**DMM Classification of Attachment Strategies**

* **Emphasizes two primary information-processing strategies**: cognitive (contingency-based) and affective (experiential)
* Five B, or Balanced, categories reflecting varying degrees of both forms of information

**B Categories**

* Speakers who describe childhood experiences using both cognition and affect
* **B3**: Comfortably balanced (widest range of mental, behavioral, and discourse strategies)
* **B1 and B2**: Slightly emphasize cognitive information (closer to A patterns)
* **B4 and B5**: Slightly emphasize affective information (closer to C patterns)

**Odd and Even Category Numbering**

* **Odd-numbered strategies**: outward focus on attachment figures, tendency to idealize
* **Even-numbered strategies**: inward focus on self-experience, tendency to negate self
* **B1 and odd-numbered A strategies**: idealization of attachment figure
* **B2 and even-numbered A strategies**: negation of self
* **B4 and even-numbered C strategies**: fear and desire for comfort
* **B5 and odd-numbered C strategies**: angry affect and expression

**Crittenden's Attachment Classification: Type A Strategies**

**Type A Strategies**: Adults using these strategies present idealized descriptions of their parents in response to questions from the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). They demonstrate moderate to low coherence and tend to speak in an orderly manner but provide insufficient quantity and poor quality speech, particularly about negative aspects of attachment figures and positive aspects of self.

**Idealization and Mental Stereotyping**: Type A speakers use words reflecting idealization and mental stereotyping to maintain the idealization of their parents. They often present similar positive qualities that may be synonyms, use the same or very similar words for both mother and father, and employ absolute enhancers like "always" and "never."

**Defensive Splitting**: This results from children not experiencing significant threat of physical danger but consistently not receiving comfort or experiencing overt rejection of attachment behavior. The good and bad qualities of the parent are split, with only the good acknowledged and negative affect inhibited (dissociated).

**Coherence**: Type A speakers tend to demonstrate moderate to low coherence when evaluated using Grice's four maxims. They have difficulty recalling examples from their experience that illustrate the descriptive words given due to compromised episodic memory.

**A1 and A2 Strategies**: These strategies, also referred to as dismissing attachment in the context of physical safety, result when children do not receive comfort or experience overt rejection of attachment behavior but are actually safe. They correspond to Ainsworth's A1 and Main et al.'s Ds1 and Ds3.

**A3 to A8 Strategies**: These strategies, also referred to as dismissing in the context of danger, result when parents are the source of danger or fail to protect children from danger and if the danger is predictable and preventable. They correspond to Ainsworth's A2 and Main et al.'s Ds3, but Crittenden's A3 to A8 categories are unique offerings based on her readings and clinical observations.

**Defense Against Negative Affect**: Across the lower-to-higher A-strategy spectrum, speakers show increasing negation of negative affective response of all kinds up to lack of response to pain. A1 and A2 speakers inhibit negative affect; A3 and A4 speakers substitute false positive affect for inhibited negative affect; A5 and A6 speakers deny significance of physiological discomfort while continuing inhibition and falsification as needed; and A7 and A8 speakers deny perception of pain while sometimes adding delusional positive affects and continuing inhibition and falsification as needed.

**Type C Strategies**: These strategies have affect—feeling states and levels of arousal—as their basis and organization. Type C speakers use affect to organize their psychological processes, self-processes, and self-protective behavior. They display nonverbal indicators of high arousal and images of scary, irritating, or comforting contexts.

**Affect States**: The three primary affect states that motivate behavior for Type C speakers are anger, fear, and desire for comfort. These conflicting affect states are managed by "splitting" the mixed feelings associated with arousal and displaying one part in an exaggerated manner while inhibiting the competing feelings.

**DMM Classification of C Strategies**: The odd-numbered strategies indicate that a speaker's AAI discourse tends toward gradations of angry affect and its expression, whereas the even-numbered strategies reflect the relative prevalence of fear and desire for comfort.

**Type C Patterns in Attachment**:

**Characteristics**:

- Preoccupation with self and dismissing others in relationships
- Focus on own feelings, wants, and needs
- Coercive strategy to elicit comfort and protection from attachment figures
- Privileging of affective information over temporal and causal aspects
- Blurring of boundaries between person, place, and time
- Use of vague and imprecise language
- Low coherence in speech

**Discourse Patterns**:

*Involving discourse:*
  - Talk about past experiences in a rush of arousing words
  - Few but intense words to capture attention without reaching a conclusion
  - Expect interviewers to supply needed words and thoughts
  - Seek interviewers' agreement with their perspectives
  - Attempt to engage interviewers in psychological collusion against others or suspect collusion against themselves

**Impact of Early Childhood Experiences**:

- Unpredictable care from attachment figures
- Parents' indecisive love and unpredictability leads to fear, anger, and desire for comfort
- Basis for Ainsworth's C1 (threateningly angry) and C2 (disarmingly desirous of comfort) infant patterns

**High-Numbered Type C Patterns**:

*C3 to C8 (obsessive strategies):*
  - Consumed by a single perspective, excluding conflicting motivations
  - Angry invulnerability in odd-numbered strategies
  - Desire for comfort and fear in even-numbered strategies
  - Very little to no manifestation of fear and desire for comfort
  - Pugnacious veneer of bravado to cover feelings of vulnerability and desire for comfort

**Comparison with Other Attachment Categories**:

- Crittenden's C1 and C2 patterns similar to Main and Goldwyn's E2 preoccupied and angry pattern and E1 preoccupied passive pattern, respectively
- C1 and C2 operate as a pair, attempting to coerce comfort and protection from attachment figures through exaggerated displays of anger and desire for comfort with some fear
- High-numbered C strategies (C3 to C8) not corresponding to any of Ainsworth's or Main and Goldwyn's categories, based on observations of preschool-age children's behavior and theory.

**Crittenden's Attachment Classification System: Strategies and Modifiers**

**Strategies**:

* **Even-numbered strategies**: privilege vulnerable affect and expression, inhibit and exclude anger (B4 to A7-8)
* **Type C speakers**: engage in distortions of information that maintain their perspectives and dismiss those of others
* **C1-C8**: different levels of fear and desire for comfort, with varying degrees of omission and distortion of information
* **Types A/C and AC**: combinations of A (cognition-privileging) and C (affect-privileging) strategies
* **Alternating (A/C) strategies**: use any combination from both low-and high-numbered patterns for different attachment figures or situations
* **AC blended strategy**: greater integration of affect-privileging and cognition-privileging information-processing patterns, but with some omission and distortion of information
* **Psychopathic AC speakers (A7-8C7-8)**: can appear like balanced speakers but are highly vigilant and nonspontaneous

**Modifiers**:

* **Depressed (Dp)**: speaker is aware that strategies are not resolving problems and self and actions are irrelevant to outcomes
* **Disoriented (DO)**: significant verbal inconsistencies, discrepancies, and disruptions in speakers with combination patterns
* **Intrusions of forbidden negative affect**: sudden change from inhibited state to high arousal with unacceptable language or forms of address
* **Expressed somatic symptoms**: nonverbal behaviors that disrupt communication during AAI, cannot be explained by medical conditions
* **Reorganizing**: speakers changing from one strategy to another, neither strategy functions fully, classificatory criteria are mixed and not fully met.

**Classification System**:

* Allows for specification of information-processing strategies that in Main et al.'s system would likely be categorized as disorganized (D) or cannot classify (CC)
* Some transcripts may not fit any B, A, C, or combination patterns and are labeled "insecure other" (IO), to be set aside for reconsideration
* Importance placed on identifying past traumas and losses as resolved or unresolved, with 26 possible subtypes of unresolved trauma and loss.

**Assessment**:

* George et al.'s AAI is better at eliciting evidence for preoccupying lack of resolution than dismissed forms
* DMM-AAI obtains information that can more clearly identify both forms and their subtypes
* Recognition of five modifiers that disrupt and render less effective the strategies established by a speaker.

### Incorporating the DMM Into Clinical Practice

**Incorporating the DMM (Dynamic-Maturational Model) Into Clinical Practice**

The DMM system of assessment is considered an alternative or supplement to the traditional Attachment Interview (AAI) by some clinicians. The DMM offers a greater number of classifications that finely differentiate and specify attachment strategies based on information-processing patterns developed in response to experiences of threat/danger. However, this system requires a shift from thinking about attachment in terms of prototypes to focusing on specific adaptive strategies used in attachment contexts, as well as extensive training for proficiency and reliability.

**Contributions of the DMM System**:

- Greater differentiation and specificity of attachment strategies
- Finer-grained understanding of what underlies traditional prototypes
- Assists in individualizing treatment

**Challenges with the DMM System**:

- **Complexity**: Many potential classification categories, making interrater reliability more challenging
- Extensive training is necessary for proficiency and reliability
- Regular coding and classification practice, periodic recertification, and avoiding conditions that decrease reliability

**Limitations of the DMM Assessment and Classification Method**:

- Less well known and less frequently used than the traditional AAI approach
- Wider acceptance awaits further academic studies
- Fewer research studies using the DMM and its assessment system compared to the extensive traditional AAI literature

**Comparison with Traditional AAI Approach**:

- **Simplicity**: Four prototypical primary attachment patterns along with unresolved classification
- Well-established research-based knowledge
- Preferable for clinicians who do not want to invest in DMM training or whose treatment methods do not require the specificity provided through the DMM system

**Future of Attachment Research and Practice**:

- Continued research and practice emerging from both models will lead to broader and deeper understanding about attachment
- Benefits from seeing and respecting the unique aspects and strengths and limitations of each model and approach. (Fonagy, 2013)

**Treatment Approaches**:

- The traditional AAI has not generated major new ideas or recommendations for differential treatment approaches in more than two decades (Crittenden & Landini, 2011)
- Crittenden and Landini propose the "Three Pillars" treatment, strongly derived from the original AAI and its classification system.

### THE CURRENT RELATIONSHIP INTERVIEW (CRI)

The CRI is a clinical tool designed to assess an individual's state of mind with respect to attachment in their current adult romantic partnership, modeled after the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). It was developed by Crowell and Owens to explore how new attachments are integrated into existing representations or how new representations develop.

**Purpose and Development**

- Reveals mental representation of attachments in adult romantic relationships
- Parallels the AAI but questions reflect reciprocal nature of adult relationships
- Intended to assess adult attachment within close relationships
- May reveal characteristics of multiple attachment classifications due to influences from past family experiences, previous romantic relationships, and current partner behavior

**Assessment Process**

1. **Thorough history of family relationships**: quality of parent's marriage, loving or unloving parents, nature of conflict, interviewee's exposure to conflict
2. **Previous romantic relationships**: how each relationship began, intensity, and ending
3. **Current romantic relationship**: in-depth exploration, adjectives used to describe the relationship, degree of satisfaction
4. Experience scales and current-state-of-mind scales are made from interview transcripts

**Evaluation Scales**

1. **Loving score**: assesses loving behavior, supportive, available, responsive, secure base
2. **Negative behavior scales**: Rejecting, Involving, Controlling, Dependency, Communication
3. **Safe Haven assessment**: caregiving and care-seeking for both partners
4. **Current state of mind with respect to attachment to the partner**: Valuing Intimacy, Valuing Independence, Angry Speech, Derogation, Idealization, Passive Speech, Fear of Loss of Partner, unresolved/disorganized states of mind

**Classification System**

- **Secure (S)**: S1, S2, S3
- **Dismissing (D)**: D1, D2, D3, D4
- **Preoccupied (P)**: P1, P2, P3, P4
- Unresolved/disorganized

**Comparison with AAI**

The CRI is considered a more thorough and useful tool for evaluating state of mind in current romantic relationships compared to the AAI. The AAI was designed to classify attachment prototypes comparable to Strange Situation prototypes for children, but adult romantic involvements are more complex. Findings from research suggest that factors other than attachment security play a role in partner selection and maintenance. Little relation between broad constructs of marital satisfaction and AAI classification has been found, but feelings of intimacy are related.

**Significant Differences Between AAI and CRI**

Some authors argue that the differences between the AAI and related interview measures and measures of adult romantic attachment should be further considered. The AAI focuses on adults' characterizations of their childhood relationships with parents, while measures focusing on experiences in romantic relationships are distinct.

### THE ADULT ATTACHMENT PROJECTIVE PICTURE SYSTEM (AAP)

- Assessment approach measuring attachment coherence, representing integration of attachment and caregiving relationships
- Based on evaluation of narrative structure and content of responses to a set of eight images
- Visual projective tool designed to elicit attachment-related themes

**AAP Stimulus Set**

- **Consists of eight cards**: Neutral, Child at Window, Departure, Bench, Bed, Ambulance, Cemetery, and Child in Corner
- Participant asked to describe picture and imagine what led up to the scene and what will happen next

**Assessment Process**

- Focus on overall patterns of story content and defensive processing elements in responses to attachment stimuli
- Analysis of defenses in relation to attachment is central to classification

**Attachment Categories in AAP Classification System**

- **Secure**: Presence of internalized secure base and haven of safety, sensitivity or goal-corrected synchrony
- **Dismissing**: Predominance of deactivating defenses, exclusion of attachment-related thoughts and affects
- **Preoccupied**: Predominance of cognitive disconnection without deactivation, non-integrated attachment information, uncertainty
- **Unresolved**: Evidence of segregated systems (dysregulation or constricted immobilization) due to unresolved loss or trauma

**Defensive Exclusion**

- Both secure and insecure individuals use defenses
- **Secure individuals**: Defense acts as a sorting mechanism, transforming and excluding attachment affect experience to support integration
- **Insecure individuals**: Defense takes on an exclusionary role, blocking attachment distress

**Attachment Status Classification Based on AAP**

- Strong association with AAI classifications
- **Limitations**: Time investment for scoring competence, lack of research on use in clinical populations, no information about attachment prototype subclassifications.

### Self-Report Based Assessment PEER AND PARENTAL ATTACHMENT IN ADOLESCENCE

**Self-Report Based Assessment of Peer and Parental Attachment in Adolescence**

* Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (Armsden & Greenberg, 1987) is a widely used self-report inventory to assess adolescent attachment to peers and parents.
* **It evaluates parental and peer attachment in three categories**:
  * **Degree of mutual trust**: examples include "My parents respect my feelings" for parents and "I trust my friends" for peers.
  * **Quality of communication**: examples include "I like to get my mother’s point of view on things I am concerned about" for parents and "My friends listen to what I have to say" for peers.
  * **Degree of anger/alienation**: examples include "My mother expects too much of me" for parents and "Talking over my problems with my friends makes me feel ashamed or foolish" for peers.
* Studies using this measure show positive correlations between the quality of parent and peer attachments in adolescents and self-esteem, life satisfaction, and other measures of wellbeing (Crowell et al., 1999).

**The Prototype Approach – Romantic Attachment**

* Hazen and Shaver (1987, 1990) developed a forced-choice self-report assessment of adult romantic relationships based on Ainsworth et al.’s (1978) three-way typology of attachment patterns in infancy.
* **The love-experience questionnaire consists of a single item with three prototypical descriptions of adult romantic relationship behavior**: secure, avoidant, and anxious/ambivalent.
* Respondents choose the one that best fits their experience.
* Initial findings showed 56% secure, 19% anxious/ambivalent, and 25% avoidant distribution (Hazen & Shaver, 1987).
* Secure lovers describe their most important love experience as especially happy, friendly, and trusting.
* Avoidant lovers were characterized by fear of intimacy, emotional highs and lows, and jealousy.
* Anxious/ambivalent subjects experienced love as involving obsession, desire for reciprocation and union, emotional highs and lows, and extreme sexual attraction and jealousy.

**Limitations of the Forced-Choice Prototype Approach**

* A limitation of the forced-choice prototype approach is that it does not allow for more than one attachment classification (Levy & Davis, 1988).
* Some people may show different attachment styles in different relationships.
* Requiring a forced choice of one attachment type does not allow for the detection of multiple internal working models of attachment.

**Continuous Rating Scales of Adult Romantic Relationships**

* To address these limitations, some researchers developed continuous rating scales based on the Hazen and Shaver single-item prompt.
* The Adult Attachment Scale (AAS) consists of 18 questionnaire items that are rated in a Likert scale format.
* **Factor analysis of the AAS revealed three factors**: closeness, dependency, and anxiety.
* These factors do not correspond well to the three Hazen and Shaver attachment prototypes.
* Collins and Read suggest that self-report questionnaires of adult romantic attachment need to address a wider variance of attachment style than can be depicted by single-item or few-item assessments (Collins & Read, 1994).

### Attachment Style (AS)

**Attachment Style**

- **Criticisms against Hazen and Shaver's single item assessment tool (1990) by Simpson (1990)**:
  * Meaningful individual difference variability within each category cannot be assessed
  * Some adults may exhibit a blend of two or more styles
- **Simpson's response**: Decomposed the prototype item and created a 13-item assessment tool

**Assessment Tool**:

- Items rated on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 10 = strongly agree)
- **Sample items**: "I find it relatively easy to get close to others," "I am nervous whenever anyone gets close to me," "I often worry that my partner(s) don't really love me" (p. 973)

**Secure Attachment Style**:

- **Characterized by higher levels of**:
  * Interdependence
  * Trust
  * Commitment
  * Satisfaction in relationships
- Associated with more positive emotion and less negative emotion within relationships (p. 977)

**Insecure Attachment Styles**:

- **Anxious attachment style**:
  * Relationships defined by opposite set of features compared to secure attachment style
  * More negative emotion and less positive emotion within relationships
- **Avoidant attachment style**:
  * Relationships defined by opposite set of features compared to secure attachment style
  * More negative emotion and less positive emotion within relationships

**Summary**:

Simpson (1990) criticized Hazen and Shaver's single item assessment tool for attachment styles, arguing that it couldn't capture meaningful individual difference variability and that some adults might exhibit a blend of two or more styles. In response, Simpson created a 13-item assessment tool to measure attachment styles on a 7-point Likert scale. The secure attachment style is characterized by higher levels of interdependence, trust, commitment, satisfaction, and positive emotion in relationships. In contrast, the anxious and avoidant attachment styles are associated with opposite sets of features and lower levels of positive emotion and higher levels of negative emotion within relationships.

### The Adult Style Questionnaire (ASQ) 

**The Adult Style Questionnaire (ASQ)**

- Developed by Feeney and Noller (1990) and Feeney, Noller, and Hanrahan (1994)
- Based on Hazen and Shaver prototype item
- Decomposed into 65 items
- Principal component analysis reduced final set to a 40-item scale

**Background and Purpose**

- Suitable for young adolescents with little or no experience in romantic relationships (Feeney, Noller, & Hanrahan, 1994)

**Factor Analysis**

- **Three-factor solution**: Secure, Anxious, Avoidant
- **Five-factor solution**: Need for Approval, Preoccupation with Relationships, Discomfort with Closeness, Relationships as Secondary, Confidence

**Five-Factor Solution Explanation**

- **Anxiety breaks up into**:
  * Need for Approval
  * Preoccupation with Relationships
- **Avoidance tends to break up into**:
  * Discomfort with Closeness
  * Relationships as Secondary

**Conclusion**

- Distinct types of insecurely attached individuals can be identified, especially among young adults with limited romantic relationship experience (Feeney, Noller, & Hanrahan, 1994)

### The Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) 

**The Relationship Questionnaire (RQ)**

- Developed by Brennan, Shaver, and Tobey (1991) as an alternative to Hazen and Shaver's prototype measure
- **Four prototypes**: secure, dismissing, preoccupied, and fearful

**Prototype Descriptions**

*Secure:*
  - Easy to become emotionally close to others
  - Comfortable depending on others and having them depend on you
  - No worry about being alone or unaccepted

*Dismissing:*
  - Comfortable without close emotional relationships
  - Value independence and self-sufficiency
  - Prefer not to depend on others or have them depend on you

*Preoccupied:*
  - Want complete emotional intimacy with others
  - Uncomfortable being without close relationships
  - Sometimes worry that others don't value them as much

*Fearful:*
  - Somewhat uncomfortable getting close to others
  - Want emotionally close relationships but find it difficult to trust
  - Worry about being hurt if they allow themselves to become too close

**Prototype Classification**

- **Two dimensions**: self versus other and positive versus negative
- **Secure**: Positive self and positive other
- **Preoccupied**: Positive other and negative self
- **Dismissing**: Positive self and negative other
- **Fearful**: Negative self and negative other

**Bartholomew and Horowitz's Categories**

- Divided Hazen and Shaver's avoidant category into fearfully avoidant and dismissing avoidant
- Dismissing avoidance on the RQ differs from Hazen and Shaver's avoidant description
- Fearful category on the RQ is similar to CC category on the AAI and Strange Situation's A/C combination

**Individual Variability and Limitations**

- Most subjects reported a mix of tendencies across time and relationships
- No subject uniquely fit any one attachment prototype
- Considerable individual variability was lost when the four continuous ratings were collapsed into a simple, four-category classification

**Factor Analysis**

- Brennan, Clark, and Shaver (1998) conducted a factor analysis of 60 attachment subscales across existing measures
- Found a two-factor solution with main factors being avoidance of intimacy and anxiety about romantic involvement
- Simpson and Rholes (1998) concluded that these two dimensions underlie virtually all self-report adult romantic attachment measures

**The Relationship Scales Questionnaire (RSQ)**

- Developed as a refinement of the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) and the Adult Attachment Scale
- Resulted from attempts to identify underlying structure through factor or cluster analysis
- Designed to yield various attachment subscales

**Components of RSQ**

- Includes items from Love Quiz, Relationship Questionnaire, and Adult Attachment Scale
- Each item scored on a 5-point scale ranging from "not at all like me" to "very much like me"

**Attachment Subscales in RSQ**

*Secure Attachment*
- **Example statement**: "I find it relatively easy to get close to others"

*Avoidant Attachment*
- **Example statement**: "I am nervous when anyone gets too close to me"

*Ambivalent Attachment*
- **Example statement**: "I find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like"

*Fearful Attachment*
- **Example statement**: "I worry that I will be hurt if I allow myself to become too close to others"

**Findings from RSQ Research**

- Overall results failed to find clear evidence for attachment categories (Fraley & Waller, 1998)

### Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR) 

**Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR)**

* By the late 1990s, researchers were overwhelmed by self-report measures of adult romantic attachment.
* Despite this, the structure of adult romantic attachment was becoming clearer.
* **Factor analyses identified a two-dimensional typology**: anxiety and avoidance.

**Attachment-related Anxiety**

* Captures insecurity about partner's availability, love, and responsiveness.
* **Examples of items**: "I am afraid I will lose my partner's love," "I worry that my partner doesn't really know me."

**Attachment-related Avoidance**

* Refers to strategies used for regulating attachment behavior, thought, and affect.
* **Examples of items**: "I prefer not to show a partner how I feel deep down," "I find it difficult to trust my partner."

**Experience in Close Relationships Scale (ECR)**

* Developed based on empirically derived set of items for anxious and avoidant attachment.
* Consists of 36 items (18 for each dimension).
* Scaled using a 7-point Likert scale.
* Widely recognized as one of the best self-report instruments for assessing adult romantic attachment.

**Interview vs. Self-Report Assessment**

* Assessments of current attachment state of mind by AAI and self-report measures are weakly correlated (average .15).
* **Possible causes**:
  * AAI evaluates state of mind, self-report measures obtain conscious reporting.
  * AAI assesses relatively narrow range of behaviors compared to self-report measures.
  * Healthy adults have greater range and flexibility of attachment behaviors.

### Recommendations

* **For clinical populations**: use AAI and related measures to evaluate stable, single state of mind with respect to attachment.
* **For healthier patients**: use ECR-R along with a wider range of intimacy and relational measures to create greater range and flexibility of intimate behaviors.
* At this point, ECR-R is the most suitable measure for detecting avoidant/deactivating and anxious/hyperactivating behaviors in adult romantic relationships.

### Assessment of Attachment-Related Behaviors in Treatment 

**Attachment-Related Behaviors in Treatment**

**Assessment Scales for Attachment in Therapy**

* **Two commonly used scales to assess attachment in therapy**: Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) and Client Attachment to Therapist Scale (CATS)

**Working Alliance Inventory (WAI)**

* Developed by Horvath and Greenberg (1989) to assess the working alliance between therapist and patient
* Defined as "what makes it possible for the patient to accept and follow treatment faithfully" (Bordin, 1980)
* **Consists of 36 items, measuring three areas**: bonds, goals, and tasks
* Each item rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not related, 5 = very related)
* Securely attached patients had higher working alliance than preoccupied or avoidant patients (Lyons-Ruth et al., 2007)
* Can be used throughout treatment to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic approach for insecurely attached patients

**Client Attachment to Therapist Scale (CATS)**

* Directly measures attachment bond between patient and therapist (Mallinckrodt et al., 1995; Woodhouse et al., 2003)
* Developed through a panel of experienced therapists and factor analysis
* **Three-factor solution**: Secure, Avoidant-Fearful, Preoccupied-Merger
* **Items from each scale**:
  * **Secure**: "My counselor is sensitive to my needs," "My counselor is a comforting presence to me when I am upset"
  * **Avoidant-Fearful**: "I think my counselor disapproves of me," "I don't like to share my feelings with my counselor"
  * **Preoccupied-Merger**: "I wish my counselor could be with me on a daily basis," "I wonder about my counselor's other clients"
* All items rated on a 6-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree)
* Detects both hyperactivating and deactivating behaviors in treatment (Woodhouse et al., 2003)
* More securely attached individuals better tolerate negative transference and overall amount of transference (Woodhouse et al., 2003)

**Research Findings on CATS**

* **Meta-analysis by Mallinckrodt and Jeong (2015)**:
  * **Attachment types significantly correlated with anxiety and avoidance**:
    + CATS security negatively associated with anxiety and avoidance
    + CATS avoidance positively correlated with both anxiety and avoidance
    + CATS preoccupation positively correlated with anxiety but not avoidance
  * **Attachment types significantly correlated with the working alliance**:
    + CATS security positively correlated with the working alliance
    + CATS avoidance negatively correlated with the working alliance
    + CATS preoccupation not significantly correlated with the working alliance
  * CATS captured variance not accounted for by WAI alone (Mallinckrodt et al., 2005)
* Clients with strong avoidance and anxiety in romantic relationships also showed strong avoidance and anxiety in their therapeutic attachments (Mallinckrodt et al., 2005)
* Security associated with greater depth and smoothness of exploration in treatment (Mallinckrodt et al., 2005)

### THE THERAPIST REPRESENTATIONAL INVENTORY (TRI)

**The Therapist Representation Inventory (TRI)**

The TRI is a tool used to assess the development of internal working models of attachment to the therapist as a secure base. It was developed by Geller, Behrends, Hartley, Farber, and Rohde (1992) and further explained by Geller and Farber (1993).

**Components and Structure of TRI**

- Consists of 50 items rated on a 9-point Likert scale.
- **Two subscales**:
  - **Therapist Embodiment Scale (TES)**: 12 items.
  - **Therapist Involvement Scale (TIS)**: 38 items.

**Therapist Embodiment Scale (TES)**

- Taps imagistic, enactive, and conversational aspects of the therapist representation.
- **Examples**:
  - **Imagistic**: "I imagine my therapist sitting in his/her office."
  - **Enactive**: "I am aware of a particular emotional atmosphere which gives me the sense that my therapist is with me."
  - **Conversational**: "I think of my therapist making specific statements to me."

**Therapist Involvement Scale (TIS)**

- Measures salience of discrete affective-interpersonal themes.
- **Taps various dimensions of therapist involvement, such as**:
  - **Physical**: "I imagine hurting my therapist in some way."
  - **Extratherapeutic**: "I imagine our talking to each other outside of therapy."
  - **Continuing therapeutic work**: "When I am faced with a difficult situation I sometimes ask myself what would my therapist want me to do?"
  - **Doubting the efficacy of treatment**: "I don’t think my therapy will have a lasting effect on me."
  - **Strengthening contact with the therapist and missing the therapist**: "I rehearse what I will say to my therapist when we meet again."
  - **Missing the therapist**: "I doubt that anyone can replace my therapist in my life."
- Includes 24 items assessing emotions associated with the internal representation of the therapist.

**Findings from TRI**

- Patients tend to develop a more available visual or imagistic representation of their attachment-based therapist the longer they are in treatment.
- Clients who use the therapist representation to continue the work of therapy feel comforted and safe when evoking this representation.
- **The number of sessions attended is related to preferred mode of representation**: the greater the number of sessions, the less frequent the use of a visual mode and the more frequent the use of conversational-conceptual mode.

## Chapter 5 Attachment and Psychopathology 
**Overview of Attachment and Psychopathology**

Mikulincer and Shaver (2007) explored the relationship between attachment and psychopathology. They discussed the role of attachment problems in causing psychopathology and the specific types of disorders associated with attachment insecurities.

**Limitations of Attachment Theory**

Ein-Dor and Doron (2015) highlighted the challenges in understanding how attachment issues lead to various disorders:

* **Multifinality**: Difficulty explaining how one attachment orientation leads to multiple disorders.
* **Divergent trajectories**: Why individuals with similar attachment vulnerabilities develop different sets of symptoms.

**Classification of Psychological Disorders**

Ein-Dor and Doron classified psychological disorders as either internalizing or externalizing:

* **Internalizing disorders**: Anxiety disorders, PTSD, depression, etc. - characterized by fear, distress, or depression.
* **Externalizing disorders**: Substance abuse, impulsivity, aggression, etc. - observable phenomena.

**Attachment Problems as Distal Risk Factors**

Problems with attachment are considered distal risk factors for psychopathology:

1. **Anxious attachment**:
   * **Maladaptive emotion-regulation processes**: Up-regulate negative affectivity.
   * Greater vigilance to threat-related cues and heightened empathic accuracy.
   * Lower level of perceived others' responsiveness.
2. **Avoidant attachment**:
   * **Maladaptive emotion-regulation processes**: Down-regulate affectivity and employ distancing strategies.
   * Compulsive self-reliance.
   * Lower levels of social support and perceived others' responsiveness.

**Proximal Risk Factors and Moderators**

Specific moderating factors interact with the proximal risk factors to contribute to psychopathology:

1. Living in an environment with a chronically mild to moderate level of threat.
2. Experience of significant loss.
3. Traumatic experiences.
4. Modeling, observational learning, and reinforcement that increase the likelihood of conduct problems.

**Attachment-Psychopathology Connection**

Mikulincer and Shaver (2007, 2012) addressed three questions regarding the attachment-psychopathology connection:

1. Specific type of attachment insecurity links to a specific type of psychopathology?
2. Is attachment pathology solely responsible for psychopathology?
3. Unidirectional or bidirectional link between attachment and psychopathology?

Their conclusions:

* Beyond disorders like separation anxiety and pathological grief, attachment insecurities are unlikely to be the sole cause of mental disorders.
* Other factors, such as genetically determined temperament and life history, also contribute to psychopathology.

**Serious Mental Disorders and Attachment Insecurities**

- Serious mental disorders result from multiple converging processes
- Attachment insecurities act as catalysts for other pathogenic processes by reducing psychological and social resources, weakening resilience
- Attachment insecurities can contribute to psychological disorders, but mental afflictions can also exacerbate attachment insecurity and lead to more severe attachment-system dysfunctions

**Self-Report vs. Interview Assessment of Attachment**

**Self-Report Measures**:
- First measure of adult romantic attachment by Hazen and Shaver (1987)
- Reveals little about unconscious influences contributing to attachment patterns
- Categorical and forced-choice nature, does not acknowledge individual differences within a category
- Limited test/retest stability (70%) due to measurement error, not true changes in attachment security over time

**Internalized Working Models**:
- Internalized set of assumptions regarding self and self-in-relation-to-others
- Self-report measures subject to response bias and represent conscious perception, not underlying representations

**Interview-Based Assessment (Adult Attachment Interview - **AAI)**:

- Accesses adult's unconscious processes pertaining to emotional regulation
- Identifies specific attachment style by coding forms of narrative interaction with prompts
- Surprising the unconscious, limited self-report measure gives opportunity for defense mechanisms
- More detailed subclassification of attachment style essential for complex cases or treatment-resistant patients
- Five-way classification system for precise determination of attachment patterns

**AAI vs. Self-Report Measures**:

- Little overlap between AAI and self-report measures of attachment
- Differences in what and how interview and self-report instruments measure
- Roisman et al. (2007) conducted a meta-analysis, found trivial to small overlap between AAI attachment status and self-reported attachment style
- Eagle (2013) noted the lack of convergence between AAI and self-report measures

**Chapter Overview**:

This chapter explores the empirical associations between disturbed attachment classification and risk for certain types of psychopathology. It reviews findings from both self-report and interview-based assessment methods, providing integrative commentary on the connection between attachment status and specific forms of psychopathology.

### ATTACHMENT, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, AND PSYCHIATRIC DISTRESS

Mikulincer and Shaver (2007) conducted two reviews on the correlation between attachment styles and neuroticism or psychiatric distress:

1. **Correlation between Attachment and Neuroticism**:
   - Reviewed approximately 30 studies of nonclinical populations.
   - Measured attachment using self-report scales like Adult Attachment Scale and Experiences in Close Relationships scale.
   - Measured neuroticism using Five Factor Personality Questionnaire.
   - All studies found significant correlations between attachment anxiety and neuroticism.
   - Previously learned attachment strategies continue to influence individuals' emotional experiences.

2. **Correlation between Attachment Orientation and Psychiatric Symptoms/Negative Affectivity**:
   - Reviewed 61 studies that measured different aspects of attachment, such as sense of security with peers and parents using Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA) and Parental Attachment Questionnaire (PAQ), and self-report measures of security and attachment style using Adult Attachment Scale.
   - Measured psychiatric symptomatology using various instruments, including Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID) interviews and self-report measures like Brief Symptom Inventory and Symptom Checklist–90.
   - Secure attachment to parents associated with lower levels of negative affectivity and less severe psychiatric symptomatology.
   - Overwhelming number of studies found significant correlations between anxious form of attachment insecurity and psychiatric symptoms/negative affectivity.
   - Fewer studies found such correlations with the avoidant style.

### ATTACHMENT AND ANXIETY DISORDERS 

* Ein-Dor and Doron (2015) reviewed research on attachment and anxiety disorders, finding a correlation between anxious and preoccupied states with more significant symptoms of anxiety.
* Insecure attachment as measured by the ECR was linked to elevated levels of OCD-related thinking style and symptoms, with attachment anxiety having a stronger relationship than avoidance.
* Mikulincer and Shaver (2007) found that secure attachment experiences reduced fear responses in spider phobics, while insecure attachment increased fear.
* Anxiety-related disorders are considered internalizing disorders, as they involve maximizing the expression of attachment needs.
* Bowlby suggested all anxiety disorders stem from proximity and availability issues with the primary attachment figure.
* Sroufe et al. (2005) found a link between anxious/resistant attachment in infancy and anxiety disorders later in life due to insecure internal working models of relationships.
* E. K. Adam, Gunnar, and Tanaka (2004) discovered that a mother's observed parenting behaviors and self-reported emotional wellbeing correlated with adult attachment classifications using the AAI.
* Preoccupied mothers reported higher levels of negative affect and anxiety and demonstrated angry and intrusive parenting behaviors.

**Attachment Styles and Anxiety**

* **Anxious/Preoccupied**: Correlates with more significant symptoms of anxiety, as found in both self-report measures and the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI).
* **Avoidant**: A less clear association is found between avoidant attachment style and anxiety symptoms, with approximately 50% of studies reporting a significant association.
* **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**: Insecure attachment as measured by the ECR is related to elevated levels of OCD-related thinking style and symptoms.

**Experimental Studies on Attachment and Fear**

* Mikulincer and Shaver (2007) found that secure attachment experiences reduced fear responses in spider phobics, while insecure attachment increased fear.

**Theoretical Perspectives**

* **Bowlby**: All anxiety disorders are related to proximity and availability issues with the primary attachment figure.
* **Sroufe and Fleeson (1986)**: The infant-caregiver attachment relationship is the foundation of personality development.

**Longitudinal Studies on Attachment and Anxiety**

* **Sroufe et al. (2005)**: Secure attachment supports emotion regulation and exploration, while insecure attachment in infancy is associated with anxiety symptoms in adolescence due to insecure internal working models of relationships.
* **Bosquet and Egeland (2006)**: Insecure attachment in infants was associated with anxiety symptoms throughout childhood and adolescence.

**Mother's Attachment Classifications and Parenting Behaviors**

* **E. K. Adam, Gunnar, and Tanaka (2004)**: Mothers' observed parenting behaviors and self-reported emotional wellbeing correlated with adult attachment classifications using the AAI.
* Preoccupied mothers reported higher levels of negative affect and anxiety and demonstrated angry and intrusive parenting behaviors.

**Study by Manassis et al. (1994): Anxious Mothers and Their Insecurely Attached Children**

- Conducted a study on mothers with anxiety disorders using the Attachment Interview (AAI) and Structured Clinical Interview (SCID)
- **18 outpatient women diagnosed with anxiety disorders**: 14 panic disorder, 3 generalized anxiety disorder, 1 OCD
- **14 of the mothers were unresolved (Ud) with respect to trauma or loss**: 6 loss, 2 trauma, 6 both
- 85% of children were insecurely attached and 65% disorganized
- High level of insecure attachment in children led to the importance of addressing potential issues in parent-child relationships
- Helping anxious adults resolve past experiences may indirectly benefit their children

**Study by Fonagy et al. (1996): Anxiety Disorders and Unresolved Attachment Classification (Ud)**

- Studied 82 nonpsychotic inpatients and 85 controls using the AAI four-way classification system
- Significantly more inpatients received an unresolved classification (Ud) indicating disorganization related to loss or trauma
- Correlation between anxiety disorder diagnosis and Ud classification
- Anxiety may be a result of past experiences invading the present, but causality is unclear

**Study by Ivarsson et al. (2008): Attachment Classifications among Adolescents with OCD**

- **Interviewed 100 adolescents**: 25 each with OCD, depressive disorder (DD), and both OCD and DD, and general population controls
- AAI used to assess attachment classification using the five-way classification system
- **Classification differed significantly across groups**: OCD - dismissing (60%); DD - unresolved (28%) or cannot classify (CC) (24%); both disorders - dismissing (52%) or unresolved (32%)
- Attachment disturbances could contribute to the development and reinforcement of OCD symptoms
- Longitudinal study needed to correlate attachment classification and children at high risk for developing OCD

**Panic Disorders and Attachment Classifications**

- Panic disorders characterized by sudden onset and symptoms like shortness of breath, heart palpitations, chest pain
- Little research on correlation between attachment classifications and panic disorder
- **Zeijlmans van Emmichoven et al. (2003) study**: 28 outpatients with panic disorder with agoraphobia, majority had dismissing attachment (43%)

**Proposed Solution: Ideal Parent Figure Protocol**

- Reshaping internal working models to lessen suffering for patients with anxiety disorders
- Ideal Parent Figure protocol described in detail in Chapter 8 of the book
- Creating new, fresh, and positive attachment representations

### Attachment and Affective Disorders 

**Affective Disorders and Suicidality**

- Mikulincer and Shaver (2007) reviewed over 100 studies on attachment quality in adulthood and depressive symptoms.
- Secure attachment was linked to lower levels of depression.
- Anxious attachment (anxious-preoccupied or high attachment anxiety on self-report measures) was associated with elevated levels of anxiety and depression compared to securely attached individuals.
- About 50% of avoidant subjects showed elevated levels of anxiety and depression.

**Studies on Depressive Symptoms and Attachment Dispositions**

- More than 100 studies have examined the relationship between attachment dispositions and depressive symptoms (Ein-Dor & Doron, 2015).
- Individuals with dismissing or preoccupied classifications on the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) and those with self-reported attachment avoidance or anxiety showed more depressive symptoms.

**Longitudinal Study: Mothers' Attachment Style, Mental Health, and Marital Satisfaction**

- Berant, Mikulincer, and Shaver (2008) conducted a seven-year prospective longitudinal study of 63 mothers with children born with congenital heart disease.
- The mother's attachment anxiety level did not contribute significantly to changes in mental health by Time 3.
- Mothers with avoidant attachment at the time of their child's diagnosis had more symptoms than expected at T3.
- Women with a higher level of avoidant attachment and infants with severe CHD showed the most difficulty.
- **The mother's attachment status was related to children's later self-concept**: the higher the mother's avoidance or anxiety score, the less positive her child's explicit self-concept 7 years later.
- Interaction between attachment anxiety and severity of CHD predisposed children who suffered from severe CHD to develop a less positive explicit self-concept.

**Relationship Between Attachment Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms in Specific Populations**

- Kobak, Sudler, and Gamble (1991) found that adolescents with insecure attachment, particularly anxious-preoccupied attachment, were related to higher levels of depressive symptoms.
- Depressed teens perceived higher levels of maternal dominance and expressed higher levels of dysfunctional anger during problem-solving episodes.
- Cole-Detke and Kobak (1996) found that women with primarily hyperactivating attachment strategies had significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms than those with deactivating, dismissing strategies.

**Attachment Styles in Specific Disorders**

- Patrick, Hobson, Castle, Howard, and Maughan (1994) studied 24 patients with borderline personality disorder and 8 patients with dysthymic disorder.
- Dysthymic patients had a significant representation of preoccupied attachment and unresolved status with respect to trauma compared to borderlines.
- Fonagy et al. (1996) studied 82 nonpsychotic psychiatric inpatients and matched healthy control subjects.
- Patients with major depressive disorder were significantly more likely to be secure than either bipolar or dysthymic patients.
- Scores on the AAI Anger scale were higher for the MDD group than for the bipolar and dysthymic groups.

**Attachment and Suicidality**

- DeJong (1992) compared two groups of undergraduates, one with and one without a history of suicidality.
- The group with a history of suicidality had less secure attachment to their parents as measured by the IPPA.
- K. S. Adam, Sheldon-Keller, and West (1996) gave the AAI to 132 inpatient psychiatric adolescents with and without a history of suicidal ideation.
- Both preoccupied attachment and unresolved status were significantly associated with suicidal ideation, while dismissing attachment meant low suicidal ideation.

**Link Between Early Attachment Relationships and Psychopathology**

- Riggs and Jacobvitz (2002) gave the AAI to 233 expectant mothers and fathers with a history of child abuse.
- Fifty percent of the sample had a secure attachment classification, 22% had a dismissing classification, 6% had a preoccupied classification, and 22% were classified as unresolved.
- Unresolved adults were considerably more likely to report emotional distress and suicidal ideation, dismissing adults were more likely to report criminal charges, and preoccupied adults were more likely to report suicidal ideation than either secure or dismissing adults.
- Preoccupied individuals reported a significantly higher likelihood of suicidal ideation than those with other attachment classifications.
- Dismissing women had significantly lower levels of depression.
- Subjects with unresolved status for trauma or loss reported greater suicidal ideation, emotional distress, and substance abuse than those with resolved status.

### ATTACHMENT AND BIPOLAR DISORDER

**Attachment and Bipolar Disorder**

- Berry, Barrowclough, and Wearden (2007) reviewed studies on attachment status in patients with psychosis, including bipolar disorder.
  - Higher levels of insecure attachment, specifically dismissing attachment, in samples with psychosis compared to controls.
  - Schizophrenia patients had higher levels of insecurity than those with affective diagnoses, such as bipolar disorder and major depression.

**Studies on Attachment and Bipolar Disorder**

- Dozier (1990) gave the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) to 42 psychotic patients, 25 of whom were diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
  - Patients with bipolar psychosis had less secure attachment than schizophrenics using the Q-sort method.
- Dozier et al. (1991) assessed AAI transcripts on 21 schizophrenics, 11 bipolar patients, and 8 major depressive disorder patients.
  - Dismissing attachment was associated with an externalizing/outward focus in bipolar patients.
  - Psychotic patients with hyperactivating strategies reported greater symptom severity, but psychotic patients with dismissing strategies had more symptoms.
- **Fonagy et al. (1996) studied patients with bipolar disorder and found**:
  - Higher prevalence of Ds classification in bipolar patients (38%) compared to MMD (7%) or dysthymic patients (14%).
  - Narratives of bipolar patients were characterized by derogation associated with a hypomanic or manic state and readily classified as Ds.

**Findings from the Orphanage Study**

- In an orphanage study, 14 of 45 subjects had a type II bipolar disorder diagnosis.
- No bipolar type I or psychotic bipolar subjects were in the sample.
- Bipolar type II subjects were significantly more likely to have insecure than secure attachment on the AAI.
- Most AAIs were scored as disorganized (CC).
- An overrepresentation of disorganization (CC) was found in bipolar type II subjects instead of the Ds classification, which was commonly identified in previous studies using the AAI.

### SOMATIC SYMPTOM DISORDERS

- Waldinger, Schulz, Barsky, and Ahern (2006) investigated the role of insecure attachment in adult somatization.
- The study included couples with abuse histories and recent violence perpetrated by the male.
- Participants completed the Somatic Symptom Inventory (SSI), Relationship Scales Questionnaire (RSQ), and reported childhood trauma.

**Findings**:

* 56% of women and 17% of men reported sexual abuse histories.
* Women reported more emotional abuse (51% versus 36%) and significantly more trauma than men (p. 131).
* **Childhood trauma influenced adult levels of somatization for both women and men, but differently**:
  * **For women**: insecure attachment fostered somatization.
  * **For men**: trauma and attachment were independent predictors.

**Assessing Attachment**:

- Maunder and Hunter (2009) argued assessing attachment style is important for medical patients.
- Ciechanowski et al. (2002) found attachment style related to symptom reporting and healthcare utilization in female primary care patients.
- Waller et al. (2004) used the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) to investigate attachment representations in somatoform disorders.

**Attachment and Somatoform Disorders**:

* **Somatoform disorders**: multiple unexplained physical symptoms without demonstrable pathophysiological processes.
* Waller et al. (2004) aimed to apply attachment theory to somatoform disorders.
- Significantly more somatoform patients than controls were classified as insecure on the AAI.
  * **Insecure dismissing**: less frequent physician visits, greater number of hospital admissions.
  * **Insecure preoccupied**: more physician visits, fewer hospitalizations.
- Somatization correlated positively with dismissing attachment.

**Additional Studies**:

* Neumann et al. (2011) found all somatoform pain patients had insecure attachment.
  * Lower parental loving scores and higher rejection scores on the AAI parenting scales.
  * Higher angry preoccupation on state-of-mind scales.
* Pajuhinia and Faraji (2014) found both dismissing and preoccupied insecure attachment were positively correlated with vulnerability to somatization.
* Scheidt et al. (1999) found dismissing attachment was more prevalent in patients with idiopathic spasmodic torticollis and alexithymia.
- Kozlowska and Williams (2009) studied attachment in children with conversion disorder using the Dynamic-Maturational Model assessment system.
  * **Inhibitory attachment strategy**: related to negative CD symptoms.
  * **Excitatory attachment strategy**: related to positive CD symptoms.

**Fibromyalgia**:

* Waller et al. (2015) found unusually high unresolved status with respect to trauma in fibromyalgia patients.

### FACTITIOUS DISORDERS

- Originally emerged from a paper titled "Hysteria Split Asunder" published in 1978 before DSM-III
- Replaced over-inclusive and diagnostically imprecise concept of hysteria in DSM-II
- **Split into four categories**: 
  - histrionic personality disorder
  - somatoform disorders
  - dissociative disorders
  - factitious disorders
- **Factitious Disorders** defined as "artificial production or simulation of a disease [or history]" (Folks & Freeman, 1985)

**Characteristics of Factitious Disorders**

- Involve deliberate deception and intentional self-harm
- Symptoms are dramatically presented and exaggerated when observed
- **Three essential clinical features**: 
  - pathological lying
  - recurrent simulated illnesses
  - assuming sick role for attention or caretaking
- Compulsive need to assume a sick role to receive care differentiates factitious illness from other self-destructive behaviors

**Motivations and Developmental Disturbances**

- Arises from developmental disturbance and attachment issues
- Early childhood deprivation, difficult relationships with parents, and traumatic early illness or hospitalization may contribute to factitious behavior
- Abnormal illness behavior as an attempt to cope with early object losses in a narcissistic manner
- Arrested self and self-esteem development is a primary feature
- Insecure attachment and unresolved status with respect to trauma and loss are likely important in the development of factitious behavior

**Relationships with Caregivers**

- Reenactment of past developmental disturbances
- Earliest psychoanalytic descriptions emphasized pre-oedipal deprivation
- Abnormal illness behavior arises from fundamental problems in attachment, bonding, and caretaking

**Comorbidity with Personality Disorders**

- 83% of factitious patients had significant evidence for "disorders of self-regulation" (Ehlers & Plassmann, 1994)
- 50% of factitious patients had coexisting borderline personality disorder and another 25% had narcissistic personality disorder

**Long-term Consequences**

- Unstable, protean sense of self and vulnerability to self-fragmentation
- Failure in self-development may explain why factitious patients can easily assume different identities and personal histories over time
- Some experts view factitious behavior as an adaptive attempt to prevent total fragmentation of an unstable sense of self by asserting and reinforcing false identities.

### MALINGERING

**Study by Pianta, Egeland, and Adam (1996): Attachment and Validity Scales on MMPI-2**

* **Main purpose**: Examine relationship between self-reported psychiatric symptoms on MMPI-2 and attachment status
* Valuable data emerged about attachment's relation to validity scales

**Attachment and Psychiatric Distress**

* **Dismissing attachment**: Reported little psychiatric distress (Q-sort method)
* **Preoccupied attachment**: Highest on range of indices of psychiatric symptoms

**Attachment and Validity Scales on MMPI-2**

* **Dismissing attachment**: Associated with minimization, "fake" good profile
* **Preoccupied attachment**: Associated with exaggeration, "fake" bad profile
* All invalid profiles had insecure attachment (mostly preoccupied)
* **Preoccupied attachment**: Significantly more likely to score in elevated range on Response Infrequency (F) scale

**MMPI-2 Profiles and Dissociative Coping with Trauma**

* Significant elevations on F and Sc scales common for subjects with dissociative coping
* Careful assessment of raw and T scores necessary
* Disorganized (CC) status more representative of significant elevations on F and Sc than preoccupied status

**Malingering Probability Scale (MPS) and Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms (SIRS) in Orphanage Study**

* Insecure attachment and low coherence of mind significantly related to increased probability of exaggerating or fabricating psychiatric symptoms
* Factitious individuals and malingering patients often have insecure attachment and histories of chronic illnesses in childhood
* Attachment needs partially satisfied by medical caretakers, leading to compulsive production of symptoms for attention

**Limitations**

* Pianta et al. (1996) did not use five-way classification, potentially limiting understanding of attachment strategies

### Trauma-Related Disorders

* **Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**

**Pielage, Gerlsma, and Schaap (2000) Study**:

* Investigated relationships between stressful events, attachment style, and psychopathology
* **Used Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) to measure attachment styles**: Secure, Preoccupied, Dismissing, Fearful
* **Results**:
  * Secure attachment negatively correlated with amount of experienced stressful events (-0.22) and psychological symptoms (-0.21)
  * Fearful attachment positively correlated with degree of stressful events (0.40) and psychological symptoms (0.30)
* **Conclusion**: Fearful individuals' chronic sense of insecurity increases their vulnerability to experience psychological symptoms due to their perception and interpretation of events as stressful
* **Caveat**: Insecure attachment may also be a result of psychological symptoms

**Alexander (1993) Study**:

* Investigated attachment status of women who were victims of incest during childhood
* **Results: Significantly different endorsement of attachment styles from normative group**: 58% fearful versus 21% in the normative group
* **Conclusion**: Women with a history of sexual abuse had an elevated level of attachment anxiety while maintaining confidence in their partners' dependability

**Whiffen, Judd, and Aube (1999) Study**:

* Investigated whether the link between childhood sexual abuse and depression in women was moderated by adult attachment to romantic partners
* **Results**: No correlation between depressive symptoms and a history of sexual abuse; women with more severe abuse history had an elevated level of attachment anxiety while maintaining confidence in their partners' dependability

**Ein-Dor, Doron, Solomon, Mikulincer, and Shaver (2010) Study**:

* Investigated the relationship between adult attachment style and PTSD and secondary traumatic stress (STS) in veterans and their wives
* **Results**: Higher attachment anxiety in veterans and their wives was correlated with severity of PTSD and STS, respectively; avoidant status only associated with PTSD and STS in couples with a former captive soldier

**Fraley, Fazzare, Bonanno, and Dekel (2006) Study**:

* Investigated the relationship between adult attachment style and psychological adaptation in adults present at the World Trade Center terrorist attacks on 9/11
* **Results**: Insecure attachment not related to initial level or changes in PTSD or depression symptoms; secure individuals exhibited relatively modest initial levels of PTSD symptoms that decreased over time, and their depression levels were indistinguishable from normative mean

**Wallis and Steele (2001) Study**:

* Administered Adult Attachment Interview to 39 adolescents hospitalized on psychiatric units
* All participants had experienced childhood loss or abuse

**Study Findings on Attachment and Trauma in Adolescents and Adults**

**Overview**: The studies examined the prevalence of unresolved status with respect to trauma or loss, different types of attachment classifications, and their impact on infant attachment.

**Adolescent Sample**: In a residential adolescent clinical sample, F (Female) = 10%, Ds (Dismissing) = 51%, E (Anxious-Preoccupied) = 28%, CC (Cautious-Controlling) = 10%, and Ud (Unresolved) = 59% reported unresolved status with respect to trauma or loss. The most common shared feature was the high level of loss and trauma in their childhood histories.

**Women's Sample**: Stovall-McClough, Cloitre, and McClough (2008) interviewed women aged 18-65 with severe emotional, physical, and sexual abuse histories. The sample consisted of:

- **Unresolved (Ud) regarding loss and/or abuse**: Slightly over 50%
- **Unresolved only regarding abuse**: Not specified
- **Anxious-Preoccupied (E)**:
  - **Passively preoccupied (E1)**: 19%
  - **Angrily preoccupied (E2)**: 38%
  - **Fearfully preoccupied (E3)**: 43%
- **Dismissive (Ds)**: 12%
  - **Idealizing type (Ds)**: Not found
  - **Derogating type (Ds2)**: 21%
  - **Cognitively aware/emotionally restricted type (Ds3)**: 79%

**Mother-Infant Dyads**: Schuengel, Bakermans-Kranenburg, and van IJzendoorn (1999) examined 85 nonclinical mother–infant dyads to test Main and Hesse's hypothesis that the presence of frightening behaviors exhibited by parents with unresolved loss is linked to disorganized infant attachment.

- Participants experienced trauma connected exclusively to the loss of a significant attachment relationship.
- Mothers were assessed for attachment classifications using the AAI when infants were 12 months old, and infant attachment organizations were determined using the Strange Situation Procedure (SS) when infants were approximately 15 months old.
- **Of the 85 mothers**:
  - **Unresolved loss**: 20
  - **Not unresolved loss**: 65
- **Infants classified as disorganized according to their SS behavior**: 26
- Mothers with unresolved loss and an insecure representation of attachment had the highest scores for frightening behavior. Conversely, mothers with unresolved loss and a secure representation of attachment had very low scores for frightening behavior. Frightening caregiver behavior forecasted disorganized infant attachment.

**Adult Attachment Studies**: From their review of over 200 studies including over 10,000 AAI administrations, Bakermans-Kranenburg and van IJzendoorn (2009) found that adults with abuse experiences or PTSD were mostly unresolved.

**Insecure Attachment and Childhood Sexual Abuse**: Stalker and Davies (1995) found that insecure attachment status, notably preoccupied attachment, predicts which survivors of childhood sexual abuse are more likely to have unresolved status with respect to the abuse.

**Conclusion**: The intergenerational nature of attachment-related trauma necessitates clinical importance to provide treatment addressing both the individual's traumatic experiences and symptomology as well as decreasing caregivers' frightened/frightening behaviors and increasing sensitivity and attunement-focused behaviors.

### ATTACHMENT AND DISSOCIATIVE DISORDERS

* Nilsson, Holmqvist, and Jonson (2011) studied the relationship between attachment style and dissociative symptoms.
* Used a modified version of the Experiences in Close Relationships scale (ECR).
* **Two dimensions of attachment**: avoidance and anxiety.
* **Modifications**: subjects endorsed items based on closest relationship and were asked about whom they were thinking about when answering.

**Findings from Nilsson et al. (2011) study**:

* Self-reported attachment style correlated substantially with dissociation.
* Anxious attachment style more prevalent in group with more trauma and reported dissociative symptoms.
* Secure attachment might protect against dissociation.

**Coe et al. (1995) study**:

* **Measured four types of dissociative experience**: memory disturbance, absorption, isolation, and fragmentation.
* Insecure attachment linked to increased levels of dissociation and exposure to violence in childhood.
* Secure attachment showed fewer dissociative symptoms and lower reports of childhood violence.

**Additional findings from Coe et al. (1995) study**:

* Fearful attachment style related to memory disturbance, violence in childhood, depersonalization, and derealization.
* Preoccupied attachment style significantly correlated with absorption.
* Dismissing attachment style showed only modest degree of dissociative isolation but infrequent reporting of dissociative absorption predicted dismissing attachment style.

**Overall**:

* Attachment style and dissociative symptoms are related.
* Insecure attachment linked to increased levels of dissociation and exposure to violence in childhood.
* Secure attachment might protect against dissociation.
* Specific types of attachment styles relate to specific types of dissociation.

### DEPERSONALIZATION/DEREALIZATION DISORDER (DRD)

- Previously known as Depersonalization Disorder (DPD) before DSM-IV
- Defined by persistent or recurrent episodes of depersonalization, derealization, or both

**Depersonalization**:

- Alteration in perception or experience of self
- Feeling detached from mental processes or body
- **Characterized by**:
  - Vigilant alertness
  - Profound inhibition of emotional feelings
  - Diminished autonomic response to emotional stimuli
  - Blunted pain response

**Derealization**:
- Alteration in perception or experience of the world and surroundings
- Feeling as if in a fog or dream

**Research on DPD**:
- Prior studies demonstrated that DPD is a distinct disorder
- Can be differentiated from other dissociative disorders and psychiatric conditions (Simeon et al., 1997)

**Symptom Categories of DPD**:
- Emotional numbing
- Disembodiment
- Anomalous subjective recall and disruption of self-experience
- Derealization (Sierra and David, 2011)

**Orphanage Study**:

- 12 adults identified with clinically significant depersonalization
- 7 adults identified with clinically significant derealization
- Significant association between insecure (mostly disorganized) attachment and depersonalization (p < 0.05) and derealization (p < 0.01)
- Secure attachment status protected children from developing depersonalization or derealization in adulthood.

### DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER (DID)
* Defined by the existence of two or more alter personality states (APS) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)
* Loss of executive control when an APS manifests over the host personality
* Amnesia for some experiences/behaviors of APS
* Associated clinical features include dissociative amnesia and depersonalization
* 105 somatoform symptoms are highly comorbid with DID (Nijenhuis, van der Hart, & Steele, 2002)

**Personality Functioning in DID Patients**

* Broadly classified into an apparently normal personality structure (ANP) and emotional personality (EP) states
* ANP focuses on everyday functioning at the expense of emotional processing
* EP states concerned with remembering and processing stressful emotional and traumatic experiences

**Attachment Interviews of DID Patients**

* Steele (2003) studied five female survivors of chronic ritual abuse with suspected DID using Adult Attachment Interviews (AAI)
* All women had unresolved status (Ud) with respect to trauma or loss and "cannot classify" (CC) as the primary attachment classification
* Deeply divided states of mind concerning attachment
* Same interview may qualify for multiple incompatible attachment orientations

**Attachment and Alter Personality States**

* Each alter personality state is an expression of a specific unmet attachment need
* Switches from one APS to another as sequential manifestations of these unmet attachment needs

**Dissociative Disorders Study**

* 3 of 45 subjects in orphanage study met full diagnostic criteria for DID, 17 met partial criteria (dissociative disorder not otherwise specified - DDNOS)
* Trend towards insecure (mostly disorganized) attachment associated with DID/DDNOS distinct "parts" diagnosis
* Low coherence of transcript and low coherence of mind significantly correlated with a diagnosis of DID/DDNOS

**Farina et al. Study**

* 13 patients with various dissociative disorders (including DID and DDNOS) and 13 healthy matched control subjects given AAI
* Healthy attachment has an organizing effect on states of mind, including brain EEG coherence, which is lacking in patients with clinically significant dissociative disorders
* 8 of 13 subjects were classified as CC using the five-way AAI classification system, but only 1 met full diagnostic criteria for DID

**Minnesota Longitudinal Study**

* Gold standard study assessing effects of childhood neglect and abuse on psychopathology in adulthood
* Disorganized attachment aggravated by later childhood abuse predicts the development of dissociative disorders in adulthood
* Children with disorganized attachment at 12 and 18 months from Strange Situation assessment showed a wide range of dissociative experiences throughout childhood and adolescence, which tended to decline during early adulthood
* If a disorganized attached child was physically and/or sexually abused in later childhood, the older child tended to primarily use a dissociative coping style to deal with abuse, leading to pathological, structural dissociation characterized by rigid compartmentalization

**Liotti's Three-Pathway Model**

* Exposure of the child to extreme frightened/frightening parental behavior during early childhood results in disorganized attachment and mild dissociative symptoms throughout childhood and adolescence
* Exposure of the child to frightened/frightening parental behavior in early childhood followed by subsequent physical and/or sexual abuse in later childhood results in DID in adulthood
* Limited exposure to frightened/frightening parental behavior or exposure offset by other healthy caregivers results in high normal but not pathological dissociative experiences in adulthood.

### Attachment and Addictions

**Substance Abuse**
- Continued use despite negative impact on cognitive, behavioral, and physiological systems
- Creates extreme stimulation of brain reward system, leading to dependency
- Dependency involves increased tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, and compulsive use

**Study by Kassel, Wardle, and Roberts (2007)**
- Measured attachment using an 18-item Likert-style inventory
- Found significant relationship between insecure attachment (anxious type) and substance use
- Anxious attachment linked to higher frequency of substance use and stress-motivated use
- No association found between attachment and alcohol or marijuana use for non-stress related reasons

**Study by Allen, Hauser, and Borman-Spurrell (1996)**
- Insecure attachment linked to increased incidents of hard drug use in later adolescence
- Dismissing states of mind, unresolved status with respect to trauma, and high derogation of attachment significantly related to higher drug use

**Study by Riggs and Jacobvitz (2002)**
- Unresolved status with respect to trauma linked to alcohol or drug abuse
- Unresolved status with respect to loss linked to criminal behavior

**Study by Rosenstein and Horowitz (1996)**
- Dismissing attachment linked to conduct disorders and adolescent substance abuse
- Preoccupied attachment linked to affective disorders

**Study by Simonelli and Vizziello (2002)**
- Majority of drug-addicted mothers had anxious-preoccupied or unresolved attachment
- Most children of these mothers were insecurely attached

**Study by Barone, Borelli, Madeddu, and Maffei (2000)**
- Overrepresentation of insecure, largely dismissing attachment in alcoholics and drug abusers
- Dismissing/derogating attachment overrepresented in borderline personality disorder with substance abuse/dependency and alcohol abuse/dependency

**Affect Dysregulation and Addictions**
- Drug addicts have problems with affect dysregulation and deficits in mentalizing

**Attachment-Oriented Treatment of Addictions**
- Aimed at developing healthy internal working models for attachment and associated healthy forms of affect regulation
- Substance abuse seen as attempt to temper internal conflict or overpowering emotions, defense against processing traumatic childhood events

**Clinical Implications**
- Consideration of early attachment relationships and current attachment patterns important in treating patients with addictions and substance abuse disorders.

### EATING DISORDERS

**Eating Disorders and Attachment**

The following summarizes the key findings from various studies investigating the relationship between eating disorders (EDs) and attachment styles.

**Illing et al. (2010)**
- Women with ED diagnoses showed higher levels of insecure attachment than a control group.
- Anorexia nervosa, bingeing type, was associated with the highest levels of anxious and avoidant attachment.
- Higher degrees of attachment anxiety, specifically on the Need for Approval scale, were linked to more severe ED symptoms before treatment.
- Women with the highest levels of attachment anxiety had the poorest treatment outcomes.

**Shanmugam et al. (2012)**
- A positive association was found between disordered eating and both anxious and avoidant attachment styles in young adult college and sports club athletes.
- Self-esteem, depression, and self-critical perfectionism mediated the link between attachment styles and elevated eating psychopathology.

**Cole-Detke and Kobak (1996)**
- Dismissing attachment was more common in women with high eating disorder symptoms than other attachment groups when depression levels were controlled.
- Women with both eating disorder symptoms and depression were predominantly anxious-preoccupied.

**Fonagy et al. (1996)**
- Dismissing attachment, high idealization of parents, and low reflective functioning were associated with eating disorders in nonpsychotic inpatients.
- The relationship between a diagnosis of eating disorder and idealization of parents echoes the clinical observation that individuals with eating disorders are perfectionists.

**Ward et al. (2001)**
- Nineteen out of nineteen anorexic patients and ten out of twelve mothers were classified as insecure on the AAI.
- Reflective functioning scores were very low for both anorexics and their mothers.

**Zachrisson and Kulbotten (2006)**
- Insecure attachment and unresolved status with respect to trauma were overrepresented in anorexic women.
- All 20 anorexic women were insecure with either dismissing, preoccupied, or disorganized attachment.
- Anxiety levels were significantly higher in anorexics with dismissing attachment.

**Barone and Guiducci (2009)**
- The majority of ED patients had insecure attachment, mostly of the dismissing type.
- ED patients had significantly greater parental rejection, involving, and neglect on the AAI parenting scales.
- ED patients had a significantly higher lack of recall regarding attachment experiences and significantly lower coherence of transcript and coherence of mind.
- Unresolved status with respect to trauma was overrepresented in bulimic and binge ED groups but not anorexic groups.

**Schwartz and Rechtien (personal communication, July 2015)**
- Most severe ED patients were given the cannot classify (CC) attachment classification from the five-way AAI classification system and an A/C classification from the DMM scoring system.
- Using the AAI to set treatment goals led to a movement towards earned security of attachment, accompanied by a decrease in eating disorder behaviors.

### Attachment and Personality Disorders

**Personality Disorders in General**

- Meyer and Pilkonis (2005) studied the relationship between attachment styles and personality disorders using the Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR) questionnaire.
  - **Attachment Anxiety**: correlated with avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, schizotypal, histrionic, narcissistic, and borderline personality disorders.
    * Strongest correlations for borderline and dependent personality disorders.
  - No relationship found between attachment anxiety and schizoid personality.
  - **Attachment Avoidance**: correlated with avoidant, paranoid, and schizoid personality disorders.
- **Organizing findings according to quadrants of attachment types**:
  * **Preoccupied quadrant**: histrionic, borderline, and dependent subjects
  * **Fearful (disorganized) quadrant**: avoidant types
  * **Dismissing quadrant**: only schizoid subjects
  * **Border between preoccupied and fearful attachment**: paranoid, obsessive-compulsive, narcissistic, and schizotypal subjects

**Differentiating Narcissistic Personality into Two Subtypes (Dickinson & Pincus, 2003)**

- **Adult Attachment Questionnaire (AAQ) used to classify attachment styles**: secure, preoccupied, dismissing, or fearful.
- **Correlations found between group classification and endorsed attachment style**:
  * **Grandiose narcissism**: 60% secure, 16% dismissive, 13% fearful, 10% preoccupied.
  * **Vulnerable narcissism**: 50% fearful, 27% secure, 13% preoccupied, 10% dismissive.
  * **Control group**: 53% secure, 23% fearful, 17% preoccupied, 7% dismissive.

**Attachment Status and Personality Functioning (Alexander, 1993)**

- Assessed attachment status using the self-report Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) and personality functioning with the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory II (MCMI-II).
- **Significant correlations between attachment status and presence of a personality disorder**:
  * **Fearful attachment**: most variance on MCMI-II Avoidance scale.
  * **Preoccupied and dismissing attachment**: most associated with Dependent scale.
  * **Fearful and preoccupied attachment**: significantly predicted scores on Masochistic/Self-Defeating scale.
  * **Preoccupied attachment**: most significantly associated with Borderline scale.
- Abuse characteristics not associated with basic personality structure but instead predicted by adult attachment.

### BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER
- Individuals with BPD exhibit devastating behavioral problems, including self-injurious behavior (69%-75% prevalence) and increased suicide risk (400 times greater than general population)
- Negatively impacts treatment efficacy for Axis I disorders
- Difficult to treat due to rapidly shifting attachment strategies and extreme ambivalence in forming attachments
- Affects 1%-3% of the population, but causes significant long-term impairment

**Study by Lyons-Ruth et al. (2007)**

- Examined women with BPD and dysthymia using Attachment Anxiety and Avoidance Inventory (AAI)
- **Hypothesis**: Lack of attuned parenting in early life leads to unintegrated idealized and denigrated representations of others
- Focus on disorganized attachment patterns

**Hostile-Helpless (HH) States of Mind**

- Assesses contradictory and malevolent ways of representing attachment figures
- **Examples**: global devaluation, identification with a hostile caregiver, sense of special unworthiness, fearful affect, laughter at pain, controlling or punitive behavior, ruptured attachment

**Findings**

- All women with BPD manifested hostile-helpless states of mind
- Fearfully preoccupied states (E3) associated with providing caregiving to the caregiver in early childhood and globally devaluing caregivers during interview
- Preoccupied (E) classifications more common in BPD patients than dysthymic patients
- Unresolved/disorganized (Ud) status more common in BPD group than dysthymic group
- **BPD patients had rare subtype of E category**: E3 (3% in low-risk populations)

**Study by Rosenstein and Horowitz (1996)**

- Identified quality of attachment in psychiatrically ill adolescents and their mothers
- Adolescents with borderline personality traits did not have preoccupied classification, but those diagnosed with BPD did
- Striking similarity between adolescents’ and mothers’ attachment classifications

**Study by Fonagy et al. (1996)**

- Studied patterns of attachment and psychiatric status using AAI four-way classification system and SCID-I and SCID-II
- Most specific and robust relationship between BPD and attachment classification

**Characteristics of BPD Patients**:
- Higher prevalence of abuse and neglect (89%) in their childhood.
- Lower ratings on Reflective Self-Function (RSF) scale.
- Significantly higher scores on Lack of Resolution of Abuse or Loss scales (89%).

**Impact of Childhood Trauma**: Individuals who experienced severe maltreatment in childhood may inhibit their mentalizing function to defend against the realization that their caregiver wished them harm. This defensive disruption becomes a core symptom in BPD, making it more difficult for these patients to work toward resolution of their traumatic stress.

**Attachment Styles**:
- **Preoccupied (E)**: 75% of BPD patients were preoccupied, with 47% being fearfully preoccupied (E3). There was also a significant association between anxiety disorders and the E3 subclassification.
- **Unresolved (U) and Entangled/Preoccupied (E) vs Secure/Autonomous (F)**: Barone found that unresolved and entangled/preoccupied status were overrepresented in BPD group, whereas secure/autonomous subjects constituted only a small percentage. Dismissing classifications were present in similar proportions in both groups.
- **Anger scores**: BPD subjects with F classifications were generally high in anger scores (F5), and those with Ds classifications had a trend toward angry derogation (Ds2) or high idealization (Ds1). BPD subjects with E classifications were mostly divided between an angry stance (E2) and a fearful overwhelmed stance (E3).
- **Loving experiences**: The clinical group described fewer loving experiences from both parents and more rejecting and neglecting experiences.
- **Role-reversing experience**: The clinical group scored significantly higher on having had a role-reversing experience with their mothers during childhood.
- **Metacognition and unresolved trauma**: The clinical group scored significantly lower on metacognition and significantly higher in terms of evidence of unresolved trauma.
- **Coherence of transcript and coherence of mind**: The clinical group scored dramatically lower on ratings of coherence of transcript and coherence of mind.

**Attachment Disorders**:
- Internalizing disorders, particularly BPD, were strongly overrepresented by preoccupied and unresolved attachment classifications.
- Externalizing disorders such as antisocial personality disorder were more associated with dismissing attachment as well as preoccupied attachment.

**Conclusion**: The findings from these studies suggest that the developmental factors placing a child at risk for developing BPD include an actively rejecting father and an unloving and neglecting mother, which may impair the security of BPD subjects and be associated with a failure in resolving traumatic experiences.

**Limitations of Levy's Findings**

- Most studies he reviewed did not use the five-way classification system for Attachment Styles (CC, Ds, F, E, U)
- Important to consider contradictory combinations of preoccupied (E) and dismissing elements (Ds) in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)
- Classification systems that do not allow for combination classifications may yield artifacts rather than true attachment phenomena

**Study by Crittenden and Newman (2010)**

- **Compared functioning of mothers with BPD to those without psychiatric disorders using two different AAI classification systems**: Main and Goldwyn method, Dynamic-Maturational Model method
- Using Main and Goldwyn method, no secure attachment (F) in BPD group, all had unresolved (U) status
- From DMM classification, all in BPD group were unresolved, and all had the combination A/C classification
- DMM classifications discriminated between groups more effectively than Main and Goldwyn classifications
- Mothers with BPD recalled more danger, reported more negative effects of danger, and showed more indicators of unresolved psychological trauma tied to danger
- AAIs of BPD mothers were more complex, extreme, and had more rapid shifts in arousal than those of other mothers
- Suggested women with BPD experienced dangers during childhood that were beyond their ability to cope, leading to maladaptive adaptations

**Study by Barone, Fossati, and Guiducci (2011)**

- Focused on Axis I comorbidities associated with BPD
- Previous research showed high prevalence and severity of unresolved and preoccupied states in borderline pathology
- First study to systematically compare Axis I comorbidities in relation to attachment categories and infer developmental pathways and states of mind
- Controlled key variables, used AAI as attachment assessment method
- BPD is nearly always associated with insecure states of mind, particularly E and Ds patterns
- Disorganization explained a large part of typical functioning of patients with BPD
- **Axis I comorbidity groups**: 
  - mood disorders and anxiety disorders (E overrepresentation)
  - substance abuse/dependence (Ds overrepresentation)
  - eating disorders (Ds overrepresentation)
- Nine AAI coding-system dimensions significantly associated with selected Axis I disorders among BPD participants
- Assessing adult attachment mental states useful for customizing treatment for BPD according to Axis I disorder

**Findings from Orphanage Study**

- Insecure attachment (mostly disorganized) related to mixed or borderline PD in adulthood
- Past or current trauma not significantly related to mixed or borderline PD diagnosis
- Mixed and borderline PD more related to early attachment disorganization than to trauma or abuse in later childhood or adulthood

### CONDUCT DISORDER AND ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY

**Attachment Styles and Personality Disorders: A Comparison of Studies**

**Study by Timmerman and Emmelkamp (2006)**

- Examined the relationship between attachment styles and Cluster B personality disorders in Dutch prisoners, forensic inpatients, and normal controls.
- Used the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) to assess attachment style.
- **Results**:
  - Prisoners and forensic inpatients had less secure attachment and more fearful attachment than normal controls.
  - No differences were found with respect to preoccupied and dismissing attachment.
  - Antisocial features correlated with dismissing attachment, while borderline pathology was associated with a preoccupied style.
- **Conclusion**: None of the Cluster B personality disorders were related to fearful attachment or histrionic personality pathology.

**Study by Rosenstein and Horowitz (1996)**

- Examined attachment styles in psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents with affective disorder, conduct disorder, or a combined diagnosis.
- Used the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) to determine attachment status.
- **Results**:
  - 38% of participants were classified as dismissing, 2% autonomous, 42% preoccupied, and 18% unresolved using the four-way classification system.
  - Using the three-category coding system, 3% were scored as autonomous, 47% as dismissing, and 50% as preoccupied.
  - Dismissing attachment was significantly linked to conduct disorders.
- **Conclusion**: Adolescents with a dismissing attachment organization minimize distressing thoughts and affects associated with rejection by the attachment figure, making them more likely to display overt denial or downplaying of distress in the context of psychiatric disorders like conduct disorder.

**Study by Allen et al. (1996)**

- Examined the relationship between attachment styles and criminal behavior among psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents and demographically matched nonpsychiatric high school students.
- Used the AAI to assess attachment status and self-reported criminal behavior.
- **Results**:
  - Insecure attachment at age 25 was significantly associated with self-reported criminal behavior.
  - Adults with dismissing attachment reported more criminal behavior than secure adults.
  - Young adult criminal behavior was associated with male gender, derogation of attachment relationships, and indices of lack of resolution of past trauma.

**Study by Fonagy et al. (1997; Levinson & Fonagy, 2004)**

- Gave the AAI to prisoners diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, a matched clinical group, and healthy control subjects.
- **Results**:
  - Prisoners had the lowest scores on the Reflective Functioning Scale as compared to the other two groups.
  - Crimes may be viewed as strategies initially adopted by children who receive non-optimal care to maximize parental attention.
  - Disruptive behaviors and low reflective functioning are linked.

**Study by Van IJzendoorn et al. (1997)**

- Administered the AAI to subjects incarcerated involuntarily on forensic psychiatric units after committing serious crimes.
- **Results**:
  - Disorganization (Ud/CC) was overrepresented, and secure attachment was underrepresented in these forensic subjects.
  - The total number of personality disorder symptoms was significantly related to attachment insecurity.
  - Subjects with dismissing attachment showed fewer personality disorder symptoms, while those with disorganized attachment (CC) showed more.

**Study by Frodi et al. (2001)**

- Gave the AAI and Hare Psychopathic Checklist to psychopathic criminal offenders in Sweden.
- **Results**:
  - Dismissing attachment was overrepresented in this sample, with 64% having a primary classification of dismissing attachment.
  - Subjects classified as CC made contradictory attachment representations, while subjects classified as Ds had high idealization and poor recall of childhood experiences.
- **Conclusion**: AAI classifications were not significantly associated with the degree of psychopathy as determined from the Hare results.

### Conclusions About Attachment Status and Psychopathology

**Conclusions About Attachment Status and Psychopathology**

The relationship between attachment status and psychopathology has been extensively researched using both self-report measures and interview-based assessments, particularly the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). While insecure attachment is associated with a wide range of psychiatric disorders, establishing consistent relationships between specific types of insecure attachment and specific psychiatric disorders is challenging.

**Findings from Meta-Analyses**:

1. **Van IJzendoorn and Bakermans-Kranenburg (1996)**: Clinical samples were characterized by an overrepresentation of insecure attachment, specifically the "unresolved" (U) and "dismissing" (D) categories. However, clear relationships between specific types of insecure attachment and psychopathology were not consistently supported.
2. **Bakermans-Kranenburg and van IJzendoorn (2009)**: Disorders with an internalizing dimension (e.g., borderline personality disorders) were associated with more preoccupied and unresolved attachments, whereas disorders with an externalizing dimension (e.g., antisocial personality disorders) displayed more dismissing as well as preoccupied attachments. Depressive symptomatology was associated with insecurity but not with unresolved loss or trauma, whereas adults with abuse experiences or PTSD were mostly unresolved.

**Limitations and Challenges**:

1. Failure to use a five-way or even four-way classification model in many studies.
2. Difficulties assessing attachment in individuals with complex clinical presentations, such as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), where contradictory attachment patterns may exist and cannot be easily identified without a "cannot classify" (CC) category.
3. Challenges in administering the AAI to nonnormative samples, including those with multiple caregivers, early loss of key attachment figures, extreme derogation, idealization, longing for attachment, abuse by non-family members, and psychotic processes.

**Implications**:

1. The importance of refining the CC category into subtypes to further differentiate the phenomena of attachment disorganization.
2. The need for continued research into all forms of attachment disturbance and the development of more effective assessment methods.
3. The significance of using interview-based assessments, such as the AAI, in clinical work with complex cases, including those with major dissociative disorders, borderline personality disorder, and complex PTSD.
4. The potential benefits of employing a five-way or four-way classification system to more accurately identify underlying attachment patterns.
5. The immense individual and societal toll of attachment disturbances in primary caregiving relationships.

### The Orphanage Study: Attachment and Complex Trauma

**Background**
- Daniel Brown conducted evaluations of adult survivors of childhood abuse as part of a lawsuit against a Catholic orphanage in New Orleans area (1950s-1960s)
- Allegations involved two priests and five staff members, all with prior accusations of abuse
- Organized "culture" of child abuse emerged at the orphanage, leading to extensive physical and sexual abuse of many orphans
- Most victims did not report abuse at time, forgot sexual abuse but not physical abuse
- Lawsuits settled before trial; Dr. Brown conducted forensic psychological assessments (2005-2006)

**Unique Features of the Study**
1. **Entire organized culture of child abuse**: Majority of staff allegedly participated in physical, sexual, and sadistic abuse of children.
2. **Same group of offenders**: All victims were abused by the same group during the same time frame.
3. **Attachment assessment**: Each victim was given Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) to determine attachment prototype.

**Findings**
- 60% of the 17 orphanage victims had insecure attachment, mostly disorganized type (Ud and/or CC status)
- 40% came from large, loving Catholic families with secure attachment
- Despite different backgrounds, all were abused by same offenders

**Factors Influencing Attachment Status**
1. **Chaotic family backgrounds**: Repetitive violence, alcoholism, drug rings, prostitution networks
2. **Fathers' high-risk jobs and accidents**: Oil drilling rigs, serious injuries or deaths leading to family dissolution and orphanage placement

**Implications**
The study allowed researchers to examine the impact of early attachment status and childhood abuse on adult psychopathology separately. The findings suggest that both factors contribute significantly to overall psychological issues in survivors.

**we also examined a second mixed group of CSA victims**

**Study Overview**: The study aimed to increase statistical power by examining two groups of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) victims: Group A, consisting of 17 subjects abused by the same offenders at an orphanage, and Group B, comprised of 28 adult survivors abused by different offenders.

**Group Comparison**: The statistical comparison of Group A and B found few significant differences, leading to a pooled group of 45 subjects. Key differences included higher mean unresolved score (Ud) with respect to trauma in Group A, and more depression and panic attacks in Group A according to SCID-I findings.

**Subject Demographics**: The combined 45 subjects ranged from 16 to 75 years old, with an average age of 44 years. Most were male (89%), never married (22%), had not finished high school (27%), and were Catholic (84%).

**Assessment Instruments**: All subjects underwent the same assessments:
- Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) and Experience of Close Relationships scale (ECR); 
- SCID-I for Axis I depression and anxiety conditions; 
- Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI) and Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) for PTSD; 
- SCID-D, Dissociation Questionnaire (DQ), and Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire (SDQ) for dissociative conditions; 
- SCID-II and Young Schema Questionnaire–III (YSQ-III) for Axis II conditions; 
- Index of Self Esteem (ISE), Fear of Negative Evaluation scale (FNE), and Social Avoidance and Distress Scale (SADS).

**Findings**: Preliminary analyses focused on the relationship between certain AAI measures (secure vs. insecure, coherence of transcript, and coherence of mind) and psychiatric diagnoses. High coherence of transcript and high coherence of mind were significantly associated with fewer diagnoses.

**Attachment Insecurity and Personality Disorder**: A significant relationship was found between insecure attachment and a major personality disorder when assessed using either the SCID-II or YSQ-III. Of the 25 subjects with mixed PD or BPD, 22 had insecure attachment and only 3 had secure attachment on the AAI. Similarly, low coherence of transcript was significantly related to a mixed PD or borderline PD on the SCID-II.

**Maladaptive Schemas**: Subjects with insecure attachment on the AAI were significantly more likely to have a greater number of negative, maladaptive schemas as defined by having six or more high or very high YSQ-III schema domains.

**Attachment and Dissociative Disorders**

- A study using the SCID-D (Steinberg, 1993) identified subjects with major dissociative disorders, including Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and Depersonalization Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (DDNOS).
- The combined DID/DDNOS group had two or more distinctive alter personality states or "parts."
- There was a trend towards an association between insecure attachment and DID or DDNOS, but it did not reach statistical significance.
- Low coherence of transcript and mind on the Attachment Interview (AAI) were significantly correlated with a DID/DDNOS diagnosis.

**Depersonalization and Derealization**

- Prevalence was higher in insecure subjects than secure subjects.
- Significant Chi-square was observed when AAI insecure/secure classification was cross-tabulated with subjects who had a SCID-D diagnosis of derealization or depersonalization.
- All seven subjects with a derealization diagnosis had insecure attachment and unresolved status regarding past trauma.
- 10 out of 12 subjects with a depersonalization diagnosis had insecure attachment.

**Bipolar Disorder**

- All bipolar subjects had type II (hypomania) on the SCID-I, with 11 having insecure and 3 having secure attachment on the AAI.
- Significant Chi-square was observed when insecure/secure attachment was cross-tabulated with SCID-I bipolar type II diagnostic criteria.

**Self-Esteem, Fear of Negative Evaluation, and Social Avoidance**

- Significant Chi-square was observed when insecure/secure attachment was cross-tabulated with measures of self-esteem, fear of negative evaluation, and social avoidance and distress.
- A logistic regression showed that fear of negative evaluation was sufficient to predict insecurity 73% of the time.

**Other Psychiatric Diagnoses and Alcohol/Drug Abuse or Dependency**

- No significant statistical relationships were found between insecure attachment and major depressive disorder, dysthymia, panic disorder, or somatoform disorder.
- No significant relationship was found between alcohol or drug abuse or dependency on the SCID-I and insecure status or coherence of discourse on the AAI.

**Malingering Probability Scale and Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms**

- Significant Chi-squares were observed when insecure/secure attachment was cross-tabulated with the Malingering Probability Scale (MPS) on the MAL scale and with the total malingering score on the SIRS scale.
- Subjects with higher malingering probability scores had significantly lower coherence of transcript.

**Complex Trauma**

- Complex trauma is a spectrum of conditions that includes personality changes, alterations in affect regulation and meaning systems, consciousness, self-perception, and relations with others.
- Herman (1992) hypothesized that disorders of extreme stress not otherwise specified (DESNOS) have their origins in a history of childhood trauma.
- Recent literature recognizes the importance of early attachment disturbance in the etiology of complex trauma, independent of or in combination with abuse.

**Two Pathways to Complex Trauma: Attachment and Abuse**

* Alexander's research (1993) on women survivors of childhood sexual abuse
  * Significant correlation between PTSD, other Axis I conditions, and childhood sexual abuse
  * Personality disorders linked to early childhood attachment status in addition to history of abuse
* **Two separate pathways to complex trauma**: insecure attachment (contributes to personality disorders) and abuse (contributes to PTSD and other Axis I conditions)

**Research Findings Supporting Two Pathways**

* Prospective studies on physically and sexually abused children vs. non-abused children
  * Childhood abuse causally related to psychiatric conditions in adulthood (PTSD, depression, anxiety, somatoform symptoms, addictions)
  * Emergence of multiple comorbid psychiatric conditions common
  * Use of dissociative coping style predicts greater severity and range of psychiatric conditions

**Contributions from Attachment Research**

* Early childhood insecure attachment linked to psychopathology in adolescence and adulthood
* Disorganized or resistant insecure attachment status a risk factor for personality disorders, anxiety disorders, addictions
* **Minnesota Longitudinal Study**: combination of disorganized attachment and later childhood abuse predicts dissociative disorders in adulthood

**Two Lineages of Long-term Effects of Trauma**

* **Simple PTSD**: single or cumulative traumatic events, relatively uncomplicated, manifests mainly in Axis I psychiatric conditions (PTSD, affective/depressive symptoms, addictive behaviors)
* **Complex trauma**: outcome of early childhood insecure attachment aggravated by abuse or trauma in later childhood or adulthood
  * Manifests as a combination of simple PTSD manifestations and additional disorders (somatoform symptoms, personality disorder, major dissociative disorder or multiple dissociative symptoms, multiple addictive behaviors)
  * Multiple comorbid psychiatric conditions common (5 to 10 discrete DSM diagnoses)

**Simple PTSD vs. Complex Trauma**

* **Simple PTSD**: associated with single or cumulative specific trauma events
* **Complex Trauma**: primarily associated with insecure attachment aggravated by abuse or trauma in later childhood or adulthood
* Early childhood insecure attachment is a key factor in the development of complex trauma

**Findings from Orphanage Study**

* Axis I conditions (PTSD, depression, anxiety-spectrum disorders) related to traumatic acts
* Personality disorders (borderline, dissociative disorders, bipolar type II) related to insecure attachment and low coherence of discourse on the Attachment Interview (AAI)
* **Insecure attachment disrupts developmental lines**: 
  - affect development
  - self-development
  - positive internal working models for attachment
* Long-term effects may lead to mixed or borderline personality disorder diagnosis
* Dissociative symptoms not caused by abuse per se but by early childhood insecure attachment and later trauma

**Implications for Treatment**

* Focus on trauma processing may aggravate disorganization of mind in patients with disorganized attachment
* Trauma processing contraindicated for patients with disorganized attachment aggravated by abuse in later childhood
* Treatment should primarily focus on addressing the disorganized attachment component using attachment-based methods

**False Memory Cases**

* Many lawsuits against clinicians for allegedly implanting false memories of abuse
* Patients initially came for treatment unrelated to abuse, later reported recovered memories and dissociative symptoms
* Some patients coached by attorneys and false memory proponents into believing memories were false
* Defendant clinicians engaged in systematic trauma processing but not using risky memory recovery techniques
* Trauma processing did not cause false memories but may have worsened disorganization of mind

**Conclusion**

* Complex trauma primarily caused by disorganized attachment, not trauma per se
* Treatment should focus on addressing the disorganized attachment component using attachment-based methods before processing trauma

## PART III TREATMENT BACKGROUND AND THE THREE PILLARS MODEL OF COMPREHENSIVE ATTACHMENT REPAIR 
## CHAPTER 6 An Overview of Treatments for Attachment Disturbances

- This chapter provides an overview of treatment approaches and methods for attachment disturbances, focusing on those representative of the types and forms developed since Bowlby and Ainsworth's pioneering work.
- **The following is a summary of the key concepts from this text**:

**Bowlby's Attachment-Based Psychotherapy**

- Origins of attachment-based psychotherapy go back to John Bowlby's work.
- Bowlby outlined general principles for treatment of attachment problems in "A Secure Base" (1988).
- The therapist provides a secure base, allowing the patient to explore attachment themes and past experiences.
- Focus is on the influence of early experiences on the transference relationship.
- The therapeutic alliance serves as a secure base for exploration.
- Bowlby designed his therapy for patients with disturbances in their capacities to make secure attachments due to threats or ongoing patterns of parental unresponsiveness or misresponsiveness.
- Ultimate goal is to develop a more positive internal working model for attachment.

**General Principles of Attachment-Based Psychotherapy**

*The therapist:*
1. Provides a secure base from which exploration is encouraged.
2. Offers support, encouragement, sympathy, and guidance.
3. Allows the patient to explore unhappy and painful aspects of their life.
4. Applies attachment theory to help the patient reappraise and restructure internal working models.

**Types of Attachment Disturbances**

- Disturbances can result from outright threats not to love or abandon a child, or ongoing patterns of parental unresponsiveness or misresponsiveness.
- Negative internal working models for relationships develop due to these experiences.

**Goals of Therapeutic Work**

- Develop a more positive internal working model for attachment.
- Explore attachment experiences, feelings associated with attachment, and representations and expectancies about past attachment figures.
- Reflect on the accuracy of past internal working models and develop more appropriate, positive models for healthy attachment.

### Psychoanalytic Approaches

- John Bowlby received significant attention for his work on attachment problems from the psychoanalytic community, despite departing from traditional psychoanalytic strictures.
- His ideas and practices influenced later attachment-based treatments.

**Lawrence Hedges' Approach**

- Focuses on treating severely disturbed individuals with clinically significant attachment disorders using a classical psychoanalytic approach.
- Interprets resistance to and defenses against attachment, as well as pathological manifestations of attachment behavior in the transference relationship.
- Sees psychosis as related to maternal failure in the earliest months of life (the "organizing period").
- First work is interpreting resistance to connection, then transference interpretation using a here-and-now approach.
- Interprets painful experiences, "psychotic anxieties," and distorted memories in the context of a solid working alliance.
- Treatment results in an organized mind, consolidated sense of self, reflexive mental states, and new template for relatedness.

**Malcolm West and Adrienne Keller's Approach**

- Based on Bowlby's observations on the effects of childhood loss and mourning.
- Loss is defined as the experience of what was never present or sufficiently received from attachment figures.
- Focuses on acknowledging and completing a delayed mourning process for deeply desired but unfulfilled attachments.
- Critical of defensive exclusion, preferring "defensive attachment patterns" that create relational distance.
- Therapist becomes a secure base, encouraging exploration against the background of safety.
- Dismissing patients focus on inability to feel anger and sadness, disappointment of relationships with parents.
- Anxious-preoccupied patients focus on persistent effort to recover lost relationships and associated feelings.
- Intrapsychic conflict (desire–fear drama) is central to the development of personality disorders.
- Therapist provides relational experiences missing during childhood, seen as both a reparative figure and a symbolization of earliest mother–child relationship.
- Interprets transference to separate desire from fear, allowing healthy manifestation of longing for attachment.
- Deferential stance by therapist leads to new representations of attachment and new modes of action.

### Attachment-Informed Psychotherapy

* Emerged as a response to the lessening adherence to strict psychoanalytic notions in psychotherapy
* Maintains focus on intrapsychic functioning, but also emphasizes cognitive and relational capacities, and systemic factors
* Draws from attachment theory and research, as well as other psychological understandings

**Attachment, Intimacy, Autonomy (Holmes, 1996)**

* Aims to develop secure attachment and healthy self-autonomy
* **Goals**:
  * **Attachment system**: adult intimacy
  * **Exploratory system**: autonomy of the self
* Therapist behaves like a responsive, attuned parent-figure
* Process of therapy is a microcosm of attachment and separation

**Secure Base and Therapeutic Stance**

* Establishing a secure base with the therapist
* **Signs of developing a secure base**: protest and proximity-seeking
* **Therapeutic stance**: interested nonreactivity
  * Object is held and cherished but not controlled
  * Capacity for detached reflection
  * Stay in the present moment

**Dual Focus of Treatment and Nonattachment**

* A robust sense of autonomy based on internalization of intimate relationships
* True intimacy requires respect for other's autonomy
* **Nonattachment**: synthesizing autonomy and intimacy at a higher level
* Ruptures and failures of empathy serve as basis for new internal working model of attachment
* Development of a healing narrative leads to tolerance of separation anxiety and autonomy

**Differential Treatment of Attachment Patterns**

* **Dismissing**: establish emotional contact
* **Anxious-preoccupied**: express appropriate anger at separation, learn that therapy will survive
* **Disorganized**: unhook role-reversing patterns, move beyond longing and loss (patients may develop borderline personality disorder)

### CLINICAL PATTERNS OF ATTACHMENT

**Attachment and Adult Psychotherapy: A Bowlby-Based Approach by Pat Sable**

**Background**
- Sable presents an attachment perspective for treating attachment disorders in adults, not an attachment-based treatment (Sable, 2000, p. 88)
- Attachment theory provides a way to understand patients' experiences (p. 88)

**Bowlby's Theory of Attachment Relevant to Psychotherapy**
1. Attachment is about safety and protection
2. Seeking proximity and emotional availability of therapist
3. Attachment behavior is lifelong and active throughout the life-cycle (pp. 11–12, 29)
4. Individuals lack confidence in the availability of affectional figures due to failed experiences (p. 101)
5. **Major goal**: modify dysfunctional internal working models (IWMs) of attachment (p. 80)
6. IWMs are active and capable of updating expectations and plans (p. 29)

**Attachment-Informed Psychotherapy**
1. Establish therapist as a stable attachment figure (pp. 111, 332)
   - Provides a secure base for exploration (p. 332)
   - Rooted in new relationship (p. 332)
   - Safe base fosters self-reliance (p. 144)
2. Unique features of therapy relationship (pp. 239, 333, 336, 338)
   - Regular appointments and availability
   - Emotional availability and regulation of affect
   - Affective attunement
3. Exploration of early dysfunctional attachment experiences (pp. 332–333)
   - Retrieving memories and feelings
   - Validating emotions
   - Mapping out past IWMs
   - Correcting transference distortions
   - Developing a coherent narrative
4. Understanding how working models have been generated and maintained (p. 331)
5. Helps patients move away from abusive affectional ties towards healthier relationships (p. 299)
6. Leads to greater self-reliance based on confidence in the therapist (pp. 144, 151)

**Dynamic-Maturational Model Integrative Treatment (DMM)**

* Developed by Patricia Crittenden
* Attachment behavior reflects organized strategies for coping with danger and seeking protection
* Maladaptive behavior results from exposure to unprotected and uncomforted danger
* Focus on repairing and modifying problematic dynamics within individuals and family systems
* Parents' experiences and coping strategies are crucial in addressing attachment issues
* **Goal**: Enable individuals to generate and apply self-protective strategies effectively

**Commonalities**

* Both approaches emphasize the importance of attachment and its impact on behavior
* Therapist plays a significant role in providing safety and security
* Encourage exploration of current attachment patterns and their applicability
* Focus on enabling individuals to develop adaptive strategies for various situations

**Attachment-Based Psychotherapy (ABP)**

* **Therapist's Role**: Maintain sensitivity, emotional availability, flexibility, and reliability as a secure base
* Encourage patients to reflect on their current attachment strategies and their appropriateness
* Explore experiences within and outside therapy and compare with childhood perceptions
* Help patients recognize that painful experiences are outdated and inappropriate for current relationships
* **Goal**: Establish greater awareness of attachment patterns and their applicability in current life

**Dynamic-Maturational Model Integrative Treatment (DMM)**

* **Parents**: Focus on parents' experiences, psychological resolution, and emotional balance to provide protection and soothing
* Repair and modify problematic dynamics within individuals and family systems
* **Goal**: Enable parents to respond effectively with appropriate protection and soothing when children experience danger
* Preventive against the emergence or continuation of problematic strategies in children (Raising Parents)
* Core principles can be applied even when family members cannot or will not participate
* **Central issue**: Enabling individuals to generate and apply self-protective strategies effectively
* Create a safe environment for learning new strategies without fear or threat
* Repair, free of erroneous information, and apply strategies with greater specificity
* Develop a wider repertoire of strategies for various situations
* **Long-term goal**: Change information processing to promote adaptive behavior in current and future circumstances

**Comparison**

* Both approaches emphasize the importance of attachment and its impact on behavior
* Differences lie mainly in their focus and application (individual vs. family system)
* Both encourage exploration of current attachment patterns and their applicability
* **Goals**: Help individuals develop adaptive strategies for various situations and enable parents to respond effectively with protection and soothing when children experience danger.

**Dynamic-Maturational Model (DMM) Integrated Treatment**

* **Essential components**: good assessment, formulation, and therapeutic relationships (Crittenden, 2008)

**Assessment**

* Yields information about dispositional representations (DRs) and protective attachment strategies (A, B, C patterns)
* Individualized formulations for each patient
* Condition-based formulations for diagnostic conditions (e.g., eating disorders, PTSD)

**Formulation**

* Draws from assessment information
* Understands intrapersonal, interpersonal, and familial problems
* Guides selection of treatment tools

**Therapeutic Relationship**

* Essential for successful treatment
* Empirically founded recommendations less established than assessment and formulation
* Critical of manualized treatments and fitting patients to techniques

**General Principles of Treatment**:
1. **Danger and safety**:
   - Address patient's experience of danger in past, present, and future
   - Establish sense of safety
   - Consider potential dangers associated with therapy itself or modification of information-processing strategies
2. **Affect regulation**:
   - Help patients manage emotions
   - Develop skills for emotional self-regulation
3. **Interpersonal communication**:
   - Improve communication between family members
   - Encourage effective problem-solving and conflict resolution
4. **Cognitive restructuring**:
   - Challenge maladaptive thoughts and beliefs
   - Replace with adaptive ones
5. **Behavioral change**:
   - Teach new skills and behaviors
   - Reinforce desired behaviors
6. **Relationship building**:
   - Strengthen therapeutic relationship
   - Encourage attachment security and bonding between family members

**Techniques**:
- Elicit discovery, foster exploration, encourage practice
- May include medication, individual sessions, group sessions, inpatient hospitalization, or social service interventions

**Importance of Assessment and Formulation**:
- Individualized treatment based on unique needs of the patient
- Prevent missing the patient's needs or causing harm with misfit techniques
- Consistent with parenting based on attunement to child's characteristics and developmental stage.

### Therapists as transitional attachment figures.

**Section 1: Therapists as Transitional Attachment Figures**

* The central work of therapy involves recognizing, exploring, and modifying information-processing strategies associated with insecurity. (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 314)
* Therapists function most effectively when they act as transitional attachment figures, bridging the gap between frightening perceptions and accurate understanding. (Crittenden et al., 2014, pp. 158-159)

**Qualities of a Transitional Attachment Figure**

* **Compassionate**: Showing understanding and concern for the patient's experiences. (Crittenden et al., 2014, p. 159)
* **Accepting**: Validating the patient's feelings and experiences without judgment. (Crittenden et al., 2014, p. 159)
* **Attuned**: Responding appropriately to the patient's emotional states. (Crittenden, 2008, p. 306)
* **Sensitively responsive**: Adjusting therapeutic interventions based on the patient's needs. (Crittenden, 2008, p. 305)
* **Genuine feeling**: Expressing authentic emotions, particularly comfort. (Crittenden, 2008, p. 306)

**The Role of the Patient in Forming a Secure Base**

* A therapist can provide a secure base, but the patient's desire for one is essential. (Crittenden, 2008, p. 305)
* The relationship between therapist and patient is both the process and the goal of treatment. (p. 264)

**Regulating Arousal**

- Helping patients regulate arousal supports access to motivation, stability, and essential mental processes for therapy.
- Maintaining an appropriate level of arousal is crucial for effective therapy.

**Crittenden's Model of Attachment and Psychotherapy: Components of Treatment**

**1. **Establishing a Secure Base**:
- Creating a safe therapeutic relationship
- Building trust and attachment between therapist and patient
- Providing emotional containment and regulation

**2. **Quieting traumatic responses to current conditions**:
*Effective exploration of unresolved traumas and losses:*
  - Unresolved traums and losses require explicit discussion
  - Identifying forms of unresolved loss (12 possibilities) and trauma (14 possibilities) in patients' discourse
  - Tailoring focus and intervention based on identified forms
*Value of DMM-AAI assessment formulation*

**3. **Regulating arousal**:
- Protecting against large fluctuations in patient's arousal
- Supporting effective therapy process
- Highlighting maladaptive coping strategies brought into current circumstances

**4. **Increasing family members’ (patients’) repertoire of protective strategies**:
*Acquiring additional adaptive strategies:*
  - Beneficial effects of regulating arousal and quieting traumatic responses may lead to symptom reduction but not complete resolution
  - Adding new strategies to existing ones enhances resilience against past poorly adapted conditions
*Functional formulation:*
  - Identifying patient's typical existing strategies of information processing
  - Selecting appropriate treatment focus and method based on identified strategies
  - Protecting against iatrogenic worsening of a patient's state
*Considerations for Type A and Type C strategies:*
  - Opposite processes, requiring opposite forms of treatment
  - Effects on patients' ways of being in treatment

**5. **Reaching coherence and resilience**:
- Promoting further resilience within current and unfamiliar circumstances
- Reflective and integrative process
- Understanding past experiences, self-protective strategies, influence of change, and emerging ability to regulate development in the future
- Greater flexibility, satisfaction, compassionate understanding, and optimism.

**Crittenden's Treatment Model**

- Emphasizes goal-setting and working within the patient's zone of proximal development (ZPD) (Crittenden et al., 2014, p. 161)
  - Importance of reflective approaches to therapy for integrative step (p. 160)
  - Full integration not possible before late adolescence due to complex cortical processing (p. 160)
- **Relevant reflective approaches**: Fonagy's approach to reflective function and mentalization (Crittenden & Landini, 2011, p. 40)
  - Mentalization-based methods appropriate for this component of treatment (e.g., Allen, Fonagy, & Bateman, 2008)
- Importance of metaprocessing with the patient during later phases of treatment (Fosha, 2009a, p. 187)
- Strengths and appropriateness for individuals, families, and larger systems (Crittenden et al., 2014, p. 161)
- Tailored interventions based on individual's developmental needs and capacities (Crittenden & Dallos, 2014, p. 57)

**Attachment Representations and Internal Working Models**

- Central contribution of Bowlby's recognition of internal working models or representations of attachment relationships and experiences (Bowlby)
- **Several approaches work directly with patients’ mental representations related to attachment**:
  - Crittenden's model focuses on dysfunctional attachment representations and ZPD (Crittenden & Dallos, 2014, p. 57)
  - Targeting preconscious DRs (Developmental Representation) with school-aged children to connect them with verbal forms of representation (p. 57)
  - Parents might consider verbal episodes for adults and play enactments for toddlers (p. 57)

### WORKING WITH ATTACHMENT REPRESENTATIONS INDEPENDENT OF TRANSFERENCE

**Working with Attachment Representations: A Psychodynamic Approach by Michael Sperling and Lisa Sandow Lyons (1994)**

**Overview**:
Sperling and Lyons propose a psychodynamically based approach to treating attachment disorders that focuses on identifying and modifying representations of attachment, rather than interpreting transference. Their approach is informed by the definition of Internal Working Models (IWMs) of attachment.

**Attachment Representations**:
- **IWMs**: A set of rules for organizing information relevant to attachment and accessing it (Main, Kaplan, & Cassidy, 1985)
- Sperling and Lyons argue against interpreting reenactments of early attachment experiences in the transference
- Instead, they focus on identifying and modifying attachment representations

**Identifying Attachment Representations**:
- Vigilantly attend to patient's report of current and past attachment experiences
- Discerning emergent representational patterns
- Identify main patterns in patient's relationships

**Modifying Attachment Representations**:
- Guiding the patient in constructing defining relational narratives
- Allowing patient to develop conscious awareness of idiosyncratic rules and expectations
- Using these rules as anticipatory markers against which new experiences can be compared and evaluated

**Interpretive Process**:
- Interpretations focus on patterns of experience rather than transference with the therapist
- Therapist is actively involved in identification and understanding of patient's attachment representations
- Interpretive process takes on a psychoeducational quality

**Developing New, Healthy Attachment Relational Narratives**:
- Modifying IWMs to develop new, healthy attachment relational narratives.

### IMAGERY OF THE GOOD-ENOUGH THERAPIST TOGETHER WITH THE PATIENT

- Elgan Baker introduced a method for enhancing relatedness in psychotic and borderline patients with attachment disturbances (Baker, 1981).
- Based on British object relations theory, focusing on internalization and organization of interpersonal relationships.
- Primitive forms of psychopathology conceptualized as structural deficits in ego formation due to difficulties in developmental tasks.

**Fostering Attachment**:

- More active and nurturing role for the therapist.
- Enhancing attachment by gratifying dependency strivings.
- Maintaining connectedness during regression.
- Avoiding untoward regression.
- Therapist as a real object who can "hold" boundaries of reality.
- Patient forms stable internal representation (introject) of the "good enough" therapist.

**Advantages of Hypnotic Imagery**:

1. Heightened state of attentiveness.
2. Greater inward orientation and less orientation to outside reality.
3. Greater access to internal emotions and memories.
4. More vivid and readily available imagery.
5. Highly structured relationship with therapist control.

**Seven Steps of Treatment**:

1. Patient imagines himself/herself in pleasant activities, evoking a positive representation of self.
2. Patient opens eyes to reassure self that therapist is present.
3. Patient repeatedly imagines therapist as benign and supportive presence.
4. Patient imagines himself/herself and therapist together with proximity, preserving clear boundaries.
5. Patient imagines coordinated interactions, internalizing therapist as a "good object."
6. Patient externalizes malignant internal voices or representations.
7. Dynamic exploration of dysfunctional patterns and integrating positive and negative images.

**Unique Features**:

- Co-created attachment imagery in ongoing dyadic exchange between patient and therapist.
- Refusal to use canned scripts for what to say during the imagery.
- Systematic introduction of positive relational imagery is an important ingredient of attachment-based treatment.

### New Forms of Attachment-Informed Treatment

* In recent years, new psychotherapeutic methods have been introduced for patients with attachment disturbances and personality disorders.
* These approaches are integrative and draw from various research areas.

**Schema Therapy for Patients with Personality Disorders**

* Developed by Jeffrey Young, Janet Klosko, and Marjorie Weishaar as an alternative to cognitive-focused techniques for personality disorders.
* Based on emotion-focused or experiential methods.
* Central concept is "Early Maladaptive Schemas," self-defeating emotional and cognitive patterns that begin in childhood and repeat throughout life, based on unmet core emotional needs.
* **18 different schemas categorized into five broad schema domains**: 
  - Disconnection and Rejection
  - Impaired Autonomy and Performance
  - Impaired Limits
  - Other-Directedness
  - Overvigilance and Inhibition.
* Goal is to identify salient maladaptive schemas and heal them through diminishing memories, emotions, bodily sensations, and cognitions associated with them.

**Schema Healing**

* **Schema healing involves diminishing all aspects of a schema**: memories, emotions, bodily sensations, and cognitions.
* Treatment begins with assessment to bring salient maladaptive schemas into patient's awareness.
* Understanding the origins of schemas in childhood is crucial.
* Therapist serves as an ally against maladaptive schemas and a parental model for limited reparenting.

**Limited Reparenting**

* Supplying emotional experiences within ethical and professional boundaries to meet patients' basic emotional needs.
* **Goal**: Patient internalizes a Healthy Adult mode.
* Consistent way of interacting with a patient designed to heal specific Early Maladaptive Schemas, especially those in the Disconnection and Rejection domain.

**Experiential Techniques**

* Utilize imagery and schema mode dialogues to trigger emotions connected to Early Maladaptive Schemas.
* Safe-place imagery followed by evoking negative affect associated with early childhood experiences.
* Therapist enters patient's images as a Healthy Adult to reparent the child, teaching patients there are other ways parents might have treated them.
* **Aim**: Patient develops an internalized healthy adult representation modeled after the therapist.

**Schema Therapy**

- Therapist enters imagery to care for traumatized child part of patient
  - Removes child, confronts perpetrator, stands between, or empowers child
  - Patient eventually takes over role of Healthy Adult and reparents child

**Experiential Technique: Dialogues and Schema Mode Dialogues**

- Establish safe-place imagery
- Patient pictures self with parent in upsetting situation
- Carry on dialogue with parent about needs at the time
- Consider how patient would like parent to change or be different
- Primary dialogues are between Vulnerable Child, Healthy Adult, and Dysfunctional Parent

**Schema Modes**

- Moment-to-moment emotional states and coping responses
- Predominant state is called schema mode
- **Group into parts of self**: child modes, maladaptive coping modes, dysfunctional parent modes, healthy adult mode

**Child Modes**

- Vulnerable Child
- Angry Child
- Impulsive Child
- Happy Child

**Maladaptive Coping Modes**

- Compliant Surrender
- Detached Protector
- Overcompensator

**Dysfunctional Parent Modes**

- Punitive Parent
- Demanding Parent

**Healthy Adult Mode**

- Replaces therapist in imagery as patient internalizes therapist behaviors

**Goals of Schema Mode Therapy**

- Access and initiate dialogue among schema modes to resolve conflicts
- Behavioral homework assignments for practicing adaptive responses
- Target self-defeating coping strategies and replace with adaptive ones
- Change most salient maladaptive schemas

**Attachment Informed Approach**

- Therapist becomes stable base for patient's identity and self-acceptance
- Patient internalizes therapist behaviors as their own Healthy Adult mode

**Outcome Study**

- Schema therapy effect size nearly double that of transference-focused treatment in treating borderline personality disorder (Geisen-Bloo et al., 2006)

### ACCELERATED EXPERIENTIAL DYNAMIC PSYCHOTHERAPY (AEDP)

* Innovative attachment-informed treatment developed by Diana Fosha
* **Main focus**: facilitating affect experience and transformation through patient's engagement with therapist as a good attachment figure

**Core Affect**

* Vital, spontaneous emotional responses when defensive strategies are not in operation
* **Defining feature**: engenders healing state transformation when experienced without defenses
* **Goal of AEDP**: increase availability and stability of core affect

**Treatment Process**

* Establish therapeutic holding environment
	+ Secure, emotionally facilitating dyadic relationship
	+ Qualities of therapist's ways of being with the patient
		- Empathic attunement
		- Recognition, affirmation, validation, and valuing of patient's experience
		- Expressing care, compassion, concern
		- Authenticity and active use of therapist's own affective experience
		- Offering encouragement and being helpful
		- Expressing delight in the patient
* Facilitate core affect to promote emergence of core states
* **Primary task**: attentively track moment-by-moment fluctuations in patient's affective state
* Three processes of dyadic interaction supporting beneficial transformations
	+ Ongoing regulations
	+ Heightened affective moments
	+ Disruption and repair of ongoing regulations

**Core States**

* Altered condition of openness and contact
* Individual is deeply in touch with essential aspects of self and relational experience.

**Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy (AEDP)**

* Developed by Diana Fosha
* **Focuses on**:
  * Dyadic interaction
  * Therapist's ways of being with the patient
  * Patient's somatic experience
  * Metatherapeutic processing or metaprocessing

**Metaprocessing**

* Direct, focused attention to and reflection on experiences of affective transformation
* Unleashes transformational process
* Consolidates, deepens, and expands changes

**AEDP Process**

**State One**:

* Patient comes in a state with distress and symptoms
* **Underlying issues**: dysregulated affects, inhibiting affects (anxiety, shame), defenses
* Defensive reactions as failure of caregiving environment
* Transformative strivings and self-at-best present
* Dyadic attunement to patient's vitality affects reduces defenses and supports transformation

**Signs of Transformation**:

* **Green signal affects**: greater openness to experience
* **Heralding affects**: early signs of core affective experience
* **Transitional affects**: mix of emerging core affect and defensive caution

**First State Transformation**:

* Full experience of a specific core affective phenomenon

**State Two**:

* Patient feels safe in therapeutic dyad
* Emotional processing work can be launched
* Processing emotional experiences
* Appearance of categorical emotions (grief, anger, fear, sadness, joy, disgust)
* Dyadic support and affect regulation leads to relief, clarity, hope, strength, adaptive action tendencies

**Second State Transformation**:

* Newly established ability to allow and regulate affect
* Processing of transformational experience
* **Characteristic affects**: 
  - mastery affects (pride, joy, confidence)
  - emotional pain from mourning the self
  - tremulous affects (fear/excitement startle/surprise)
  - healing affects (gratitude for changes)
  - realization affects (new understanding)
* Shifting from core affect to core state

**State Three**:

* Processing of transformational experience
* **Characteristic affects**: mastery affects, emotional pain, tremulous affects, healing affects, realization affects
* Patient experiences calm, clarity, openness, profoundly satisfying state of ease and relaxation, aliveness and vitality, wisdom, compassion for self and others, generosity, vibrant wellbeing, equanimity, confidence, creativity, naturalness, enhanced initiative and agency, sense of the sacred

**State Four**:

* Transformation into core state associated with security of attachment
* Core state prominent and available
* Patient manifests self and relational characteristics beyond features of attachment security
* **Defining qualities of core state**: wisdom, compassion for self and others, generosity, vibrant wellbeing, equanimity, confidence, creativity, naturalness, enhanced initiative and agency, sense of the sacred
* **Affective marker for core state is the truth sense**: vitality affect whose felt sense is an aesthetic experience of rightness.

**Unique Contribution**:

* Elaborately detailed description of thorough affect transformation in a dyadic patient-therapist attachment relationship
* All affective states, in an adequate holding environment, are seeds for deeply transformative experience and development.

### Intersubjectivity-Based Treatment

* Influenced by Beebe and Lachmann's work on intersubjectivity in the field of attachment
* Integrated into Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy (AEDP)
* Based on research on intersubjectivity in infant-mother interactions

**Intersubjectivity and Adult Treatment**

* Beebe and Lachmann presented a model for treating adults with attachment disturbances based on their research on intersubjectivity
* Discovered coordinated nonverbal communication patterns between infants and caregivers, leading to self-agency and effectance
* Secure dyads have synchronized, rhythmic, and highly coordinated nonverbal behavior
* Moment-by-moment exchange is represented within the infant's mind in a presymbolic, procedural form
* **Three principles of salience**: 
  - self-regulation and interactive regulation
  - disruption and repair
  - optimal engagement and heightened positive affect
* Primary intersubjectivity emerges from these principles
* Collaborative interactions vs. contradictory dialogues
	+ Collaborative: self-regulation, interactive regulation, and mutual engagement
	+ Contradictory: significant nonverbal mismatching, lack of contingent influence, lack of coordination, and absence of synchronization and timing
* Infants who experience sustained contradictory dialogues develop expectation of misregulation and insecure attachment patterns

**Treatment Approach for Adults with Attachment Disturbances**

* Emphasizes attunement to nonverbal exchange between patient and therapist
* **Careful observation of nonverbal behavior**: head orientation, body posture, gaze, facial affect display, rhythm, pitch, tone, and timing of verbal responses
* Therapist matches and rematches patient's nonverbal behavior
* Addresses patterns of distancing or hyperengaging nonverbal behavior in the patient
* **Two methods for treating nonverbal intersubjectivity failures**:
	+ Sustained collaborative, noncontradictory nonverbal responsiveness from therapist
	+ Intersubjective method of bringing attention to the intersubjective dynamic during therapy sessions (e.g., watching videotapes together)
* Recommended for therapists treating patients with insecure attachment to become familiar with these intersubjective principles and practices

### EXPLORATORY PSYCHOTHERAPY

**Exploratory Psychotherapy and Attachment Therapy**

- Dorothy Heard, Brian Lake, and Una McCluskey extended Bowlby's attachment theory in their book "Attachment Therapy With Adolescents and Adults" (2009)
- Introduced a comprehensive theory of attachment and a new attachment paradigm
- **Extended Bowlby's thinking on behavioral systems beyond the attachment system**: collaborative interest-sharing, affectional sexuality, personal defense, external lifestyle
- Nonverbal emotive signals and body language play an essential role in intersubjectivity
- Emotive nonverbal signals reflect intersubjectivity through intricate rhythmic patterns of dyadic exchange

**Intersubjectivity**

- Mutually regulating process between two people
- **Three deepening aspects and levels**:
  - Immediate sense of interpersonal communion
  - Joint attention to objects of reference in a shared domain of conversation
  - Reflective and recursive communication of understanding
- Caregiver's affect attunement vs. purposeful misattunement
- Self grows and develops apart from attachment relationship
- **Secure self during subjectivity**: imaginative, creative, and able to play

**Behavioral Systems and the Secure Self**

- Each behavioral system serves a different function and reflects the self in various ways
- Threat activates defensive or fear behavioral system and defensive self
- Mutual interests activate collaborative behavioral system and interest in sharing the self
- **Exploratory psychotherapy's objective**: full potential of secure and autonomous self

**Exploratory Psychotherapy**

- Patient initiates relationship with therapist as caregiver due to decreased wellbeing or threat
- **First task**: attenuate fear system, activate attachment system in relation to therapist
- Secure base established for exploration of the self across each behavioral system
- Importance of secure base for therapeutic exploration
- Quality of nonverbal dyadic exchange crucial for restoring wellbeing and establishing a secure base

**Care-seeking Behaviors and Caregiving Responses**

- **Five typical care-seeking behaviors**: 
  - openness
  - avoidance
  - discussing concerns tangled with caregiver's state of mind
  - dismissal
  - being overwhelmed
- **Five potential caregiving responses**:
  - careful attunement
  - misattunement followed by repair
  - defection from exploration
  - withdrawal and immobilization
  - becoming disorganized
- 25 possible patterns of interaction based on all combinations of the above
- **Common nonverbal and verbal misattunements by therapists**: interrupting, failing to regulate patient's state of mind, minimal or misattuned response, avoiding facial displays of affect, discrepancy between verbal and nonverbal responsiveness, ignoring immediate signs of fear activation, missing patient's affect and pursuing other issues
- Learning effective caregiving through video recordings and training helps therapists genuinely attune to patients and restore wellbeing, establish a secure base, and enable exploration.

### Metacognitive Attachment-Informed Psychotherapies

* Metacognitive functioning and its role in attachment have gained attention in recent years.
* Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT) is an approach developed by Peter Fonagy, Anthony Bateman, Jon Allen, and their colleagues to treat patients with personality and dissociative disorders.

**Mentalization**

* Defined as making sense of actions based on intentional mental states.
* Develops over the first five years of childhood in secure attachment relationships.
* Involves recognizing that mental states exist independently from actions.
* Developed through contingent responsiveness and marking by caregivers.
* Results in the capacity to reflect on emotions, beliefs, wishes, and needs (second-order representations).
* Allows for affect regulation and impulse control.
* Facilitates mentalization, or the ability to think about mental states as separate from actions.
* Enhances reflective capacity, which is essential for secure attachment and healthy development.

**Stages of Mentalization Development**

1. **Contingent responsiveness**: newborn discovers caregiver's responsiveness is contingent on their actions.
2. **Representation of self as an active agent**: infant develops a sense of self as a cause of caregiver's reactions.
3. **Contingent mirroring**: caregiver signals that they are expressing the child's emotions, not their own.
4. **Internalization of empathic expression**: child develops secondary representation of emotional state with caregiver's empathic face as signifier and their own emotional arousal as signified.
5. **Emergence of second-order representations**: child can reflect on emotions, beliefs, wishes, and needs.
6. **Mentalization occurs**: child integrates various modes to arrive at mentalization, or reflective mode.

**Mentalization in Therapy**

* Enhances reflective processes and fosters the development of stable internal representations.
* Helps borderline patients form more secure relationships by understanding motivations of self and other.
* **London School approaches**:
  * **Mentalizing therapeutic stance (Jon Allen)**: therapist maintains a mentalizing stance to enable patient to discover their mind in the therapist's mind.
  * Mentalizing-specific skills (not explicitly stated in text).

**Assessing Reflective Functioning**

* Reflective Functioning Scale (RF-S) developed by Fonagy, Target, and Steele to assess reflective functioning in adults.
* PD and DD patients typically score below 3 on the RF-S, indicating a significant lack of reflective capacity.

**Tips for Therapists on Influencing Mentalizing** (Allen, 2013)

1. Use clear language and avoid jargon.
2. Encourage patients to label emotions and thoughts.
3. Reflect back emotions and thoughts to patients.
4. Help patients understand the connection between thoughts, feelings, and actions.
5. Avoid making assumptions about patients' mental states.
6. Use metaphors and analogies to help patients understand complex concepts.
7. Encourage patients to consider alternative perspectives.
8. Validate patients' emotions and thoughts.
9. Help patients identify patterns in their thinking and behavior.
10. Provide a safe and consistent therapeutic environment.
11. Use nonverbal communication effectively.
12. Be open and authentic in your interactions with patients.
13. Encourage patients to engage in reflective practice outside of sessions.
14. Help patients understand the role of attachment in their mentalizing capacity.

**Mentalizing-Based Therapy (MBT)**

**Promoting mentalizing**:
- Maintaining a curious and not-knowing stance
- Offering simple interventions
- **Emotional engagement**: neither too hot nor too cold
- Secure base experience for patients' exploration of mental states
- Balancing self and other mental state exploration
- **Mirroring process**: reflecting emotional responsiveness back to patient
- Judicious self-disclosure
- Validating patient's experience before offering alternative perspectives
- Multiple perspectives on interactions and experiences
- Allowing for correction of therapist's misunderstandings
- Acknowledging mistakes and exploring own contribution
- Challenging unwarranted assumptions about attitudes, feelings, and beliefs
- Working with the therapeutic relationship

**Undermining mentalizing**:
- Striving to be clever or insightful
- Complicated, lengthy interventions
- Presenting ideas with certainty
- Attributing mental states based on theoretical preconceptions
- Engaging in "psychobabble"
- Prolonged silences
- Generalizing patient's experiences without exploring basis
- Intense reactive (nonmentalized) emotional responses

**Experience of Understanding and Mentalization**:
- Feeling understood generates a sense of security
- Therapist constructs image of patient's mind, labels feelings, explains cognitions
- Mirroring process fosters mentalizing and secure attachment experience
- Recognition creates secure base feeling, promotes exploration and coherent self

**MBT Techniques (Bateman & Fonagy)**:

**Approach 1**:
- Consistency, constancy, and coherence in therapist's stance
- **Enhancing mentalization**: adopting mentalizing stance, focusing on emotional states

**Approach 2**:
- Bridging the gap between affects and their representation
  * Identifying affect
  * Interpreting moment-by-moment changes in emotional state
  * Contingent mirroring and marking of affective states
  * Understanding immediate antecedents to emotional states
  * Clarifying and elaborating meaning of affective states
  * Improving emotional control
  * Placing feelings in context
  * Learning to express feelings appropriately

**Core strategies for developing mentalization**:
1. Enhancing mentalizing
2. Bridging the gap between affects and their representation
3. Working mostly with current mental states
4. Keeping in mind the patient's deficits

**Mentalized affectivity**:
- Capacity to connect consciousness of an affective state to its experience at a constitutional level
- Establishing congruent connections between primary and secondary affect-representational structures
- Focus on emotion ensures reconnection and correction of misconnections

**Working with cognitive states**:
1. Identifying primary maladaptive beliefs
2. Reflecting on beliefs about these beliefs and their fears and wishes (aboutness)
3. Identifying ruptures in the here-and-now process
4. **Mentalizing the transference**: highlighting underlying motives
5. **Keeping in mind patient's deficits**: encouraging mentalizing without demanding it

**Long-term effects**:
- Coherent sense of self
- Capacity for second-order regulation of emotional states
- Capacity for secure intimacy

**Outcome data on MBT**:
- Impressive results in improving mentalization and attachment security (Bateman & Fonagy, 1999, 2001, 2008, 2009)

### THE MODULAR APPROACH TO METACOGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT

**Modular Approach to Metacognitive Development: The Rome School**

The Rome School of metacognition, in contrast to the London School, views reflective capacity as having a modular structure with discrete components or subfunctions. They have identified six specific metacognitive skills, or modules:

1. **Identification**: Ability to distinguish, recognize, and define one's own inner states (emotions, cognitions).
2. **Differentiation**: Ability to recognize that mental contents are subjective events and distinguish fantasy from reality.
3. **Relating variables**: Ability to establish relations among separate components of a mental state and between components of mental states and behavior.
4. **Integration**: Ability to work out coherent descriptions of one's mental state and processes, showing consistency from one state to the next.
5. **Decentration**: Ability to comprehend another individual's mental state from a non-egocentric perspective.
6. **Mastery**: Ability to work through representations and mental states with a view to implementing effective action strategies.

**Metacognitive Deficits in Psychiatric Disorders**

The Rome School discovered that patients with different psychiatric diagnoses manifest different metacognitive deficits:

- **Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)**: Poor at differentiation, integration, and mastery.
- **Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)**: Good at metacognitive mastery but poor at identifying states of mind in themselves and others.
- **Major Dissociative Disorders**: Poor at metacognitive identification and even worse at integration.

**Metacognitive-Based Treatment**

The Rome group offers a broad outline of their metacognitive-based treatment:

1. Generate a good emotional atmosphere in sessions.
2. Develop metacognitive skills through validation, therapist self-disclosure, and sharing experiences.
3. Encourage patients to utilize metacognitive reflection on problematic states as they occur.

**Liotti's Theory and Approach for BPD and DID**

Liotti's theory focuses on the long-term consequences of early childhood disorganized attachment, aggravated by abuse in later childhood:

1. Disorganized attachment is characterized by multiple, fragmented, and incoherent internal working models (IWMs).
2. Patients with PDs or DDs typically activate another behavioral system when they experience threat instead of the attachment system.
3. Shifting mental states can be carefully tracked within and across treatment sessions, and intervention can be designed to activate therapeutic behavioral systems.

**Unique Features of Liotti's Theory**

1. **Expansion of Bowlby's concept of behavioral systems**: fear system, attachment system, cooperation and collaboration, social rank, and sexual behavioral system.
2. **Interaction of specific behavioral systems**: any behavioral system can become activated at any point in a treatment session.
3. Understanding the patient's shifting mental states within the therapeutic relationship to design effective interventions.

**Liotti's Discovery and Its Implications for Attachment-Based Therapy**

* Activation of attachment behavioral system in PD (Personality Disorders) and DD (Disorganized Attachment) patients early in treatment leads to a decrease, not an increase, in mentalization due to disorganization and overwhelm.
* Prunetti et al. found that validation interventions activate emotional closeness and attachment system, leading to temporary metacognitive failure and decreased mentalization capacity (Prunetti et al., 2008).

**Impact of Attachment System Activation on Mentalization**

* Disorganizing activation of the attachment system significantly hinders patient's metacognitive abilities.
* Shifting discourse to a collaborative mode between therapist and patient can benefit the patient by activating the cooperative behavioral system, which is essential for mentalization function once stability and safety are reestablished.

**Collaborative Behavioral System: Conceptual Groundwork**

* The cooperative behavioral system is an inborn motivational system necessary for group survival (Liotti, 1999).
* Superior cooperative abilities helped early human groups compete favorably with less cooperative groups during the period of our direct homo ancestors (Cortina & Liotti, 2010).
* PD and DD patients rarely experienced cooperation on equal grounds in their family of origin (Liotti, 2005), so attachment-based therapists explicitly introduce collaboration at the onset and throughout treatment.

**Therapeutic Strategies: Shifting from Attachment to Cooperation**

* Explicit agreement of goals and rules of therapeutic work is constructed at the beginning of treatment to establish a joint formulation of a shared goal for the treatment (Liotti, 1999).
* Shifting discourse to a collaborative mode between therapist and patient once stability and safety are reestablished can help activate mentalization function.

**Mentalization Deficits and Context-Specificity**

* Mentalization deficits in PD and DD patients are associated with certain behavioral systems more than others, and within a given system, they occur in some contexts more than others (Liotti & Gilbert, 2011).
* Attachment processes may allow for the recovery of mentalization in the presence of danger through contact with an attachment figure that provides help and guidance and activates a renewed sense of safety and soothing.

**Collaborative Foundation in Therapy**

- A therapist's openness about assessment and treatment plan establishes a cooperative system (Dimaggio et al., 2007)
- Transparency about changes in symptoms and need for altering therapeutic course is essential for ongoing collaboration
- Written treatment contract can concretize and make explicit the collaborative foundation of treatment
- Summarizing treatment sessions in writing helps foster a cooperative, collaborative state of mind in the patient (Dimaggio et al., 2007)

**Mutual Understanding and Building a Secure Base**

- Collaboration is built upon mutual understanding (Liotti, 2005)
- Mutual understanding fosters a foundation for building a secure base within the treatment relationship
- Cooperative motives involve feelings of safety and sharing, leading to pleasure and relationship building (Liotti & Gilbert, 2011)

**Managing Intense Shifts in BPD and DD Patients with Parallel Coordinated Treatments**

- Combination of individual and group treatments, and two primary individual therapists can support the development of mentalizing capacity
- Second therapist can validate and explore ruptures with the first therapist, promoting metacognitive reflection (Liotti et al., 2008)
- Reduces emotional strain on therapeutic relationship and increases security for both therapist and patient

**Cognitive Evolutionary Therapy (CET)**

- Developed by Liotti for treating personality disorders, dissociative disorders, and attachment disturbances
- Key goals include helping patients reflect more skillfully on interactions and reaching a cooperative stance (Prunetti et al., 2013)
- Inpatient version of CET is a 20-hour-per-week, three-week-long approach to therapy

**Beyond Mentalizing: Mindfulness and Transcendence of Self**

- David Wallin extends mentalizing into the domain of mindfulness (Wallin, 2007)
- Starting point for suggested therapy is implicit, nonverbal experience
- Therapist helps patients develop awareness of their emotional experiences to build a secure attachment and promote growth.

**Early Relationships and Internal Representations**

- Our first relational experiences are mainly nonverbal and unconsciously internalized as representations, rules, and models.
- These hard-to-reach representations cannot be linguistically retrieved and must be accessed experientially.
- Wallin refers to this nonverbal domain of implicit knowledge as the "unthought known."

**Communicating Nonverbal Representations in Therapy**

- Patients communicate these nonverbal states through other-than-verbal channels.
- Enactment, evocation, and embodiment are primary means of communication.

**Secure Base and Collaborative Communication**

- Wallin's crucible for transformation is the provision of a secure base by the therapist.
- **Secure base is promoted by collaborative communication**:
  * Inclusive dialogue of all domains of experience
  * Identifying and repairing ruptures
  * Upgrading dialogue to higher levels of awareness
  * Providing a real relationship

**Engaging Ongoing Experience in Insecurely Attached Patients**

- **Three stages of engaging ongoing experience**:
  1. **Embeddedness**: patient deeply embedded in vicissitudes of ongoing experience, much implicit.
  2. **Mentalizing**: patient reflects on mental states rather than simply experiencing them.
  3. **Mindfulness**: directing awareness to moment-by-moment process of experiencing.

**Moving from Mentalizing to Mindfulness**

- **Difference between mentalizing and mindfulness**:
  * **Mentalizing**: making sense of contents of experience
  * **Mindfulness**: being fully present to experience
- Through mindfulness practice, there is a transition from mentalizing focus to identification with awareness itself.
- Emergence of transcendence of self to a larger vision.

### A Consensus-Based Model for Attachment Treatment
Mallinckrodt and associates developed an attachment approach to adult psychotherapy based on consensus from experts in the field. The model is based on the agreement that adult attachment theory provides a useful framework for treating maladaptive patterns of attachment in adults with significant relational problems.

**Key Concepts**:
- Adult attachment theory offers a useful framework for treating maladaptive attachment patterns in adults with relationship issues.
- The attachment system is activated when adults perceive a threat, and patients will seek comfort and emotional proximity with an attachment figure.
- **Two main types of problematic attachment problems in adults**: deactivating and hyperactivating strategies.

**Problematic Attachment Problems**:

* **Deactivating Strategies**:
  - Inflated self-esteem
  - Suppress attachment-related thoughts and feelings
  - Avoidant attachment
  - Reduced physiological arousal
  - Project unwanted self-traits onto others
  - Alexithymia regarding distress
* **Hyperactivating Strategies**:
  - Negative beliefs about coping with distress
  - Expect inconsistent responsiveness and availability from others
  - Anxious attachment
  - Exaggerated appraisal of perceived threats
  - Fears of abandonment
  - Unable to suppress painful thoughts of separation
  - More alert to self-perceived weakness

**Attachment-Based Treatment**:

The treatment is divided into three phases: engagement, working, and termination.

**Engagement Phase**:
1. Establishing a secure therapeutic relationship as a safe base for exploration.
2. Joining with the patient to promote safety and engagement.
3. Regulating closeness and distance in the therapeutic relationship based on attachment style.
4. Encouraging patients with deactivating strategies to focus on their longing for connection.
5. Patient-therapist match should be complementary in terms of attachment style.
6. **Signs of successful engagement**: client makes a commitment to change, reports behavioral change outside sessions, develops tolerance for deeper and more intense affect in sessions, and shows capacity to "do the work" of therapy.

**Working Phase**:
- Focus on resolving attachment injuries and developing new ways of relating.

**Termination Phase**:
- Preparing for ending the therapeutic relationship and maintaining gains made during treatment.

**Comprehension of the Working Phase in Attachment Treatment**

The primary objective of the working phase in attachment treatment is to establish a secure attachment between clients and therapists, enabling them to meet their needs through security-based strategies instead of relying on hyperactivating or deactivating strategies for affect regulation and interpersonal needs. This process is referred to as the "corrective emotional experience."

- **Hyperactivated Patients**:
  - **Goal**: Reduce the need for reassurance from others
  - **Outcome**: Shift from insecure to secure attachment style
- **Deactivated Patients**:
  - **Goal**: Reduce tendency to cut off emotional experiences
  - **Outcome**: Shift from insecure to secure attachment style

**Desired Outcome**:

- Significant shift from insecure to secure attachment style over the course of therapy
- Rely more on security-based strategies for affect regulation
- Develop effective social competencies for forming satisfying attachments with others

**Termination Phase and Challenges**:

- Major separation, reactivation of old dysfunctional attachment behaviors is expected during termination
- Therapists should be aware of any reemergence of hyperactivating and deactivating strategies

**Consensus Model of Treatment**:

- Useful integration of principles from various attachment treatment models
- Valuable contributions from intersubjective and metacognitive fields not explicitly included

**Three Pillars of Attachment Treatment**:

- Detailed description of the underlying principles and overall framework in the following chapters
- Combination of published material, clinical experience, and efficient methods for attachment repair

## Chapter 7 Introduction to the Three Pillars of Comprehensive Attachment Treatment

**Relational Disturbance**

- Approximately half of mental health seekers present with issues not related to depression or anxiety disorders.
- Indications of relational disturbance, affecting relationships and sense of self.
- Understanding relational disturbance is crucial due to its significant impact on psychotherapy entry reasons.

**Three Types of Relational Disturbance**

1. **Attachment Disturbance**:
   - Develops between 12-20 months, forming internal working models and attachment patterns.
   - **Four main types**: secure, ambivalent/resistant, avoidant, disorganized.
   - Behavioral memory system (observed behavior imitation) operative during this period.
   - Attachment disturbance in adults expressed primarily as reenactments in relationships and transference.
   - Interpretation of transference reenactments may not lead to insight due to the developmental timing of memory systems.
2. **Core Conflictual Relationship Theme (CCRT)**:
   - Develops between the third and fourth year of life.
   - Characterized by the maturation of narrative memory, complex emotional ideas, stable beliefs, schemas, wishes, needs, fantasies, and defenses.
   - A second layer of relational representation independent of attachment representation.
3. **Object Relations**:
   - Develops during late childhood and adolescence.
   - Involves the development of a sense of self and others as distinct entities with internal thoughts, feelings, and motivations.
   - Object relations are internalized representations of significant relationships from the past that shape current interactions.

**Developmental Timeline**:

- **Behavioral memory system**: present in rudimentary form at birth, reasonably well developed by nine months.
- **Narrative memory system**: begins to develop between 18 and 24 months, not fully developed until the beginning of the fourth year.
- **Attachment representation**: stably established by the end of the second year.
- **CCRT**: emerges during the third and fourth year.
- **Object relations**: develops during late childhood and adolescence.

**The Circle of Relationships Theory (CCRT)**

- The CCRT is a pattern of relational expectations and experiences based on past and present relationships (relationship episodes, RE)
- Consists of wishes, needs, and intentions (W) of the individual, responses from others (RO), and responses from self (RS)
- More complex and diverse than attachment maps and forms by age five due to development during childhood when narrative memory is functioning
- Identification and conscious recognition of dysfunctional CCRT patterns can contribute to diminishing their effect on relational functioning

**CCRT Formulation Example**:

- You go into relationships wanting to be appreciated for who you are (W)
- Others commonly respond by never satisfying your needs (RO)
- Resulting response from self is feeling not seen, discouraged, and depressed (RS)

**Prevalence of Problematic CCRTs**:

- Between 30% and 40% of American adults have insecure attachment
- Many with secure attachment also show evidence of problematic CCRTs or trauma bonding

**Trauma Bonding**:

- Occurs in relationships characterized by significant power differential and intermittent experiences of fright and caring behavior
- Can occur in childhood or adulthood, reactivating early attachment disturbance or acquired in adulthood
- Shows a pattern of relational disturbance similar to fearful (disorganized) or anxious-preoccupied attachment

**Determining Underlying Causes of Relational Disturbance**:

- Assessing attachment type using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) or other measures
- Collecting a history of relational episodes to develop a CCRT formulation
- Determining presence of trauma bonding when abuse is evident in the history
- Deciding together whether relational disturbance is related primarily to attachment, CCRT, or trauma

**Treatment Approach**:

- **Secure attachment with problematic CCRTs or trauma bonding**: focus on latter issues
- **Significant insecure attachment of one type or another and/or problematic CCRTs or trauma bonding**: initially address attachment patterns
- **Mild-to-moderate anxious or dismissing attachment with CCRT conflict or trauma bonding**: clinical judgment needed to determine treatment approach based on interference with relationships

**Resources for Treatment**:

- Luborsky, 1984; Strupp and Binder, 1984; Luborsky and Critt-Christoph, 1998; Book, 1998 (CCRT treatment)
- J. G. Allen, 2001; Hassan, 2000, 2009; Landenburger, 1989; van der Kolk, 1989 (Trauma bonding treatment)

### Treating Attachment Disturbance: The Three Pillars

This method has evolved over the last 20 years and consists of three components: (1) Ideal Parent Figure protocol, (2) fostering metacognitive skills, and (3) promoting collaborative behavior in treatment.

**The First Pillar: The Ideal Parent Figure Protocol**

**Background and Core Assumptions**:
- Attachment research suggests that attachment representations and internal working models develop between 12 to 20 months of age.
- Representation of attachment, not attachment behavior itself, is the focus for treatment intervention.
- Mental imagery contributes directly to the development of new, positive internal representations and a healthy internal working model of secure attachment.
- Techniques designed to reduce negative states of mind do not create positive ones; direct introduction of positive attachment imagery is necessary.
- Emphasizing therapist's role as a secure base or limited reparenting figure is problematic due to time constraints and developmental inconsistency.

**Utilizing the Ideal Parent Figure Protocol**:
- Focuses on developing new, positive internal representations through mental imagery.
- Assumes that utilizing this medium contributes directly and efficiently to the development of a new, healthy internal working model of secure attachment.

**The Second Pillar: Fostering Metacognitive Skills**

* Addresses limitations in metacognitive capacity
* Helps patients understand their thoughts and emotions related to attachment

**The Third Pillar: Promoting Collaborative Behavior in the Treatment Relationship**

* Encourages nonverbal and verbal collaboration between patient and therapist
* Enhances therapeutic alliance and treatment effectiveness

**Mutually Enhancing Interrelationship of the Three Pillars**

* Each pillar benefits its particular domain of focus
* The application of each one reinforces and enhances the others

### The Five Primary Conditions That Promote Secure Attachment

Attachment security can be promoted by addressing and strengthening the following five developmental experiences for patients with significant attachment disturbance:

1. **A Sense of Felt Safety**:
   - **Child experience**: Consistent and reliable protection from danger and threat.
   - **Parental behavior**: Parents' provision of safety and security.
   - **Benefits**: Emotion regulation, soothing, and reassurance.

2. **A Sense of Being Seen and Known**:
   - **Child experience**: Consistent, reliable, and accurate attunement to the child.
   - **Parental behavior**: Parents' responsiveness and understanding of the child's needs and emotions.
   - **Benefits**: Self-esteem, metacognitive development, and emotional intelligence.

3. **The Experience of Felt Comfort**:
   - **Child experience**: Consistent, reliable, and timely soothing and reassurance.
   - **Parental behavior**: Parents' provision of comfort and support in times of distress.
   - **Benefits**: Emotion regulation, stress reduction, and increased feelings of security.

4. **A Sense of Being Valued**:
   - **Child experience**: Consistent, reliable, and clear expressed delight in the child.
   - **Parental behavior**: Parents' positive regard and appreciation for the child.
   - **Benefits**: Self-esteem, self-worth, and motivation to explore and learn.

5. **A Sense of Support for Being and Becoming One’s Unique, Best Self**:
   - **Child experience**: Consistent, reliable, unconditional support and encouragement for exploration.
   - **Parental behavior**: Parents' acceptance and validation of the child's individuality.
   - **Benefits**: Self-development, metacognitive development, and increased self-awareness.

**Consistency and Reliability**:
These are common factors that contribute to all categories of parental behavior. They include parents' presence, interest, and responsiveness. Consistent and reliable behaviors help children develop a sense of trust and security in their relationships with caregivers.

**Benefits of Secure Attachment**:
When these primary conditions are met, beneficial effects can occur in several key self-functioning capacities:

- **Emotion regulation**: Soothing and reassurance from felt safety and comfort.
- **Self-esteem and metacognitive development**: From being seen and known and being valued.
- **Self-development and metacognitive development**: From attunement and support for exploration.

### 1. Felt Safety/Protection

**Felt Safety and Protection**

- According to Bowlby (1969/1982), the primary function of attachment in both animals and humans is for protection of the species.
  * Fawn stays close to doe for protection from predators.
  * Human infants experience maternal protectiveness as a sense of safety in the world and relationship with mother.
- **Failure of protection in family systems can lead to devastating consequences**:
  * Processing and integrating memories and feelings related to abuse is challenging.
  * Processing and integrating memories and feelings related to nonoffending parents' failure to protect is often harder due to the fundamental need for protection.
- **Parental protectiveness does not always manifest effectively**:
  * Secure base not present can lead to larger protection failures and insecure attachment patterns.
- **In therapy, using IPF protocol to foster attachment repair and promote experience of protection and secure base**:
  * Therapist introduces parent figures who are deeply protective of the child.
  * Parent figures take all means to keep child from harm.
  * When harm or abuse has occurred, they are deeply responsive to child's state of mind and needs for wellbeing.
  * Ideal parent figures represent positive opposite of parents with protection failures.

### 2. Feeling Seen and Known/Attunement

**Attunement and Secure Attachment**

- **Attuned parents are actively engaged with their child's**:
  - Immediate behavior
  - Inner state of mind
  - Developmental range

**Aspects of Attunement**

_Behavior:_
- Immediately responsive
- Contingently matching behavior
- Changing in response to behavior

_Inner State:_
- Giving voice to child's emotions, needs, motivations, and ideas

_Developmental Range:_
- Working within developmental range
- Introducing challenges for optimal development

**Effects of Attunement**

- Helps child find "right skill-to-challenge ratio"
- Promotes optimal functioning and development
- Induces state of "being in the flow"

**Examples of Attunement**

_Potty Training:_
- Developmentally attuned parents understand child's developmental readiness
- Contingently responsive and helpful
- Avoid power struggles, humiliation, or personal failure experiences

**Impact of Nonattunement**

- Limiting to formation of secure attachment maps in developing child

**Attachment Repair for Adults**

- Imagined ideal parent figures embodying qualities of attunement and contingent responsiveness
- Incorporating experience of consistent attunement into positive map of secure attachment

### 3. Felt Comfort/Soothing and Reassurance 

**Felt Comfort and Soothing**

- Contributes to the emergence of internal affect regulation (Marian Tolpin, 1971)
- Results from the cumulative internalization of repeated soothing and comforting behavior by the parent
- **Parent's responsiveness during emotional upset**: physical comfort, emotional soothing, verbal reassurance
- Child experiences "felt comfort"
- Repeated experience leads to internal representation of soothing response
- Development of internal structures for affect regulation

**Impact on Insecure Attachment**

- Adult patients with insecure attachment show clinically significant affect-regulation deficits
- Emotion-regulation repair and development through ideal parent figures (IPF)
- IPF provide physical comfort, emotional soothing, and verbal reassurance
- Highly specific and individualized imagery
- **Affect-regulatory goal**: incorporation into the newly developing positive map of secure attachment as soothing-related representations.

### 4. Feeling Valued/Expressed Delight 

**Self-Esteem Development and Expressed Delight**

* Self-esteem defined as linking positive affect states to self-representation (Sander, 1975)
* Narcissistically vulnerable adults failed to link positive affect states directly to their self-representation during childhood
* Healthy self-esteem emerges when a child feels valued and valuable, experienced through parents' consistent expressions of delight
* **Kohut (1971)**: every child needs reinforcement of being seen as "the gleam in the mother's eye" for self-value and self-affirmation
* Parents who raise children with healthy self-esteem express joy and delight about their child's actions and being
* Repeated expressions of joy and delight by parents serve as a developmental bridge for linking deeply positive emotional states to the child's self-representation
* Modern Western culture parents often focus more on job of parenting than the joy, leading to lack of expressed delight in children's experience

**Imago Relationship Therapy (IPF) and Self-Esteem Development**

* IPF method supports self-esteem development through ideal parent figures
* Ideal parent figures express utter joy or sheer delight about the child's immediate behavior and being in general.

### 5. Felt Support for Best Self/Unconditional Support and Encouragement

**Attachment-Based Imagery for Secure Self-Development**

**Parental Role in Secure Self-Development**

* Parents of secure children facilitate best self-development
* Encourage free play and exploration
* Do not have agendas or need child to conform
* See themselves as co-explorers and supporters
* Encourage uniqueness and difference
* Provide safety, attunement, comfort, and reassurance
* Normal, healthy self-development impaired in patients with anxious-preoccupied or disorganized attachment patterns

**Ideal Parent Figure Imagery (IPF)**

* Encourages exploration and play
* Supports discovery of uniqueness
* Introduced for adult patients with clinically significant self-pathology
* Helps develop positive map of secure attachment

**Attachment-Based Imagery Over the Course of Treatment**

**Early Stages**

* Focus on safety/protection, attunement, comfort, and reassurance
* Encourage exploration with a secure base

**Middle to Late Stages**

* Shift from secure-base-promoting imagery to exploration-in-context-of-secure-base imagery
* Foster development of strong, autonomous sense of self (best self)
* Introduce developmental sequence imagery protocols for self-definition, organization, agency, esteem, in-relation-to-others, and expanded contexts

**Late Stages**

* Introduce imagery of secure intimacy with a partner
* Co-create positive map for future secure relationships

**Goals of Attachment-Based Imagery**

* Foster development of new, unified positive internal working model (IWM) of secure attachment
* Eclipse outdated insecure maps as patient uses new map in everyday life
* Normalize hyperactivated attachment system and bring deactivated attachment system back online.

### THE SECOND PILLAR: FOSTERING A RANGE OF METACOGNITIVE SKILLS

- Research using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) has shown that secure attachment is characterized by high coherence of discourse and underlying coherence of mind.
- Insecurely attached individuals show low coherence on AAI coherence scales, which are strongly correlated with metacognitive capacity.
- Metacognitive capacity refers to the ability to be aware of one's own and others' minds and mental activity as mental processes, and to apply that awareness to various mental operations.
- Individuals who score high on the AAI Metacognitive Processes scale are likely to have a secure attachment pattern.

**Implications and Interventions**

- Peter Fonagy, Anthony Bateman, and others at the London School discovered that fostering metacognitive capacity through specific treatment interventions can contribute to the development of high coherence and earned security in patients with clinically significant attachment disturbance.
- They developed mentalization-based treatment (MBT), an approach based on enhancing metacognitive development.

**Mentalization in Psychotherapy**

- MBT involves recognition and exploration of one's own states of mind and the states of mind of others in the context of psychotherapy.
- Mentalizing is a process of joint awareness where patient and therapist engage in a process of representational redescription, making implicit information explicit knowledge to the mind.
- The therapist should reduce excessive reliance on content and help the patient generate multiple perspectives.

**Fostering Mentalization**

- A therapist needs to maintain a mentalizing stance to help a patient develop a capacity to mentalize.
- **Exploring a mind by a mind**: why is the patient saying or behaving this way? What has happened recently that may justify the current state?
- The cumulative effect of systematic mentalizing efforts in MBT is the development of general metacognitive or reflective capacity in the patient.

**Assessing Reflective Functioning**

- Fonagy and colleagues developed the Reflective Functioning Scale (RF-S) to assess reflective capacity as it manifests in responses to AAI questions and queries.
- Reflective function refers to the psychological processes underlying the capacity to mentalize, and its overall strength is rated on the RF-S between –1 and 9.
- Research using the RF-S shows that MBT significantly contributes to the development of reflective function.

**Development of New Positive Representations**

- Through MBT, a patient becomes more aware of his or her immediate mental state.
- Learns to accurately mark, label, and understand affective states and cognitive states.
- Becomes sensitized to the limitations of knowledge and beliefs.
- Learns to identify states of mind antecedent to behaviors.
- Becomes able to contextualize states of mind.
- Becomes able to mentalize about others' states of mind and about the transference in the therapy.
- Over a long period, frequent and diverse interpretations can enable the patient to create a mental representation of himself or herself and the analyst, forming the basis for new possibilities of separation and intimacy.

**London Group's Findings**

* Mentalization-based methods contribute to reflective capacity, coherence of mind, and earned security.
* Consistent with research linking metacognitive function and coherence of mind to attachment security.
* **Essential component of attachment-based treatment**: developing metacognitive, reflective capacity.

**Limitations of London Approach**

* Assumes reflective capacity is a unitary construct.
* All types of metacognition result from a single reflective function process.

**Research from Rome (Third Center of Cognitive Psychotherapy)**

* Specific metacognitive deficits associated with specific diagnostic conditions.
* Metacognitive mastery, differentiation of internal states and external reality, and capacity to integrate internal states are affected differently in patients with borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder.

**Metacognition Assessment Scale (MAS)**

* Multi-category instrument designed to identify particular metacognitive strengths and deficits in each patient.
* Rome school developed condition-specific treatment approach based on MAS findings.

**Condition-Specific Treatment Approach**

* Identify specific metacognitive deficits presented by patients with particular diagnoses or conditions.
* Consistently support the development of those particular deficient metacognitive abilities, or modules.

**Combining London and Rome Approaches**

* **Both approaches have merit**: general-function and condition-specific.
* Combining both leads to more effective and efficient treatment.

**Assumptions and Methods for Developing Metacognitive Capacity**

* Fostering metacognitive skills in treatment is a main component of overall treatment of adult attachment disturbance.
* **London and Rome approaches have limitations**: they don't integrate research on adult postformal-operational cognitive development.

**Expanded Model of Cognitive Development**

* 12 stages of cognitive development, including formal operational thinking (London approach) and postformal stages.
* Higher-level postformal cognitive development includes the capacity to conceptually grasp and operate on increasingly complex relationships.

**Metacognitive Skills Relevant to Attachment-Based Psychotherapy**

* Strengthen overall mentalizing capacity and skills already present in a patient's functioning.
* Promote the development and operational emergence of skills beyond those present when they came to treatment.

**Three Categories of Metacognitive Skills**

* **Basic**: fundamental metacognitive abilities, such as self-awareness and self-regulation.
* **Intermediate**: metacognitive abilities that support the development of more advanced skills, like perspective-taking and emotional regulation.
* **Advanced**: metacognitive abilities related to higher levels of cognitive development, such as systems thinking and transcending relativism.

**Metacognitive Skills**

_Basic Metacognitive Skills_
- Awareness of the state of mind of self or other
  * Includes emotions, thoughts, and physical sensations
- Monitoring the accuracy of state of mind
  * Checking the validity of thoughts and feelings
- Awareness of one’s own influence on others' states or behavior, and vice versa
- Becoming aware of one’s state of mind in a way that regulates it
- Awareness of one’s own or another’s action plans and goal-directedness
- **Meaning-making**: understanding the significance of experiences

_Intermediate Metacognitive Skills_
- Recognition of how past experiences shape current experiences
  * Understanding how past influences present
- Appreciating the relativity of states of mind
  * Realizing that perspectives can vary
- Seeing beyond surface information to underlying assumptions and expectancies
  * Understanding the context and implications of information
- Optimizing action plans based on accurate awareness of limitations
  * Adjusting strategies based on new information
- Fostering sensitivity to contextual effects on behavior
  * Being aware of how situations influence thoughts, feelings, and actions
- **Perspective-taking**: considering things from another's point of view

_Advanced Metacognitive Skills_
- Taking a wider, supersystemic perspective
  * Understanding the bigger picture and interconnections
- Developing metacognitive awareness of past/present, self/other, or child/adult orientations
  * Recognizing different ways of thinking and being in the world
- Awareness of the degree of organization or coherence of one’s mind
  * Understanding how thoughts, feelings, and actions relate to each other
- Recognition of interdependence
  * Understanding that all things are connected and influence each other
- Articulating ultimate concerns
  * Identifying core values and motivations
- Direct, nonrepresentational awareness of a wider reality
  * Experiencing the world in a more profound way
- Highest-order metacognitive skills such as spacious freedom and wisdom
  * Achieving a deep understanding of reality and the nature of consciousness

**Approach to Treatment**
A fundamental assumption of this approach is that increasing patients' facility with overall mentalizing and a wide range of specific metacognitive skills leads to greater mental health and wellbeing. The treatment aims for earned security and high coherence of discourse and mind on the Attachment Anxiety Inventory (AAI), but also values patients’ advancement to and stabilization of higher levels of adult cognitive development through metacognitively based treatment. Fostering the widest possible range of metacognitive skills is the second pillar of this comprehensive approach to treating attachment disturbance.

### THE THIRD PILLAR: FOSTERING COLLABORATIVE NONVERBAL AND VERBAL BEHAVIOR

The human species is uniquely cooperative and collaborative in three respects: cooperative shared behavior, nonverbal communication, and verbal communication (Gilbert, 1989; Tomasello, 2009). This collaborativeness is evident even in infants' interactions with caregivers (Beebe & Lachmann, 2014; Tomasello, 2010). However, infants in insecure attachment systems may deactivate their natural tendencies toward collaborativeness due to caregiving inadequacies.

**Collaborative Behavior in Secure Attachment**:

- Infants in secure attachment systems exhibit collaborative behavior, nonverbal and verbal, as a natural expression of healthy development (Beebe & Lachmann, 2014; Tomasello, 2010).

**Collaborative Behavior in Insecure Attachment**:

- Infants in insecure attachment systems may deactivate collaborativeness due to caregiving inadequacies such as unresponsiveness, inconsistency, overinvolvement, rejection, mismatches to contingent behaviors, and frightening or frightened behaviors (Bowlby, 1969).
- Deactivation of collaborativeness can lead to negative consequences, including personality and dissociative disorders or psychotic disorders.

**Fostering Collaborative Behavior in Attachment-Based Therapy**:

- Promoting a collaborative partnership is the third pillar of attachment-based treatment (Liotti, 2005).
- The therapist takes a consistent stance that psychotherapy is a mutually regulated process of collaboration.

**Behavioral Collaborativeness**:

- At the onset of treatment, the therapist helps the patient establish a collaboratively agreed-upon treatment frame (clear understanding of expectations).
- The therapist confronts any behavior that goes against the treatment frame and directly acknowledges their own ruptures to maintain shared responsibility.

**Nonverbal Collaborativeness**:

- Insecure patients with personality disorders or severe disturbances may have limited collaborative nonverbal behavior.
- The therapist observes and identifies patterns of mismatching and poor nonverbal communication, striving to increase matching and verbalizing the patient's impaired patterns.

**Verbal Collaborativeness**:

- Poor verbal collaborativeness in adults with insecure attachment often manifests through deviations from Grice's maxims of coherent, cooperative discourse (Grice, 1975).
- The therapist points out patterns of noncollaborative verbal behavior and explores their antecedent states of mind to help the patient develop better metacognitive awareness.

**Overall Outcome**:

- More consistently collaborative dialogue based on coherent, cooperative verbal expression throughout treatment.
- Enhancement of collaborative verbalization capacity and behavior outside of therapy.

### The Interdependence of the Three Pillars of Treatment
Three dimensions of treatment: attachment, metacognitive development, and collaborativeness.

**Attachment Imagery Promotes Metacognitive Development**:

- Engaging with ideal parent figure imagery promotes metacognitive awareness.
- Patient represents healthy attachment, builds metacognitive awareness, and experiences metacognitive mastery.

**Metacognitive Development Promotes Attachment**:

- Patients learn to be aware of their states of mind and attachment patterns in therapy relationship.
- Therapist models metacognitions about the therapy relationship, providing windows into their own state of mind.
- Metacognitively focused elements support accurate internal representations of therapist and attachment figures.

**Collaborativeness Promotes Metacognitive Development**:

- **Collaborative goal**: developing metacognitive skills.
- Therapist's emphasis on collaboration contributes to patient's metacognitive understanding of multiple perspectives.

**Metacognitive Development Promotes Collaborativeness**:

- Therapist calls attention to noncollaborative behaviors, promoting metacognitive awareness and collaborative behavior.
- Patient becomes more aware of treatment-frame expectations and maintains collaboration.

**Collaborativeness Promotes Attachment**:

- Mutually respectful, collaborative relationship promotes positive, healthy Internal Working Model (IWM) or attachment map.
- Collaborative therapy relationship and ideal parent figures in imagery promote positive attachment representations.

**Attachment Imagery Promotes Collaborativeness**:

- Patients develop positive attachment imagery through Ideal Parent Figure protocol.
- Repeated cycles of recognition, matching, and effective responses build collaborative experiences.

**Interdependence of the Three Systems**:

- Attachment system, metacognitive development, and collaborativeness are interdependent in treatment.
- Engaging with each system activates and strengthens the other two systems.

### The Benefits of Three Pillars Treatment

1. **Repeated engagement with ideal parent figure imagery**:
   - Patients learn to visualize and interact with an idealized parent figure, helping them develop a secure attachment style.

2. **Promoting a wide range of metacognitive skills**:
   - Patients are taught various metacognitive strategies to help them understand their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

3. **Fostering behavioral, nonverbal, and verbal collaborativeness**:
   - Patients learn to communicate effectively and work cooperatively with others, promoting healthy relationships and emotional intelligence.

## Chapter 8: The First Pillar

**The Ideal Parent Figure (IPF) Protocol**
- A therapeutic method for developing a positive, stable inner working model of attachment relationships
- Facilitates the development of secure attachment representations through imagery of positive attachment figures and secure experiences
- Establishes a new internal model of secure attachment through repetition and elaboration

**Overview of IPF Method**
1. Familiarity with the tool
2. Recognizing unique patient patterns and needs
3. Understanding caretaking qualities that promote secure attachment
4. Patient's relationship with imagined attachment figures is primary agent of change
5. Applied in therapeutic relationship context
6. Therapist embodies qualities that promote secure attachment

**Qualities that Promote Secure Attachment**
- Physical presence, reliability, consistency, and interest in the patient (general factors)
- Protection when at risk
- Accurate attunement to behavior, state, and developmental level
- Soothing and reassuring
- Expressing delight or positive regard
- Support for inner and outer exploration

**Therapist's Role during IPF Protocol**
1. Present, reliable, consistent, and interested in patient's experience
2. Protective when necessary
3. Attuned to moment-to-moment experience
4. Soothing and reassuring
5. Expresses delight in positive experiences with imagined attachment figures
6. Embodies support for inner and outer exploration

**IPF Method vs Traditional Attachment-Based Treatments**
- Primary change agent is patient's relationship with imagined attachment figures
- Applied in therapeutic relationship context
- Therapist embodies qualities that promote secure attachment to enhance effectiveness

**Strengths of IPF Method**
- Builds upon relational foundation by incorporating attachment-promoting qualities into content of work
- Therapist recognizes, mirrors, and enhances qualities that promote secure attachment in patient's imagery
- No preestablished scripts; effective when therapist understands underlying principles and responds freshly to each patient.

### The Foundational Protocol
**The IPF Protocol: Setting the Therapeutic Ground**

The IPF (Ideal Parent Figure) protocol begins with helping the patient establish a calm, relaxed, inwardly focused state of awareness. This state increases the likelihood of vivid imagery and decreases distractions. The focus is ideally on the body, enhancing engagement with immediate bodily experience to form new attachment representations during the critical period of attachment formation (12-20 months).

**Establishing a Calm, Relaxed State**:

1. Settle comfortably into a chair and let the body adjust for support.
2. Bring attention to the felt sense of the body and let go of any effort to support it.
3. **Deepen the inwardly focused state using Charcot's method**:
   - **Inhale**: Open eyes fully
   - **Exhale**: Close eyes gently
   - Focus on sensations and feelings of eye movements and breath
4. Enhance focus on calming and relaxation during exhalations.
5. Let the eyes remain closed when it feels natural to do so.
6. Perform a brief body scan to find the most comfortable, relaxed area in the body.

**Preparing the Patient**:

- Anxious-preoccupied patients and agitated or distracted patients may require additional guidance toward self-focused, relaxed body awareness.
- Highly dissociative patients (e.g., DID) may enter the preparatory state with little prompting.
- Therapists can deepen the ground state using hypnotic methods if trained in hypnosis.

**Deepening the Inwardly Focused State**:

1. Open eyes fully on inhalation and close them gently on exhalation.
2. Give close attention to sensations and feelings of eye movements and breath.
3. Enhance focus on calming, relaxing, and letting go during exhalations.
4. Let the eyes remain closed when it feels natural to do so.
5. Become more aware of the calming, relaxing feeling spreading throughout the body.
6. Perform a brief body scan to find the most comfortable, relaxed area in the body.

**Important Notes**:

- The above method is an illustration of how a patient might be prepared for subsequent ideal parent figure imagery.
- Therapists are free to choose methods that best serve a particular patient based on their understanding of the preparatory phase principles.

### FACILITATING THE CREATION OF IDEAL PARENT FIGURE IMAGERY
The goal is to help patients form new, healthy attachments by engaging them in self-generated imagery of being a child with positive attachment figures. The therapist sets up conditions to evoke such imagery and uses consistent phrasing for the initial framing.

1. **Evoke experience of a child-self state**:
   - Patients are asked to imagine themselves as young children, feeling themselves in that state.
   - Indication of child experience is valuable and highlights the experience for the patient.

2. **Prompt for ideal parent figure imagery**:
   - Patients are invited to create ideal parents who are not their actual parents but suited to them.
   - These parents have qualities that help patients feel safe and secure in relationship with them.
   - Using "imagine" instead of "visualize" allows incorporation from all sense modalities.

3. **Inquire about the patient's imagery**:
   - Patients describe their experience of the ideal parents and their ways of being.
   - This inquiry provides information about the patient's experience and whether modifications are needed.

4. **Assess adequacy of parent figure imagery**:
   - **Ideal initial imagery**: multisensory experience of two parent figures who are not known to the patient, behaving in attachment-promoting ways.
   - **Adequate initial imagery**: at least one parent figure present through some sensory modality and absence of harmful behaviors.
   - Severe attachment disorders may require additional prompting or correction for adequate imagery.

5. **Common challenges**:
   - If no parent figures are imagined, more focus is placed on evoking the imagery.
   - If patients indicate actual parents or harmful ways of being, guidance is provided to let go and create fictional ideal parents.

6. **Working assumption**:
   - Every patient will eventually create personalized imagery of parent figures promoting secure attachment.
   - The therapeutic frame and IPF method activate the attachment system, leading to spontaneous positive attachment imagery.

### CLINICAL VIGNETTES

**Introduction**:

- Clinical vignettes from IPF (Ideal Parent Figure) sessions with patients illustrating adequate or better ideal parent figure imagery.
- Therapist's role is to support and enhance positive remapping process by focusing on parents' ways of being.

**First Vignette**:

**Patient**: experiences kind, attentive imagined parents.
**Therapist**: reinforces focus on parents' ways of being: close by, looking at patient, fully present, seeing uniqueness, taking seriously, wanting to be best possible parents.
**Patient**: responds with hugging and fun activities, feeling calm and secure.

Patient had disorganized attachment and unresolved trauma. Importance of focusing on parents' ways of being rather than actions for attachment security. Patient felt security from imagined parents' presence and responsiveness.

**Second Vignette**:

**Patient**: describes caring, nurturing mother and energetic father.
**Therapist**: reinforces focus on parents' qualities: affectionate, interested in patient's experience, happy to be with patient.
**Patient**: experiences happiness, energy, and feeling supported.

Therapist emphasizes the importance of focusing on parents' caring and nurturing behaviors as qualities rather than specific actions. Patient's positive feelings are anchored in her body, increasing the likelihood of forming new attachment representations.

**Common Themes**:

- Focus on parents' ways of being (protection, attunement, soothing, expressed delight, support for self-development) rather than specific actions.
- Reinforcing focus on positive inner states and feelings resulting from imagined parents' presence and behaviors.
- Encouraging patients to notice and describe the qualities that make them feel cared for and loved by their imagined parents.

**Attachment-Based Therapy: Parent Figure Imagery (IPF)**

**Focus on Parental Ways of Being**

* Therapist orients patient's focus to parent figures' ways of being rather than their actions
* **Instrumental love**: parents' caretaking behaviors are validated but the more important quality is the way they "be" towards the patient

**Example of Validating Instrumental Love**

Patient Report:
- Parents help with cleaning and making food

Therapist Response:
- Acknowledges parental actions and their positive intentions
- Refocuses attention to the quality of being towards the patient

**Establishing Ideal Parent Figure Imagery (IPF)**

* Patients with insecure attachment may find it challenging to establish clear IPF imagery
* **Therapist's role**: provide support and shape imagery towards secure attachment

First Session:

Patient Report:
- Struggling to create ideal parents
- Initial imagery focuses on parental actions and preferences

Therapist Response:
1. Affirms patient's ability to create the imagery
2. Explicitly points to patient's deep knowledge of what they need for security and love
3. Shapes imagery towards parental interest in and attunement to the child
4. Emphasizes parental cherishing, interest, and attunement
5. Validates reassuring qualities reported by the patient

**Benefits of Shaping IPF Imagery**

* Promotes secure attachment by focusing on beneficial qualities
* Counteracts problematic qualities in actual parents
* Encourages hopefulness and security in the patient

**Principles and Practices for Framing and Responding to Patients' Experiences in Ideal Parent Figure (IPF) Sessions**

**General Guiding Principles**

- Therapist acknowledges patient's current state of mind and mirrors positive states.
- Recognition of the patient's experience by the therapist.
- Validation of the primacy of the patient's own experience and learning over time.
- Shaping imagery to convey qualities of protection, attunement, and acceptance.
- Confidence in and gentle push toward realizing developmental potential.

**Interaction between Patient and Therapist**

1. **Patient expresses lack of security**: The patient indicated that she did not feel a sense of security and expressed doubt about trusting the therapist or ideal parent figures.
2. **Therapist acknowledges patient's experience**: The therapist recognized the patient's experience of doubt and incorporated it into the imagery process by indicating that the parent figures were attuned to her internal state.
3. **Validation and acceptance**: Beyond recognition, the therapist shaped the imagery such that the parent figures were accepting of and patient with both the patient's current experience and her process of development.
4. **Direct statement of protective qualities**: The therapist stated directly the qualities of protection and attunement to help the patient experience a sense of security.
5. **Validation of patient's own experience**: The therapist validated the primacy of the patient's own experience, allowing her to assert her experience against the therapist's suggestion as an important self-validation.

**Variability in Patients' Responses**

- Wide variability in how patients respond to IPF sessions due to attachment insecurity.
- Some patients may have vivid and detailed imagery, while others may imagine harmful or no parent figures.
- Therapists should keep principles of the protocol in mind to effectively work with any patient engagement.

### GENERAL CONTEXT PRINCIPLES

**General Context and Principles**

- The IPF method's fundamental agent of change is the patient's active engagement with ideal parent figure imagery.
- A therapist's way of being with the patient, embodying qualities of good attachment figures, facilitates the imagery work and supports attachment repair through the therapy relationship.
- **The therapist embodies general factors**: physical presence, consistency, reliability, and interest in the patient.
- **The therapist's engagement with facilitating and guiding the IPF process promotes secure attachment through five behavioral pillars**: soothing, reassurance, attunement, expressed delight, and support for exploration.

**Establishing a Calm State and Reassurance**

- Helping the patient establish a calm, relaxed state of awareness is essential for the protocol.
- Effective response to discomfort during the protocol provides an experience of soothing.
- Communicating that everything that arises is welcomed as part of the process reassures the patient.

**Attunement and Interest**

- Being attentive to the patient's moment-to-moment experience and responding in ways that develop and maintain the experience of IPFs indicates therapist attunement.
- Attunement reinforces itself and engages the therapist's interest, communicated through frequent questions about the patient's experiences.

**Qualities of Ideal Parent Figures**

- The therapist asks patients to imagine parents who are ideally suited to them and their nature.
- Patients access their unique needs for attachment security by not hearing specific qualities named initially.
- The patient's parent figures have a foundation in the qualities that come from the patient's deepest knowing of what was most missing during childhood.

### SHAPE THE PATIENT’S IMAGERY AND EXPERIENCE

**Attachment-Focused Imagery Rehabilitation Protocol**

* **Therapist shapes patient's imagery and experience towards attachment security by**:
  * Pointing attention to attachment-promoting qualities of imagined parent figures
  * Mirroring and enhancing descriptions of these qualities

**Pointing Attention to Attachment-Promoting Qualities**

* Therapist encourages patient to focus on ways imagined parent figures promote attachment security
* **Statements like**: "Notice the ways they're being with you..." help keep patient focused
* Reinforces creative and generative aspect of process, encouraging curiosity and openness

**Mirroring and Enhancing Patient's Descriptions**

* Therapist listens carefully to patient's descriptions
* Uses patient's words and phrases to reinforce imagery and build confidence
* Mirroring helps keep attention on beneficial qualities of parent figures
* **Example responses**:
  * "Yes, they really want to be with you..."
  * "These parents enjoy when you’re creative..."
  * "Really feel that deep presence, that warm, gentle, firm holding."

**Effective Mirroring**

* Simple and direct validation mirrors patient's experience and engagement
* Therapist can mirror sensory modalities in patient's descriptions (e.g., tone of voice, look in eyes)
* Marked expressivity (affectively expressive tone) adds to power of imagery and reproduces beneficial developmental circumstance of caregiver attuning to child's experiences

### SUGGEST ATTACHMENT-PROMOTING QUALITIES IN THE IMAGINED PARENT FIGURES

* Therapist does not solely rely on patient's imagination for attachment-promoting qualities in parent figures
* Sets imagery frame for maximal creative freedom
* Mirrors and enhances generated qualities, suggests new ones
* Corrects focus on doing by highlighting underlying attachment-promoting qualities
* Introduces qualities based on secure attachment principles
* Introduces positive opposites of problematic experiences

**Correcting Instrumental Caretaking**

* Patients may describe parent figures engaging in instrumental actions, but these actions don't necessarily promote attachment security
* Therapist mirrors actions and suggests underlying attachment-promoting qualities
* Acknowledges action and patient's perception of parent figure's affective state
* Suggests specific attachment-promoting qualities (e.g., interest, caring, love)

**Examples of Mirroring and Suggesting Attachment-Promoting Qualities**

_Example 1:_

* **Patient**: We're in the kitchen and my mother is making dinner for me. She seems happy.
* **Therapist**: Yes. Notice what it is about her that lets you know how happy she is to be making dinner for you. (Mirroring action)
* **Patient**: She doesn't want to be anywhere other than there with you now, and she’s happy to be making for you what she knows you enjoy so much. (Suggesting attachment-promoting qualities)

_Example 2:_

* **Patient**: My mother is brushing my hair.
* **Therapist**: 
  - And you can feel from her that she's right there with you, soothing you and brushing your hair with such love for you. (Mirroring action)
  - You can really feel her interest, and her caring, and her love through the ways she’s with you, whether she’s doing something for you or just simply being with you. (Suggesting attachment-promoting qualities)

The therapist suggests including these qualities in descriptions of imagined parent figures, even if they are not initially mentioned by the patient. The therapist can draw from the above categories to suggest possibilities for missing qualities. These suggestions should be made in a way that does not impose how the imagined parents will manifest the qualities but instead points the patient's attention towards imagining the ways the qualities will appear in their parent figures.

Additionally, suggested qualities can be based on the opposite of the developmentally disruptive ways of being of the actual parents to effectively counteract those factors and create new attachment representations leading to earned attachment security.

**Obtaining Information about a Patient's Early Experiences with Parents**

* The Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) was developed to obtain information regarding attachment status.
* Ideally, a therapist trained and qualified in administering the AAI conducts it with patients presenting relational disturbance.
* Alternatively, therapists can refer patients to someone qualified to administer the AAI and obtain the transcript and scoring.
* Questions 3 and 4 of the AAI yield five adjectives describing the patient's relationships with their mother and father during early childhood.
* These adjectives reveal indicators of the nature of parental relationships and qualities that likely contributed to attachment insecurity.

**AAI Transcript: Adjectives Describing Parental Relationships**

* **Relationship with Mother**: Anxious, Absent, Not accepting, Frightening, Cold, Irresponsible, Caretaking, Chaotic, Pressured, Playful
* **Relationship with Father**: Anxious, Absent, Not accepting, Frightening, Cold, Irresponsible, Caretaking, Chaotic, Pressured, Playful

**Positive Opposites of Negative Adjectives**

* **Relationship with Mother**: Calm, Present, Accepting, Safe, Never frightening, Warm, Responsive [Attuned caretaking], Clear, Predictable, Relaxed [Attuned playfulness]
* **Relationship with Father**: Calm, Present, Accepting, Safe, Never frightening, Warm, Responsible [Attuned caretaking], Clear, Predictable, Relaxed [Attuned playfulness]

**Explanation of Bracketed Terms**

* **Attuned caretaking**: A positive opposite term for instrumental caretaking that lacks caring and attunement.
* **Attuned playfulness**: A positive opposite term for playful interactions that are not attuned to the child's state.

**IPF Sessions: Statements Made Based on Positive Opposites**

* During IPF sessions, therapists make statements suggesting qualities of imagined parent figures based on positive opposites.
* These statements can be applied as qualities of relationships, feelings towards parents, or qualities of the parents themselves.

**Obtaining Parental Relationship Information Without AAI**

* If an AAI transcript is unavailable, therapists can explore early relationships in detail during initial evaluation.
* Patients are asked to describe their early relationships with parents and caregivers in a narrative way.
* Probing for details helps obtain sufficient information for establishing positive-opposite qualities.

**Single Parent or Caregiver Household**

* If there was only one parent or caregiver, therapists focus on the patient's experience with that person first.
* They then probe for feelings and experiences related to not having the other parent.

**Importance of Obtaining Information for Tailoring Suggestions**

* Any and all sources of information about early relationships are valued in preparing for IPF sessions.
* Therapists integrate information from various sources and formulate positive-opposite qualities for ideal parent figures.

### CONTEXTUALIZE THE PATIENT’S EXPERIENCES WITHIN THE IPF FRAME

**Intro**: In Intensive Psychotherapy for Attachment (IPF), the therapist establishes an imagery frame during a session, which becomes the context for the patient's experiences. The therapist responds to the patient based on the parent figures' responses within this frame.

**Establishing the Imagery Frame**: When a patient expresses fear or resistance, the therapist acknowledges it and allows the parent figures in the imagery to respond beneficially. This enhances the effectiveness of the process by incorporating all experiences into the frame.

**Difficulties with IPF**: Patients may experience various difficulties during the IPF process, which can be addressed within the imagery frame:

1. **Separation or distance from parent figures**: The therapist accepts the patient's experience and encourages the parent figures to help bridge the gap, allowing the patient to choose how to connect.
2. **Decrease in engagement with the imagery frame**: Patients may feel that the parent figures are too perfect or unreal. The therapist acknowledges these feelings and reassures the patient that it's normal and that the parents understand and will continue to support them.

**Separation or distance from parent figures**:

* Patient feels separated by a gauzy, hazy material
  * Therapist gives task to parent figures to help patient connect
  * Parent figures pull aside the material, allowing closer connection
  * Patient experiences feelings of safety and support
* Patient sees parents in different worlds
  * Therapist encourages patient to create ideal parents
  * Patient feels distance but therapist accepts it and encourages closeness
  * Patient eventually experiences full connection with parent figures

**Decrease in engagement with the imagery frame**:

* Patient experiences parent figures as perfect and unreal
  * Therapist acknowledges patient's feelings of disbelief
  * Parent figures reassure patient and take it as a compliment
  * Patient eventually accepts the perfection and feels valued and loved

**Conclusion**: In IPF, the therapist responds to the patient's experiences within the imagery frame, addressing difficulties such as separation or distance from parent figures and decreased engagement with the imagery. The goal is for the patient to experience the parent figures as beneficially responding to their entire range of experiences and states.

**Imaginal Exposure Therapy (IPF) Session**:

**Engagement and Doubt**

* Patient was engaged with the IPF process and experienced positive interactions with parent figures
* Doubt emerged, but patient continued to experience positive affect towards parents
* Patient withdrew from the frame, expressing it as "faking"
* Therapist maintained the presence of the frame by acknowledging patient's doubt and understanding that it was a natural part of the process
* Therapist suggested that parent figures recognized and understood patient's doubt
* Patient reengaged with the imagery, experiencing reassurance from parents

**Reengagement and Guardedness**

* Patient's reengagement was short-lived and he stepped back due to the perfection of the experience
* Therapist pointed back to the frame, acknowledging patient's difficulty in accepting it
* Patient experienced intermittent withdrawal from the IPF frame but was eventually able to maintain a connection
* Patients may express guardedness or uncertainty about parent figures' trustworthiness or reliability
* Therapist validates patient's experience and suggests that parent figures understand and are patient with their hesitance

**Affective States**

* Parental soothing and reassurance during IPF sessions can promote secure attachment
* Therapist watches for signs of affective distress in the patient and suggests that parent figures provide appropriate responses
* Nonverbal indications of a change of state may include facial expressions, tears, body movement, or changes in breathing rate or pattern
* Parent figures find just the right ways to soothe and reassure the patient based on their inner knowing of what is needed
* Patient experiences both therapist's and parent figures' attunement and reassurance within the imagery.

**Examples of Therapist Interventions**:

* "They protect you, and they protect you from yourself sometimes, and this is one of those circumstances in which they help to protect you from doubting too much, from doubting that what you most want and need is here for you."
* "Of course you need to take your time, to see for yourself whether you can really trust them to not make fun of you. They know that too, and they won't push you to open up before you're ready."
* "These parents are so attuned to you, and they see now from the expression on your face that something has shifted in you. They have a sense of exactly what you need right now. Notice how they are with you that provides you with exactly what you need to help you with what's happening in you right now."
* "They tell me that they love me." - Therapist: "Yes, and you can really take that in, that they love you so much, no matter what. Really feel what that’s like as you take that in."

**Patient feels angry and observes the response of her imagined parents (IPF frame)**

* Imagined parents listen to her, take her emotions seriously, don't laugh at her, and stay with her.
* Patient feels respected and cared for by her imagined parents.

**Patient's Childhood Experience**:

* In the past, her actual mother would laugh at her when she was angry or upset about being teased.

**Therapist's Response to Patient's Distress**:

* When patient is unable to respond in IPF frame due to emotional distress, therapist suggests scene change.
* Therapist points out that imagined parents are present, patient and resourceful, and find ways to help the patient.

**Patient's Response to Scene Change**:

* Initially, patient feels that her imagined parents aren't helping.
* Therapist suggests a new scene where patient is still upset but receives comfort from her ideal parents.
* Patient experiences relief and calmness in the new scene.

**Therapist's Actions**:

* Attuned to patient's distress.
* Protects patient from prolonged exposure to emotional pain.
* Soothes patient by suggesting a new scene where she experiences relief.

### SUGGEST CHANGES IN SCENES OR NEW SCENES WITH THE IDEAL PARENT FIGURES

**Benefits of Changing Scenes with Ideal Parent Figures**

* Consolidation of positive attachment experiences
* Generalization across various situations and contexts
* Opportunity to project additional attachment-promoting qualities

**Changes within Scenes**

* Suggesting changes within scenes is best during early IPF sessions
* Open wording leaves creation of specific parental ways of being to the patient
* **Example**: Therapist suggests calm, happy, and fully present parent figures

**Changes of Scenes**

* After several constructive IPF sessions
* Patient given freedom to project qualities onto parent figures in new scene
* **Example**: Therapist suggests warm, easygoing, and trustworthy parent figures

**Timing of Suggesting Scene Changes**

* Done several times before suggesting changes of scenes
* Most obvious time is when patient is having difficulty
* Wait for natural lull in intensity or engagement with process
* Intuition-based recognition of peak benefit
* Not essential in every session if patient continues to be engaged and generative

**Bringing Attention to Experience and Amplifying Positive States**

* Central to IPF method's contribution to attachment repair
* Therapist points patient's attention to experiences of parent figures' attachment-promoting ways of being
* **Example**: Therapist suggests comforting parent figures and brings focus to how it feels to the patient
* Amplification of positive inner states enhances awareness and differentiation of affects
* Facilitates introjection of positive attachment representations
* Consistent with Gergely's research on "marked expressivity" and Fonagy et al.'s concept of "marked affectivity"
* Beneficial for all patients, especially those with anxious-preoccupied attachment.

**Phrasings for Bringing Attention to Felt Experience**

* Therapist can use creative phrasings to draw patient's attention to positive states elicited by attachment-promoting qualities in ideal parent figures.
* **Phrases that direct attention**:
  * How does that feel? (referring to the parent figures)
  * Notice what happens inside you as they...
  * You can feel the effect of...
  * Notice the effect that has on your inner state
  * Feel what that’s like.
  * It's [more relaxed], yes. (patient's term in brackets)
  * You feel that, don't you? (in response to nonverbal indication of effect)
  * That feels good, doesn't it? (in response to nonverbal positive signs)
  * You can say what that’s like inside as they...

**Phrasings for Amplifying Positive States**

* Consistent with Stern's assertion, therapist can use tonal amplification.
* **Phrases that amplify**:
  * Really feel what that’s like.
  * You can feel that [happiness] even more strongly now. (patient's term in brackets)
  * Yes. Really feel that now. Really feel that all through your being.
  * Yes. That feeling of [joy] gets even more clear now.
  * And soon that [sense of safety] becomes even stronger.
  * You might be surprised how vivid and clear that feeling of [calm] becomes.
* Tonally emphasize patient's own words to validate and reinforce states described.

**Integrating Attention-Directing and Experience-Enhancing Phrasings**

* Therapist integrates both attention-directing and experience-enhancing phrasings.
* Emphasis on attention-directing before patient verbalizes positive states.

**Phrasings for Stabilizing and Extending Positive States**

* **When patient experiences positive states in relation to ideal parent figures, therapist can focus on stabilization and extension with phrases like**:
  * Focus on that feeling of [safety]. Really feel it now.
  * As you tune in to that feeling of [safety] more and more, you’re able to hold that feeling more and more continuously in your awareness.
  * More and more continuously in your awareness, that feeling of [safety].
  * Notice what it’s like to begin to hold that feeling of [safety] continuously in your awareness.

**Anchoring Positive States in Body Experience**

* During critical period of attachment formation (12-20 months), identity is primarily body-based and memory is behavioral/enacted rather than mental/narrative.
* More efficient formation of new attachment representations if patient has positive body experience linked to interaction with ideal parent figures.
* **Therapist can bring patient's attention to body experience when using attention-directing phrases**:
  * Notice what that feels like now in the body.
  * And you can be even more aware of that [peaceful] feeling in the body.
  * What’s happening in your body as you’re with these parents now?
  * You can feel the effect of their ways of being with you in your body too.
  * Feel it in your body.
  * The more you feel the [contentment], the more you notice it in your body.
  * You can feel that in your body too, can’t you?

### INTEGRATE METHODS FOR ENHANCING POSITIVE STATES

- Once the patient becomes aware of positive states in relation to parent figures and generates experiential detail, therapist guides integration of all elements.
- **Elements**: amplifying, stabilizing, extending, anchoring positive states in body experience.

**Interaction Example**:

- Patient identifies feeling "comfortable" with parents.
- Therapist guides patient to focus on and become more familiar with the feeling of comfort.
- The more familiar the patient is with this feeling, the more continuously they can feel it.
- Scene changes to help patient feel comfort even more fully in their body.

**Conducting IPF Session**:

- Therapist applies state-enhancing elements throughout session.
- Towards end of session, focus shifts to stabilizing, extending, anchoring positive states.
- Suggest that patient retains good feelings and benefits as scene fades away.
- Create a bridge for smooth transition back to therapy room.

**Ending the IPF Session**:

- Conduct IPF protocol for session duration.
- Towards end of session, focus on stabilizing, extending, anchoring positive states.
- Suggest that patient retains good feelings and benefits as scene fades away.
- Create a bridge for conscious awareness to return fully to therapy room.

**Suggesting Retention of Positive States**:

- About 5 or 10 minutes before end of session, therapist suggests that patient keeps positive feelings and benefits from being with parent figures.

**Creating a Bridge for Smooth Transition**:

- Therapist creates bridge for conscious awareness to return fully to therapy room by gradually counting down from five.

### REORIENT THE PATIENT TO THE PRESENT

**Reorienting the Patient to the Present and Time**

- During Intensive Psychotherapy for Attachment (IPF), it's essential to reorient patients not only to place but also to time.
- Some patients may have vivid experiences of being a child during IPF, which should remain within the process.
- Therapist guides patients back to the present by setting a clear expectation of the end of the session and the continuation of their day.

**Post-Session Interaction**

- Allow patients to speak about their session experience but don't encourage it.
- Address any unpleasant feelings or thoughts that may arise, as they can impact the therapeutic process.
- Normalize the experience and reassure patients about negative experiences.
- Accept the patient's experience without judgment and explain that it is a natural part of the IPF process.

**Signs of Progress in IPF Treatment**

**Engagement with Attachment-Promoting Imagery**

- Patients with deactivated or imbalanced attachment systems may have difficulty engaging with available attachment figures, both in real life and during IPF sessions.
- Indications of progress include reports of being with parent figures who show at least a few essential qualities that promote attachment formation.
  * **For patients with dismissing attachment**: physical presence.
  * **For patients with anxious-preoccupied attachment**: interest in the patient.
- Engagement with ideal parent figure imagery is a sign of progress, indicated by strong clarity and vividness of imagined interactions, close felt connection, and generative responses.

**Beneficial Effects of Positive Attachment Representations**

- As patients become more engaged with attachment-promoting imagery, they begin to experience the beneficial effects of positive attachment representations.
- These benefits include increased feelings of safety, security, and emotional regulation.

**Manifestations of an Internalized Secure Base**

- The ultimate goal of IPF treatment is for patients to develop an internalized secure base, allowing them to function more effectively in relationships and daily life.
- Signs of this development include increased self-soothing abilities, improved emotional regulation, and the ability to form and maintain healthy attachments with others.

### SIGNS OF THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF POSITIVE ATTACHMENT REPRESENTATIONS

The engagement with attachment-promoting imagery is essential for its beneficial effects. The following signs indicate progress as a patient develops toward a stable internal experience of attachment security:

**Emotion Regulation**:
- Patients report decreased feelings of emotional discomfort, agitation, or distress.
- Patients describe the parent figures' behavior as calming and soothing.
- Patients may indirectly modulate the parent figures' behavior to achieve emotional regulation.

**Experience of Safety**:
- Patients feel safe and secure when engaging with attachment imagery.
- Patients report a sense of trust and relaxation.
- Patients describe feeling protected and shielded from external threats.

**Proximity-Seeking**:
- Patients exhibit a desire to be close to the parent figures.
- Patients engage in behaviors that bring them closer to the parent figures.
- Parent figures respond warmly and welcomingly to patients' proximity-seeking behaviors.

**Self-Esteem**:
- Patients feel accepted and loved for who they are.
- Patients no longer feel the need to pretend or perform.
- Patients experience authentic engagement with the world.

**Self-Development**:
- Parent figures foster patients' connections and interests.
- Parent figures encourage patients to learn new skills and explore the world.
- Patients feel valued and supported in their growth and development.

**Examples of Emotion Regulation**:
- "They’re both very calm, even though I’m distressed."
- "It makes me feel less angry. I can just look around, I don’t have to be all pent up with the anger anymore."
- "I think because they’re so calm, as they go on talking, I feel more calm inside, and less agitated."

**Examples of Experience of Safety**:
- "I guess I see myself with my face buried in my mother’s stomach, standing waist high, face against her, her arms wrapped around my back. It feels very safe."
- "My father is standing, and he’s holding me. His arms are underneath me. I’m leaning against him, and my hands are on his shoulder. It feels soothing. I feel safe."

**Examples of Proximity-Seeking**:
- "I notice that I’m hugging them, and they’re responding when I’m hugging them. They’re just playing around and we’re having fun together."
- "We’re outside, on a hike. It’s very invigorating. There’s a sense of energy. I see myself falling behind a step or two, and then scampering to catch up . . . that scampering to catch back up, and be close to them, that driving energy."

**Examples of Self-Esteem**:
- "It means not having to perform. Not having to pretend to be interested longer than I am. And not having to pretend I want to do what perfect kids do. I can do what I want to do. It means that there’s plenty of room for kids to be loved for who they are."
- "It’s kind of like I’m okay, just being me."
- "They want to know what I see. They encourage me to look with my own eyes. The way I see things is the way they’re most interested in. It’s an authentic engagement with the world. I want to say things to the world."

**Examples of Self-Development**:
- "They’re interested in the people I’m interested in. They don’t feel that people are threats to them. They want to foster my own connections."
- "We’re all outside together on a hike. Nice terrain, nice vistas. It’s good to be outside with them, to be connected to nature, to them."
- "Tune into their ways of being with you, that let you know how much they value you."
- "Well, I’m older now, my bike is broken, and we have to fix my bike. They give me all the tools, and they know how to fix the bike, but they know I want to learn. So they show me just enough. They use another bike as a model. They’re not concerned about it being messy. They’re interested in helping me to learn."

**Imaginal Exposure Therapy (IPF): Parent Figure**

- Patients report feeling confident and self-reliant with the presence of imagined parent figures.
  - They encourage and support without forcing.
  - Patients feel stronger and more generous.
  - Sharing themselves is not a loss but something different.

**Effect on Inner State**:

- Patients experience feelings of contentment, being a whole person, and clarity.

**Examples of Patient Experiences**:

1. **Reading with Parent Figures**:
   - Patients report feeling supported while reading and sharing thoughts about stories.
   - Encourages curiosity in the world.
2. **Maternal Figure**:
   - Provides affirmation, making patients feel beautiful and strong.
   - Helps patients understand their emotions and feelings.
3. **Paternal Figure**:
   - Calm and stable presence.
   - Encourages clear communication.

**Beneficial Effects**:

- **Direct experiences**: Patients report feeling safe, content, and whole.
- **Indirect experiences**: Parent figures facilitate the development of qualities or functions in patients.
  - Activation of underlying developmental processes.
  - Continued engagement in IPF process promotes further development and stability.

**Organization of Mind**:

- Patients describe seeing calm, stable, and affectionate parent figures.
- These figures have a positive impact on their inner state.

### MANIFESTATIONS OF AN INTERNALIZED SECURE BASE
When a secure base has been internalized through the Internal Parent Figure (IPF) process, several indicators emerge in the patient's imagery:

1. **Consistent and Stable Attachment-Promoting Qualities**:
   - Imagined parent figures respond to the patient in ways that reassure and understand their fears.
   - Parent figures are comforting, supportive, and trusting.

2. **Consistent and Stable Benefits**:
   - Patients feel safe, supported, and encouraged to explore and express themselves.
   - They experience a sense of confidence, courage, and willingness to venture out into the world.

3. **Exploratory Behavior**:
   - Patients make excursions away from parent figures in their imagery.
   - They feel safe enough to explore new places and experiences.
   - Parent figures are interested in the patient's connections and support their growth.

**Indications of an Internalized Secure Base**:

1. **Safe-Haven Seeking**:
   - Patients go to caregivers when distressed for comfort and reassurance.

2. **Proximity Seeking**:
   - Patients show a preference for physical closeness and affection from parent figures.

**Examples of Exploratory Behavior in the Imagery**:

**Patient**:
- "I have space to do what I want to do. I feel like they trust me. They’re there to guide me, not form me."
- "I can express that, physically move to something new. It’s a new feeling in myself, a kind of like courage."
- "They know how important that is. They want to support my own connections."
- "I can look around more. I’m walking. I don’t have to worry about things."
- "It feels like the connection has become fully established. Now it's about me being more active, because I have the trust and connection with them now."

**Significant Change in Experience of Relationship**:

**Patient**:
- "It feels like a meeting has taken place among the three of us ... it feels very different than before ... it feels like a starting point, like I can start to do things, and they can start to guide me and help me in ways that are right."
- "They can be supportive in ways I’ve never experienced before."
- "Fundamentally they’re interested in me. I guess I can start to be me, with their guidance."

### Reinforcing the Internalized Secure Base

When a patient exhibits signs of a secure base in their imagery during Imaginal Flooding (IPF) sessions, the therapist helps to extend, strengthen, and deepen that state by applying the following principles:

1. **Mirroring**: The therapist reflects back the patient's words and feelings to show understanding and validation.
2. **Bringing attention to felt experience**: The therapist encourages patients to focus on their sensations and emotions during secure moments.
3. **Amplifying positive states**: The therapist enhances positive emotions and feelings by asking patients to describe them in detail.
4. **Anchoring positive states in body experience**: The therapist helps patients connect positive emotions with physical sensations for greater familiarity and mastery.
5. **Suggesting new scenes**: The therapist introduces new scenarios where the desired state is also present, allowing patients to expand their experiences of security.

**Example of Reinforcing the Secure Base**

**Patient**: "We’re on a beach, a rocky beach. I can go and get rocks, and come back and give them to them, and they receive them." 
**Therapist**: "Yes, you can go and get rocks, and then come back to them. Notice what it’s like as you go off by yourself, really feeling that they’re there for you. You can feel that secure feeling, can’t you?"

**Time Expansion**
When a patient is deeply immersed in the imagery, time can be expanded to allow positive states to be experienced for longer durations, enhancing familiarity and mastery of desired qualities.

**Therapist**: "And now, even though only a few moments of clock time will pass, it will seem like much longer time elapses, long enough for you to experience this safety in a way that makes it so very familiar to you. You have all the time it takes for this safety to become part of you, to experience it more and more as a foundation of who you are."

**Working with Present Experience and Reducing Frequency of IPF Sessions**

As indications of an internalized secure base become more consistent and vivid in a patient's IPF experience, they will report greater security in their daily life. The therapist reinforces these experiences by mirroring and amplifying positive emotions and sensations. New scenes are suggested to help patients apply the feeling of security to various situations in their lives.

- **Patient**: In classes I often want to say something, but I get too nervous and I just stay silent. 
- **Therapist**: Yes, you’ve been wanting to express yourself in classes. Now really tune in to the secure feeling; really tune in to that feeling, and let me know when you’re feeling it really clearly. 
- **Patient**: I’m feeling it. 
- **Therapist**: Good. Now, with this secure feeling really present, imagine being in class. And when you are imagining yourself in class, feeling secure and comfortable, let me know. 
- **Patient**: Okay, I’m there. 
- **Therapist**: Wonderful. Now, just feel yourself there in class, feeling secure and comfortable, coming to feel it even more clearly. And when you’re ready, imagine yourself feeling ready to raise your hand to say something. 

This process continues as the patient imagines each step toward the desired action in the context of an inner, felt experience of a secure base.

**IPF Protocol in Attachment-Based Therapy: Reinforcing Secure Base and Regulating Affects**

The IPF protocol continues to be beneficial in attachment-based therapy at later stages of treatment, despite a gradual reduction in frequency. Two primary ways the IPF protocol is useful are:

1. **Reinforcing secure base**: A secure base results from the development of new, positive attachment representations. The stronger and more stable these representations are, the stronger and more stable the secure base will be. Signs of insecurity may reappear when the secure base is challenged, necessitating IPF sessions to reinforce the secure base.
2. **Working with present-day affective states**: The IPF protocol can help regulate various affective states, such as anxiety, sadness, loneliness, or anger. Regardless of the circumstance that evoked the feeling or whether the patient currently feels it in the session, the affect state can be brought into the IPF imagery for regulation.

**IPF Session Process**:

1. **Establishing the anxious/uncomfortable state**: The therapist guides the patient to focus on the uncomfortable affect state and feel it more intensely by imagining being in the circumstance that contributed to its emergence.
2. **Initiating IPF protocol**: The therapist asks the patient to imagine going back in time, feeling much the same way as a young child, and then introduces ideal parents who are attuned specifically to the patient's affective state. These parents provide comfort and security, helping the patient regulate their emotions.
3. **Reestablishing secure base**: The therapist brings the reestablished secure state back to the present situation, allowing the patient to experience feeling comfortable, confident, and secure in their adult self.
4. **Addressing other affective states**: Similar steps are taken when addressing other affective states, such as sadness or anger.

**Example of IPF Session for Anxiety**:

1. The patient reports anxiety about his girlfriend ending their relationship.
2. The therapist establishes that there is no indication of a breakup and discusses how the anxiety might indicate a threat to security.
3. The therapist guides the patient to imagine himself as a young child feeling anxious and then introduces ideal parents who recognize and soothe his anxiety.
4. The patient experiences comfort, confidence, and security in the imagery and brings it back to the present situation with his girlfriend.
5. The patient feels slightly more anxious but establishes a plan for increased time together that he feels comfortable with.

**Example of IPF Session for Sadness**:

1. The patient reports feeling sad.
2. The therapist guides the patient to focus on the sadness and imagine himself back in the circumstance that contributed to its emergence.
3. The therapist introduces ideal parents who recognize and soothe the patient's sadness, helping him regulate his emotions.
4. The patient explores and works with the imagery until the parent figures are accurately attuned to his affect state and alleviate it.

### Common Challenges During the IPF Treatment Process

### Difficulties Patients May Experience with the IPF Protocol

Patients may encounter challenges when implementing the IPF protocol, and therapists should respond using the following principles:

1. **Being empathic**:
   - Understand that patients might experience discomfort due to painful childhood memories.
   - Respond with empathy and support, acknowledging their feelings and validating their experiences.
   - Allow patients to feel safe and attuned in the therapy environment.

2. **Maintaining a collaborative stance**:
   - Adopt a curious, interested, confident, and patient attitude during the shared task of establishing and engaging with ideal parent figures.
   - Model openness and willingness to address any difficulties that arise.

3. **Contextualizing patient difficulties within the IPF imagery frame**:
   - Keep experiences within the imagery frame to allow parent figures to respond in beneficial ways.
   - Reinforce the therapeutic frame, contributing to its ongoing effectiveness as part of the attachment-repair process.

**Specific Patient Difficulties and Therapist Responses**

1. **Inability to experientially imagine being a very young child**:
   - Understand that it's common for patients to have difficulty accessing their child-self state due to past experiences.
   - Encourage patience and persistence, as the ability to imagine being a young child is essential for the IPF method to be effective.
   - Offer reassurance and support, emphasizing that it's normal for patients to struggle with this aspect of the therapy.
2. **Difficulty trusting parent figures**:
   - Validate patients' feelings of mistrust and assure them that parent figures are present and patient.
   - Encourage patients to explore their fears and doubts within the imagery frame, allowing parent figures to respond in beneficial ways.
3. **Resistance or avoidance of engaging with the methods**:
   - Understand that some patients might initially resist or avoid engaging with the IPF method due to past experiences.
   - Offer empathy and support, acknowledging their feelings and validating their experiences.
   - Encourage patience and persistence, emphasizing that most patients eventually find their way into the IPF imagery and benefit from it.

**Child State Experience**

The therapist guides the patient towards experiencing themselves as a child by asking them to nod when they feel themselves in that state. If the patient is unable to do so, the therapist encourages them to continue trying and uses displacement methods to help them get there.

**Displacement Methods**

1. **Documentary Show**: The therapist asks the patient to imagine watching a documentary about people who had difficulty feeling themselves as children but eventually found ways to do so. The patient reports what each person says, normalizing the difficulty and suggesting solutions.
2. **Imagining a Displaced Self**: If the patient cannot imagine being a child even with displacement, the therapist asks them to imagine a scene where they see a child who is much like they were and proceeds with the protocol using that child as a proxy. After some sessions, the therapist encourages the patient to bring themselves more directly into the protocol.

**First-person vs. Third-person Experience**

The therapist's language can be adapted for both first-person and third-person experiences of the child-self. For most patients, a first-person experience will emerge as the protocol proceeds.

**Imagining an Older Child, Teenager, or Young Adult**

If a patient imagines being an older child, teenager, or young adult instead of a child, the therapist may encourage them to imagine being even younger or continue with the protocol using their current age. Alternatively, the therapist may use documentary-show displacement imagery to help the patient find ways of imagining being younger.

**Patient's Response**

If the patient still cannot feel themselves as a child after trying various methods, the therapist may choose not to proceed with the protocol as if the patient can and instead create a broader displacement using a scene with a child who is much like they were. After some sessions, the therapist will encourage the patient to bring themselves more directly into the protocol.

**It is not uncommon for patients to imagine themselves at different ages during different IPF sessions.**

- Imagining self as older can be part of remapping process
- Resistance to generating ideal parent figures is common

**Resistance to IPF protocol**:

* Difficulty imagining ideal parent figures due to past experiences
* Patients may refuse to continue with the treatment
* **Empathic response from therapist**: "I really understand that this is hard for you at first"
* Suggestion to try despite difficulty
* Introduce inner child method if necessary

**Inner Child Method**:

* Transition to imagining ideal parent figures
* Patient-as-child is met by patient-as-best-adult-self
* Best adult self provides security and wellbeing
* Return to suggesting ideal parent figures after session

**Disloyalty or Dishonoring Actual Parents**:

* Some patients resist imagining ideal parents due to feelings of disloyalty or dishonor
* Emphasize that there is no intention to discredit actual parents
* Ideal parents would treat actual parents with kindness and respect
* Work within the frame if patient feels disloyalty or dishonor

**Difficulties Imagining Ideal Parent Figures**:

* Subtle resistance, lack of readily available models, or misunderstanding of task
* No parent figures are imagined (common for patients with dismissing attachment)
* Reassure patient that it takes time and collaborate on the task
* Highlight felt sense instead of visual expectations
* Use inner child method if necessary
* Return to attempts to evoke ideal parent figures after session.

**Imaginal Processing (IP) and Attachment**:

* Imagined parent figures are vague or distant for some patients, indicating engagement of attachment system.
* **Therapist's role**: enhance clarity of parent figures within the imagery frame.

**Engagement of Memory vs. Imagination**:

* Patients may bring up actual parents (memory) or imagined ideal parents (imagination).
* Engaging memory related to actual parents can limit possibilities for secure attachment imagery, potentially reinforcing problematic parental representations.
* Therapist encourages use of imagination to create new and different set of parents.

**Patient Examples**:

1. **Patient sees parents but feels distant**:
   * Therapist emphasizes safety and closeness.
   * Patient's upper body joins parents, feeling whole and secure.
2. **Patient sees parents through gauzy material**:
   * Therapist acknowledges difficulty of connection and offers help to overcome it.
   * Parent figures understand and provide for patient's needs.

**Actual Parents vs. Imagined Ideal Parent Figures**:

* Actual parents may appear in imagery, reflecting engagement of memory rather than imagination.
* Therapist encourages use of imagination to create new parents with best qualities from actual parents and additional attachment-promoting traits.

**Nonhuman Ideal Parent Figures**:

* Some patients create nonhuman ideal parent figures due to attachment wounds making human attachment figures too threatening.
* Therapist prompts patient to imagine human figures but accepts nonhuman figures if patient persists.
* With each subsequent IP session, therapist makes specific reference to human parents.

**One Ideal Parent Figure**

* Patient may initially only imagine one clear parent figure
* Represents the less abusive, neglectful, or absent parent
* Therapist allows patient to focus on present parent figure while gently prompting for absent one

**Difficulties in Relationships with Ideal Parent Figures**

* Activation of pre-treatment disturbed attachment representations
* Parent figures may behave in ways that mirror actual parents' behavior
* Therapist suggests parents recognize and understand patient's concerns, reassure and show love

**Breaking the Imagery Frame**

* Memories of actual parents intruding on imagined parent figures
* Therapist acknowledges memory but does not engage with it
* Suggests returning to imagined parents as positive opposites of actual parents

**Exceptions to Responding within the Frame**

* Parent figures become rejecting, neglectful, or abusive
* Therapist calls for change in frame and new scene with protective parent figures

**Difficulties Spontaneously Breaking the Imagery Frame**

* Patients may have trouble establishing ideal parent figures
* Maintaining positive experience and imagery frame
* Insecure inner working models of attachment make it challenging

**Examples of Breaks from the Frame**

* Memories of actual parents intruding on imagined parent figures
	+ Therapist acknowledges memory but does not engage with it
	+ Suggests returning to imagined parents as positive opposites of actual parents
* Patient doubts imagery process and experiences it as "fake" or "too good to be true"
	+ Therapist stays within the frame, reassuring patient and helping them reengage
* Patient becomes affectively overwhelmed or confused during the protocol
	+ Therapist maintains the imagery frame, suggesting ideal parent figures respond empathically and effectively.

### DIFFICULTIES THAT THERAPISTS MAY HAVE WITH THE IPF PROTOCOL

**Self-doubt about skill with the protocol**:

* Greater skill and confidence come with training, study, practice, and experience.
* **Ways to address self-doubt**:
  * Reread this chapter and refer to specific sections as needed.
  * Obtain supervision from qualified practitioners of Three Pillars treatment approach.
  * Recognize the collaborative aspect of working with the protocol.
  * Revise and refine application based on patient's responses and ongoing learning.

**Resistance to regular and consistent application of the protocol**:

* Benefits are most efficiently established by applying it during nearly every session.
* Resistance may come from self-doubt or familiarity with other methods.
* Flexibility is appropriate, but IPF protocol should be the primary focus.
* Address any internal resistance or deviation from treatment frame.

**Concern that use of suggestion is manipulative or controlling**:

* Use of suggestion and shaping are central components of IPF method.
* Suggestion sets an imagery frame, within which patient is free to create unique forms.
* Therapist's subsequent shaping based on research-based understanding of secure attachment development.
* Permissively establishing conditions for activation of patients' own innate attachment system.

**Doubt about IPF method due to lack of or inconsistent signs of progress**:

* Patients may not form IPF imagery quickly or consistently.
* Difficulty forming parent figures is expected, especially for patients with strongly deactivated attachment systems.
* Progress may not be linear or consistent.
* Signs of an internalized secure base may take time to emerge.
* Patiently continue IPF work until the internalized secure base is established.

### DIFFICULTIES PERTAINING TO THE PATIENT–THERAPIST DYAD

**Difficulties Pertaining to the Patient-Therapist Dyad**

* **Two primary forms of difficulty**:
  * Collaborative avoidance of IPF protocol
  * Affect-laden breach in collaborative engagement with the protocol and rupture in relationship with therapist

**Collusive Avoidance of IPF Protocol**

* Ideal collaboration between patient and therapist to engage IPF protocol
* Both may collude to avoid its use due to attachment system challenges or self-doubt
* **Signs of collusive avoidance**:
  * Patient brings crises or urgent issues for discussion instead of IPF protocol
  * Therapist responds by participating in discussion rather than using IPF protocol
  * Ambivalence about the protocol leading to agreement not to use it during session
* **Prevention and remedy**:
  * Recognize potential for collusive avoidance
  * Understand reasons for resistance
  * Collaboratively watch for signs of avoidance
  * Address factors contributing to avoidance immediately

**Imagery Frame Breaks and Therapy Relationship Ruptures**

* Patient's spontaneous breaks from imagery frame without therapist involvement discussed in patient difficulties section
* **Affect-laden breach**:
  * Patient expresses negative affect towards therapist
  * Therapist does not respond from within the imagery frame or attachment system
* **Example**:
  * Patient feels abandoned and hates both therapist and self
  * Therapist acknowledges patient's anger and explores experience collaboratively
* Restoration of collaborative and attachment behavioral systems
* Challenges specific to each insecure attachment subtype addressed in subsequent chapters.

### Recognizing Successful IPF Treatment

**Ideal Parent Figure (IPF) Treatment**: This is a method used to support the development of secure attachment in patients. It is an efficient, positive-focused approach that integrates conditions known to promote secure attachment.

**Steps in IPF Treatment**:

1. **Relaxation and Accessing Behavioral Memory System**: The patient is guided to shift focus inward and relax their body to access the behavioral memory system where attachment representations form.
2. **Engaging Imagination as a Child**: Patient imagines being themselves as a child to evoke a felt sense of childhood experiences and activate the attachment system.
3. **Introduction of Ideal Parent Figures**: Patients work with therapists to shape the imagery of ideal parent figures that meet their longings, wants, and needs for attachment security.
4. **Healing through Imagination**: Patients have new, positive experiences through the creative power of imagination without focusing on painful childhood history.
5. **Dealing with Difficulties**: Patients may face difficulties during this process, but they are expected and met in ways that contribute to attachment security development.

**Benefits of IPF Treatment**:
- Effective in promoting secure attachment repair
- Does not require focus on painful childhood history
- Encourages new, positive experiences
- Deeply moving for both patients and therapists

**Patient Testimonial**: A 57-year-old woman shared her experience after six IPF sessions:
1. **Initial Experience**: She visualized simple situations with ideal parents who loved and cared for her.
2. **Healing Childhood Memories**: She felt that she had more childhood memories than before, and the feelings of warmth, safety, and joy from new memories became a part of her real childhood experiences.
3. **Confidence and Self-Esteem**: Her negative feelings towards her parents faded, and she gained self-esteem and awareness of her faults without feeling the need to hide them.
4. **Improved Relationships**: She reported improved relationships with her son, friends, colleagues, and even her real parents.
5. **Overall Transformation**: After only six sessions, she experienced remarkable transformation in her inner state and relationships.

**Importance of IPF Treatment**: This method focuses on the attachment behavioral system but also engages and strengthens metacognitive and collaborative behavioral systems. Comprehensive treatment for attachment insecurity that includes all three interdependent systems promotes greater mental, emotional health, and wellbeing.

**3. Attachment Theory**
   * **Bowlby and Ainsworth**: Pioneers of attachment theory
   * **Attachment Styles**: Secure, Anxious-Preoccupied, Avoidant, Disorganized
   * **Impact on Development**: Influences cognitive, emotional, and social development throughout the lifespan

   * **Components**: Awareness, reflection, planning, and action
   * **Intervention Techniques**: Mentalization-based therapy, schema therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and emotion-focused therapy

**5. Mentalization-Based Therapy (MBT)**
   * **Development**: Developed by Allan Schore and Peter Fonagy
   * **Goals**: Helps individuals understand their own and others' mental states and intentions
   * **Techniques**: Role-play, reflective dialogue, and mentalization exercises

**6. Schema Therapy**
   * **Development**: Developed by Jeffrey Young and Janet Klosko
   * **Goals**: Identifies and challenges maladaptive schemas related to attachment
   * **Techniques**: Imaginal exposure, cognitive restructuring, and emotional processing

**7. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**
   * **Adapting for Attachment Disturbances**: Focuses on identifying and challenging maladaptive thoughts related to attachment
   * **Techniques**: Identification of negative automatic thoughts, cognitive restructuring, and behavioral experiments

**8. Emotion-Focused Therapy (EFT)**
   * **Development**: Developed by Leslie Greenberg and Robert Elliott
   * **Goals**: Helps individuals process emotions related to attachment experiences
   * **Techniques**: Two-chair dialogue, emotion-focused imagery, and experiential techniques

**Historical Development of Metacognitive Interventions in Attachment-Based Therapy**

The history of metacognitive interventions in attachment-based therapy can be categorized into four generations of metacognition:

1. **Appearance–Reality Distinction and the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)**
   * John Flavell's seminal paper in 1979 introduced metacognition as a new area of investigation, defining it as "thinking about thinking" or knowledge about cognitive processes.
   * Early research focused on the appearance–reality distinction, recognizing that experiences of reality can be represented differently.
   * Flavell and his associates developed a laboratory test to assess the development of this distinction in three- and five-year-olds using objects with different appearances and realities.
   * Children's ability to make an appearance–reality distinction improved with age, indicating their growing understanding that constructions of reality can be limited or erroneous.
   * Alison Gopnik extended this research by investigating representational change and diversity in three- and five-year-olds.
   * Three-year-olds generally lacked representational diversity and change, while five-year-olds began to demonstrate these abilities.

2. **Reflective Functioning Scale (RF-S) and Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT)**
   * Peter Fonagy and his associates developed the Reflective Functioning Scale and mentalization-based treatment, focusing on the ability to understand mental states and mentalize others.
   * MBT aims to improve reflective functioning by helping individuals develop a more accurate understanding of their own and others' thoughts, feelings, and intentions.

3. **Modular Approach to Metacognitive Psychotherapy**
   * Research by Antonio Semerari and Giovanni Liotti at the Third Center of Cognitive Psychotherapy led to the development of a modular approach to metacognitive psychotherapy.
   * This approach emphasizes the importance of identifying specific metacognitive skills and targeting them in therapy.

4. **Higher Cognitive Development**
   * Research on higher cognitive development and its implications for understanding the full range of metacognitive skills is ongoing.
   * This generation builds upon previous research by exploring advanced metacognitive abilities, such as self-reflection, introspection, and meta-emotion regulation.

**Experiments on Children's Metacognition**

* Gopnik and Graf (1988) studied children's ability to identify the source of their knowledge about hidden objects.
  * Three-year-olds had difficulty identifying the source after a delay, indicating limited metarepresentational ability.
  * Five-year-olds had no such difficulties.
* Harris et al. (1986) investigated children's ability to distinguish real from apparent emotions in stories.
  * Four-year-olds had limited ability, but six-year-olds were quite capable.

**Definition and Components of Metacognition**

* **Metacognition**: thinking about thought (Main, 1991)
  * Reflecting on the validity, nature, and source of thoughts
* **Metacognitive knowledge**: reflecting on the nature of thought
* **Metacognitive monitoring**: reflecting on the source and validity of thoughts

**Metacognition and Attachment**

* Main (1991) hypothesized that securely attached children have more developed metacognitive capacities than insecurely attached children of the same age.
* Secure children can distinguish appearance from reality, understand the privacy of thought, and monitor cognitive processes.
* Insecure children exhibit "failures of corrective metacognitive monitoring" and are likely to develop multiple internal working models for attachment.

**Metacognitive Monitoring on the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)**

* Main et al. (2002) incorporated ideas about metacognition into the **Metacognitive Monitoring scale on the AAI**.
* Recognition of appearance–reality distinctions, understanding of representational change, and diversity, and fresh comments illustrating monitoring of reaction patterns are examples of metacognitive monitoring on the AAI.
* Error monitoring, such as commenting on the fact that a belief or memory might be distorted or limited, also increases the metacognitive monitoring score.
* **The scale produces a rating of the degree of metacognitive monitoring**: 
  - (1) none
  - (3) possible
  - (5) some monitoring
  - (7) marked monitoring
  - (9) metacognitive monitoring characterizing the interview.

**Limitations of the First Generation of Metacognition Research**

* The range and types of metacognition are poorly represented on the AAI.
* The scale is limited to self-monitoring and does not address any metacognitive reflection on the state of mind of the other.

**Second-Generation Research on Metacognition**

* Fonagy and his associates addressed these issues in their second-generation research.

### SECOND GENERATION: INTERSUBJECTIVITY, MENTALIZATION, AND THE REFLECTIVE FUNCTIONING SCALE


The second generation of research in metacognition, led by Peter Fonagy, Anthony Bateman, and their associates from the London School, focused on the development of mentalization and reflective function in childhood. 

This research was influenced by developmental theory of mind and social biofeedback theory of parental-affect mirroring, particularly the work of Gyorgy Gergely and John Watson.

* **Recognition of Intentionality**
  * Children develop capacity to detect other's intentions around 9-12 months
  * Allows representation of beliefs, desires, emotions of others (intersubjectivity)
* **Parental Affect Mirroring**
  * Mothers play vital role in modulating infant's affective states
  * Quality of maternal interactions influence infant's emotional development
  * Secure mothers show increased coordination and synchronization with infant's affect display
* **Interactive Process as Training**
  * **Contingency detection**: infant recognizes caregiver's response is contingent on own behavior
  * **Marking**: caregiver produces exaggerated emotional expression to help infant decouple emotion from their own and become sensitive to internal cues
* **Developmental Functions of Parental Affect Mirroring**
  1. Sensitization to internal states
  2. Building secondary representations as intersubjective structures
  3. Regulation of child's internal emotional state
  4. Developing a generalized affective communication code based on pretend, play, and knowing representations as representations

Gergely and Watson (1996) argue that parental-affect mirroring provides natural social biofeedback training for the infant, playing a crucial role in emotional development. Consistent marking produces additional development with respect to mentalizing capacity by creating a separate representation of marked emotions as secondary structures, which is the foundation of mentalization.

**Parental "Deviant Mirroring Styles" and Developmental Psychopathology**

- *Gergely and Watson* (1996) discuss implications of parental mirroring styles on emotion development in infants.
- ***Congruent but unmarked form of affective mirroring*: emotion not decoupled from parent, secondary representation not established.**: "You're uncomfortable."
- ***Marked but noncongruent affective mirroring*: infant develops distorted secondary representation of primary emotional state and pathologically distorted self-representations.**: "You’re so uncomfortable (laughing)."
- Changing these forms of developmental pathology possible through therapy or beneficial experiences.

**Reflective Function (RF) in Child Development**

- *London group's expansion on metacognitive capacity in children*
- **RF**: processes reflecting on self and others, distinguishing inner and outer reality
- Draws from Dennett's thesis, Freudian theories, and others
- **Fonagy and Target (1997)**: child responds to others' beliefs, feelings, etc.

**Factors Influencing RF Development**

- Caretaker with predisposition to see relationships in terms of mental content
- Allows normal growth of infant's mental function, leading to secure attachment and less reliance on defensive behaviors

**Assessing Reflective Function (RF)**

- Developed the Reflective Functioning Scale (RF-S) for assessing RF using AAI transcripts or clinical session transcripts
- Wider range of metacognitive capacities than AAI Metacognitive Monitoring scale

**Assesses four discrete categories or dimensions of reflective functioning**:
- **Category A: Awareness of the Nature of Mental States**
  - Knowing that mental states exist and can influence behavior
  - **Example**: "My parents' feelings towards each other affected how they treated me." 
- **Category B: Explicit Effort to Tease Out Mental States Underlying Behavior**
  - Ability to infer mental states from observable behaviors
  - **Example**: "I think my mother was anxious when she kept repeating herself."
- **Category C: Recognition of the Developmental Dimension of Mental States**
  - Understanding that mental states change over time and can be influenced by development
  - **Example**: "My parents' relationship changed as we grew older, which affected their reactions to me."
- **Category D: Recognition of Mental States in Relation to the Interviewer**
  - Ability to recognize interviewer's mental states and respond accordingly
  - **Example**: "I think you might be confused about my relationship with my parents."

**Scoring RF**

- Each response is given a score based on the degree of reflective function present
- Scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater reflective function.

**Characteristics of Mental States**

* **Opaqueness**:
  * Uncertainty regarding a mental state.
  * Uncertainty about which alternative mental states might be associated with a given behavior.
    * **Example**: "I think that my relationship with my parents became closer in my early 20s, but I’m not sure." (4)
* **Susceptibility to Disguise**:
  * Recognition that one's own and others' mental states can be disguised.
    * **Example**: "I think that my relationship with my parents grew closer when I became a young adult, although my parents quickly became financially dependent on me, so it was hard to tell how they really felt." (5)
* **Limitations on Insight**:
  * Awareness of limitations in one's ability to understand self and others.
    * **Example**: "I think that my mother felt closer to me when I began to have children, but I'm not sure." (4)
* **Tied to Expressions of Appropriate Normative Judgments**:
  * Recognition of mental states as expectable responses to specific circumstances.
    * **Example**: "When I was 18, I started to stay out past 10. She gave me the ‘cold shoulder’ on these occasions, I guess because she was angry and like many adults didn't understand that I had matured to adolescence." (3)
* **Defensive Nature**:
  * Statements indicating recognition that mental states can be modified to reduce negative affect.
    * **Example**: "He seemed to ignore times when I was respectful, I guess because he believed in strict parenting." (5)

**Mental State Identification**

* Explicit effort to identify mental states underlying behavior
  * Accurate attribution of mental states to others
    * Specific causal accounts of behavior in terms of mental states
      * **Example**: "My parents have changed very little over the years with respect to their views about child rearing; they treated my children not unlike the way they treated me, or this is how it seems to me." (6)
  * Envisioning the possibility that feelings may be unrelated to reality
    * Recognition that affect may be inconsistent with external situation
      * **Example**: "Even though I was incarcerated, I think that my parents and I sort of had a better relationship, you know, when I became an adult, because that is the way things go as you get older." (3)
  * Recognition of diverse perspectives
    * Explicit acknowledgment that different people may perceive behavior or situation differently
      * **Example**: "After I moved out of the house, I feel that I became the parent and my mother became the child. It was all about her creating a situation so attention was focused on her, or so it seemed to me. She would have disagreed." (6)
  * Taking into account one's own mental state in interpreting others' behavior
    * Recognition that interpretation might be distorted by one's feelings or thoughts
      * **Example**: "Well, when he moved to the West Coast, after he divorced my mother, I certainly talked to my father less than when he was living with us. He didn't invite me to his wedding because I guess he assumed that I wouldn't have gone." (5)
  * Evaluating mental states from the point of view of their impact on self and others
    * Awareness of role one's own mental states had on behaviors
      * **Example**: "I think I was needy and demanding, and that probably was off-putting to him." (6)
  * Taking into account how others perceive one
    * Recognition of how others' perceptions are influenced by their own or others' actions and reactions
      * **Example**: "I think other people saw me as pushy, but I just didn't have confidence." (5)
  * A freshness of recall and thinking about mental states
    * Spontaneous expressions indicating something currently thought or realized
      * **Example**: "...but as I think about it now, my father’s refusal to talk about his past may have been to protect me, not to keep it secret from me as I used to feel. Does this make sense to you?" (7)

**Recognizing Developmental Aspects of Mental States**

1. Taking an intergenerational perspective, recognizing the exchange of ideas, feelings, and behavior across generations.
   * **Example**: parents coming to adult children with problems about younger siblings.
2. Taking a developmental perspective, acknowledging that mental states and perspectives change with age.
   * **Example**: relationship with parents growing closer during college years.
3. Revising thoughts and feelings about childhood in light of understanding gained since childhood.
   * **Example**: used to think all people were wretched but no longer holds that belief.
4. Envisioning changes in mental states between past, present, and future.
   * **Example**: change from child to adolescent perspective on relationships.
5. Understanding transactional processes between parent and child, recognizing influence and impact on each other.
   * **Example**: lazy behavior leading to parental pressure.
6. Awareness of family dynamics, seeing the family as an interdependent system.
   * **Example**: understanding difference between children and adolescents.

**Mental States in Relation to the Interviewer**

* Acknowledging the separateness of mind, recognizing interviewer's unique experiences and mental stance.
  * **Example**: difficult relationship with mother but allowed her to move in.
* Not assuming knowledge, clarifying confusing aspects for interviewer. 
  * **Example**: explaining reasons behind relationship change with stepmother.
* Emotional attunement, recognizing potential emotional impact on interviewer. 
  * **Example**: relationship with mother changing after father's death and noticing interviewer's tears.

**RF-S Scoring**

The RF-S scoring is modeled after the Metacognitive Monitoring scale of the AAI, ranging from –1 to 9.

* **–1**: Distinctly anti-reflective or bizarre/inappropriate RF
* **0**: Disavowed or absent RF
* **1**: Absent but not repudiated RF
* **3**: Questionable or Low RF
* **5**: Definite or Ordinary RF
* **7**: Marked RF
* **9**: Exceptional RF

**Attachment Security and Reflective Functioning (RF)**

- Attachment security is measured using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) and the Strange Situation procedure for infants
- RF is a key concept in the second generation of attachment research, which goes beyond self-monitoring to include mentalizing about mental states of self and others
- **RF has four dimensions**: nature of mental states, mental states associated with behavior, developmental aspects, mental states in relation to the interviewer

**Attachment Security Scores and RF**

- A score of –1 to 1 is consistent with disorganized attachment and may indicate borderline or antisocial personality disorder or dissociative disorders
- A score of less than 3 is associated with dismissing or anxious-preoccupied insecure status
- A score of 4 or 5 is associated with either insecure or secure status
- Scores of 6 to 9 are associated with secure status
- Less is known about typical RF scores for individuals with Unresolved/disoriented (Ud) status on the AAI, but it is rare for them to score above a 5

**RF as a Mediating Variable in Parent-Infant Attachment**

- Fonagy et al. (1995) found that RF level differentiated whether infants of insecure parents were secure or insecure based on the parents' RF scores and attachment status
- Parents with insecure status and high RF were more likely to have infants with secure status than were insecure parents with low RF

**Advantages of RF Research**

- RF goes beyond self-monitoring to include mentalizing about mental states of both self and other
- **RF is a unitary function with differentiated dimensions**: nature of mental states, mental states associated with behavior, developmental aspects, mental states in relation to the interviewer
- The capacity to recognize representations as constructions and take perspective and contextualize mental states are the two fundamental factors operating across these dimensions

**Clinical Significance of RF Research**

- PD and DD patients generally score very low on RF, justifying the development of mentalization-based treatment (MBT) to develop reflective capacity
- MBT has demonstrated efficacy and clinical effectiveness with borderline personality disorder patients

**Limitations of RF Research**

- RF is seen as a unitary function, but deficits in metacognition are often pathology-specific
- Different clinical conditions may be characterized by different metacognitive strengths and deficits rather than simply different degrees of overall RF or metacognitive capacity

**Third Generation of Metacognitive Research**

- The Rome Center of Cognitive Psychotherapy addresses the limitation of RF research by focusing on pathology-specific metacognitive strengths and deficits in the third generation of metacognitive research.

### THIRD GENERATION: THE MODULAR, PSYCHOPATHOLOGY-SPECIFIC APPROACH

The Third Center of Cognitive Psychotherapy in Rome, led by Antonio Semerari, Giancarlo Dimaggio, and Giovanni Liotti, has advanced the understanding of metacognition and its manifestations in clinical populations. In contrast to the London group's view of reflective function as a unitary construct with various dimensions, the Rome group considers metacognition as a collection of independent capacities. They developed the Metacognitive Assessment Scale (MAS) to evaluate metacognitive capacities in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD), narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), and dissociative identity disorder (DID).

**Metacognitive Capacities**

The Rome group identified six distinct metacognitive capacities:

1. **Identification:**
   * Ability to distinguish, recognize, and define one's own or another's inner states (emotions, cognitions).
   * Divided into two subfunctions: recognizing one's own representations and recognizing emotions.
2. **Relating Variables:**
   * Ability to establish relations among separate components of mental states and between mental states and behavior.
   * Through Relating Variables, a subject explains their own behavior in terms of causes and/or motivations.
3. **Differentiation:**
   * Ability to recognize that the contents of representations are subjective events and different from reality.
   * Acknowledges the subjectivity of our representations and recognizes the limits of their influence on reality.
4. **Integration:**
   * Ability to work out coherent descriptions of one's mental states and processes.
   * Takes a narrative form and gives a sense of continuity.
   * Divided into two items: providing an integrated description of one’s own mental state and describing changes over time in one’s own mental states.
5. **Decentration:**
   * Ability to comprehend another individual's mental state from a non-egocentric perspective.
   * Enables recognizing the hypothetical nature of our reading of other individuals’ minds.
6. **Mastery:**
   * Ability to work through one's representations and mental states with a view to implementing effective action strategies.
   * Defined as regulation and control activities.
   * Divided into three levels: first-level strategies, second-level strategies, and third-level strategies.
   * Awareness of one’s state in a way that leads to regulation or change of that state.

**Metacognitive Profiles for BPD and NPD**

The Rome group reported specific metacognitive deficits in patients with BPD and NPD and described how each patient manifests psychopathology-specific metacognitive deficits.

BPD patients showed relatively normal metacognitive identification and the ability to think according to relating variables but significant deficits in metacognitive differentiation early on, which didn't change much throughout treatment, and severe deficits in metacognitive integration and mastery that didn't change much either.

NPD patients showed an initial deficit in metacognitive identification and a stronger deficit in relating variables that improved slowly over the course of treatment. Differentiation failures varied throughout the course of treatment, integration improved over treatment, and mastery was moderate.

**Examples of Metacognitive Deficits in BPD and NPD Patients**

**Borderline (BPD) patient**: 
- "I was furious" (good identification); 
- "I've been feeling this way since he didn't call me back" (good relating variables); 
- "I know that I'm the only one of his girlfriends that he's ever blown off like this" (poor differentiation); 
- "I hate him and I always have and I always will" (poor integration); 
- "I might as well kill myself because there’s nothing else I can do" (poor mastery)

**Narcissistic (NPD) patient**:
- "I don't have any feelings about her. I don't have any feelings, period" (poor identification);
- "I don't have a clue why this is so" (poor relating variables);
- "She’s been sending me emails every day. I know she’s trying to flatter me" (poor differentiation); 
- "Don't ask me why, but I know she’s madly in love with me" (poor integration); 
- "I’m just going to label her emails as spam. No way am I going to write her back" (Level 1 mastery)

**Implications for Treatment**

The findings from the Rome group highlight that effective treatment for BPD must include improving their metacognitive differentiation, integration, and mastery. For NPD patients, initially focusing on enhancing their capacity to identify their own and others' mental states may be more beneficial. However, it is essential to consider individual differences in metacognitive profiles when designing interventions for each patient.

### FOURTH GENERATION: BEYOND MENTAL CONSTRUCTIONS AND RELATIVISM OF MENTAL STATES

The London and Rome groups have made significant contributions to our understanding of metacognitive functioning and its therapeutic value, particularly for individuals with personality disorders or attachment disturbances. However, this third generation of metacognitive research and treatment has limitations.

**Limitations of Third Generation Metacognition**:

- Focuses on reflective function (RF) which is limited to second-order intersubjectivity.
- Belies a constructivist theory of mind.
- Rome group expands metacognition beyond constructivism to include recognition of the relativism of mental states but does not account for developmental levels of mind beyond constructivism and relativism.

**Necessity of Considering Entire Trajectory of Life Span Development**:

To gain a more comprehensive understanding of metacognition relevant to clinical treatment, it is essential to consider the entire trajectory of life span development and the types of metacognition characteristic of mature adult development.

**Advanced Understanding of Mind**:

Wallin (2007) introduces the notion of tertiary subjectivity, where patients may transcend the constructed mind through practices of mindfulness to reach a direct, nonconceptual knowing of states of mind. However, this idea does not go far enough.

**Integral Theory**:

Ken Wilber's Integral theory articulates levels of knowing beyond constructivism and relativism, where all relative "maps" of mind reflect a transcendent "metamap" that accurately describes reality free of the limits of constructivism and relativism.

**Association of Each Level of Mind with Specific Types of Metacognition**:

Our contention is that each level of mind is associated with specific types of metacognition, and developing and strengthening these later-occurring levels of metacognition is more strongly related to coherence of mind and wellbeing than simply fostering reflective capacity. Patients' discoveries in this domain go beyond relativism into the domain of wisdom.

**Fourth Generation Metacognition**:

Integrating advanced metacognitive possibilities into the treatment of attachment and other disturbances heralds the fourth generation of the field of metacognition.

### The Spectrum of Adult Development
- Building upon Piaget's theory (1963) of child and adolescent intelligence, researchers have identified stages of mature adult development.
- These models extend beyond Piaget's last stage of formal operational thinking.

**Extensions of Piaget's Model**
- **Commons, Richards, and Kuhn (1982)**
  - Extended Piaget's model beyond formal operations.
  - Introduced systematic and metasystematic reasoning.
- **Loevinger and Wessler (1970) & Cook-Greuter (1990)**
  - Focused on ego development.
  - Identified stages beyond Piaget's formal operational thinking.
- **Kohlberg (1981)**
  - Studied moral development.
  - Described stages that go beyond formal operational thinking.
- **Kegan (1982)**
  - Explored self-development.
  - Identified stages of adult development.
- **Labouvie-Vief (1990)**
  - Focused on mature adulthood.
  - Described the characteristics and processes of this stage.
- **Sternberg (1984)**
  - Studied wisdom.
  - Introduced a new perspective on adult development.
- **Wilber (2000, 2007)**
  - Integrated various models into a full-spectrum model.
  - Included the highest stages of mature adult development from spiritual traditions.

**Postformal Reasoning (Commons, Richards, and Armon)**

**Stages of Postformal Reasoning**

- Collectively labeled as higher order thinking.
  - **First-order relations:** Relations between primary elements.
  - **Second-order relations:** Relations between relations.
  - **Third-order relations:** Advanced reasoning process (Commons, Richards and Armon, 1984).

- **Beyond formal operational thinking**: 
  - **Fifth-order (systematic) thinking**: complete and exhaustive operations between members of the same class.
  - **Sixth-order (metasystematic) thinking**: relationships between systems to define a supersystem.
  - **Seventh-order (cross-paradigmatic) thinking**: relationships between families of systems across independent fields.

**Adult Cognitive Development (Labouvie-Vief)**

- **Two postformal stages**: intersystemic and autonomous.
  - **Intersystemic stage**: expansion of context, awareness of meanings beyond information given.
  - **Autonomous stage**: logic of self-regulating systems, creativity and generativity across generations.

**Stages of Self-Development (Kegan)**

- Succession of qualitative differentiations of the self from the world.
  - Each stage: A more expanded context for the self.
  - In each successive stage, the self emerges from its embeddedness.

**Ken Wilber's Description of Kegan's Stages:**

- Changes involve the subject of one stage becoming the object of the next.
- Kegan's stages and corresponding Piagetian stages:
  * Incorporative self/sensorimotor (0)
  * Impulsive self/preoperations (1)
  * Imperial self/concrete operations (2)
  * Interpersonal self/early formal operations (3)
  * Institutional self/full formal operations (4)
  * Interindividual self (postformal thinking) (5)
- Later stages reflect self-in-relationship to broader contexts.

**Loevinger's Ego Development Model:**

- Ranges from presocial/symbiotic stage to integrated stage.
- Postformal stage is rare and hard to describe.

**Cook-Greuter's Descriptions of Postformal Stages:**

- **Individualist Stage (4/5):**
  - Awareness of importance of perspective, context, and point of view.
  - Truth seen as relative.
  - People realize they contribute meaning to external events.
  - Objects are human constructs.
- **Autonomous Stage (5):**
  - Operates fully from postformal thinking.
  - Cognitive functioning is metasystematic.
  - Individuals focus on discovering and actualizing potential.
  - Multiple frameworks of the self integrated into a coherent new theory.
- **Construct-Aware Post-Autonomous Stage (5/6):**
  - Awareness of linguistic bias in construction and distinction of objects.
  - Objects are inventions, arbitrary but useful for orientation.
  - Heightened awareness of mental habits as problematic.
  - Ego becomes aware of itself as an organizer and temporary construct.
  - Concepts seen as potentially effective but arbitrary codifications.
  - Desire to be liberated from bondage of rational thought.
  - Realization that self-identity is a temporary construct.
- **Universal or Unitive Stage (Stage 6)**
  - Change in concept of field, quantum leap in experience and outlook (Cook-Greuter, 1990)
  - Yearn to transcend rational, conscious egos (p. 92)
  - Direct attunement awareness instead of representational thinking (p. 94)
  - Immediate witnessing of ongoing process (1994, p. 133)
  - Global, transpersonal or ego-transcendent experience (p. 140)
  - **Characterized by**:
    * Multiperspectival capacity (p. 93)
    * No longer centered on the ego (p. 135)
    * Self is "No-'thing'" (p. 134)
    * Self is created anew at every moment (p. 138)
    * Beyond reified self-view (p. 138)

**Assumptions in Cook-Greuter's Stage Model of Ego Development**

- Individuals transcend limitations of representational thinking to direct awareness of ultimate truth (1994, p. 119)
- The more differentiated and objective self-view, the closer to truth one gets (p. 119)

**Integral Psychology and Integral Spirituality by Ken Wilber**

- Comprehensive model of multiple lines of human development
- Includes highest stages described in spiritual traditions
- Reviewed over 100 models of developmental sequences
- Found structural coherence reflecting universal framework for all developmental lines
- 12 bandwidths of light representing vibrational energies and structural stages

**Intellectual/Cognitive Line**

- Piaget's stages align with first five bandwidths
- Formal operational thinking corresponds to orange stage (fifth)
- First postformal cognitive stage is green, pluralistic or relativistic logic (sixth)

**Higher Cognitive Stages**

- **Teal**: systemic thinking and middle-vision logic (seventh)
- **Turquoise**: higher systemic thinking and late-vision logic (eighth)
- **Indigo**: global and ego-transcendent, awakened or illumined mind (ninth)
- **Violet**: all dimensions present simultaneously (tenth)
- **Ultraviolet and clear light**: highest attainments (eleventh and twelfth)

### Mindfulness and Awareness in Psychotherapy

* Mindfulness is a core skill in contemporary psychotherapies, particularly Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)
* Enhances patients' awareness of their internal state of mind
* Patients learn to be present to their experiences without reacting defensively
* Mindfulness meditation helps borderline and dissociative disorder patients develop continuous, nonreactive awareness
* Self-rating scales can help patients reflect on their degree of awareness
* Marking affective states is beneficial for patients with poor emotional awareness
* Therapist's perspective-taking and empathy help patients develop mentalization skills
* Mentalization fosters increased awareness of both self and others' state of mind

**Mindfulness in Psychotherapy**

* Patients become increasingly capable of observing their internal state of mind
* DBT incorporates mindfulness as a core skill
* Mindfulness meditation helps patients develop nonreactive awareness
* Learning to "be with" inner states can lead to explorations of meaning
* Self-rating scales help patients reflect on their degree of awareness

**Marking Affective States**

* Reinforcing patients' awareness of emotional states
* Verbal emphasis locates the experience within the patient
* Intensifiers mark emotions, making them more recognizable as internally felt states

**Mentalization and Perspective-taking**

* Important metacognitive skills lacking in patients with personality and dissociative disorders
* Therapist uses structured inquiry to help patients develop these skills
* Wondering about others' motivations, needs, feelings, and underlying beliefs models mentalizing for the patient
* Patients learn to wonder about their own and others' state of mind consistently and accurately over time

**Fostering Mentalization**

* Therapist's stance is crucial in fostering mentalization
* Wondering out loud about others' state of mind models mentalizing for the patient
* Repeating structured inquiry helps patients develop mentalizing skills
* Increasing curiosity towards one's own and others' state of mind accelerates the process.

### Metacognitive Monitoring

**Metacognitive Monitoring**

- Helping patients increase accuracy of self-assessment
- **Patients with poor self-assessment may exhibit various symptoms**:
  - Source-monitoring mistakes
  - Confusing fantasies or dreams with memories
  - Logical contradictions in beliefs
  - Passive influence
  - Serious lapses in reality-testing
  - Confusing inner speech with perceptions

**Fostering Objective Attitude**

- Encourage objective, scientific, critical attitude
- **Example**: Female patient's belief of husband abusing daughter
  * Patient had high suggestibility
  * Given feedback on risk of incorporating outside information
  * Encouraged to develop objective, critical attitude
  * Convinced no abuse occurred and worked out custody arrangement

**Positive Hallucinations**

- Nonpathological, highly hypnotizable subjects can create positive hallucinations
- Suspend reality-monitoring in hypnotic state

**Reality-Testing Deficits**

- **For patients reporting voices**:
  * Ask patient to estimate degree of external vs. internal perception
  * Explore source of voice
- Utilize inner-wisdom technique
  * Connect with inner wisdom for accurate detection of voice source

**Cognitive Dissonance Model of Treatment**

- Errors in monitoring contradictory and extremely irrational beliefs
- Introduce language of parts
  * **Belief**: Deceased abuser is still active in victim's mind
  * Conflict between part believing this is true and part knowing it is not true
  - Heighten dissonance between parts to resolve conflict
  - Shift away from extreme belief.

### Contingency Detection and Metacognitive Mastery

* Helping patients become aware of their states of mind is different from helping them become aware of their influence on those states (metacognitive mastery)
* Patients with personality and dissociative disorders have low awareness of contingency influence
* Therapist helps patients develop awareness of self-generated thoughts and actions affecting state of mind and behavior of others
* Explicitly introducing the task of gaining mastery over state of mind is necessary
* Hypnosis can be used with metaphor of an affect dial to help patients find range of intensity for greatest sense of control
* Patients are expected to increase control over internal states
* Displacement technique in hypnosis helps patients learn coping strategies from observing others

**Action Plans and Goal-Orientation**

* Development of formal operational thinking brings capacity for multiple possibilities and long-term goals
* Impulsive patients show impaired goal-oriented behavior
* Learning begins with reflecting on possible consequences of behavior as hypotheticals
* Patients are asked to imagine a series of possible reactions or responses, from less to more adaptive
* Negative consequences of maladaptive actions are explored in detail
* Patients are prompted to imagine healthy, adaptive responses and predict positive consequences
* Repeatedly asking patients to imagine consequences helps develop internal representations of actions and their likely consequences
* Impulsivity decreases as patients develop action plans and have successful goal completion experiences
* Patients learn to think proactively and let behaviors be guided by clear action plans.

### Meaning-Making

**Psychoanalytic Tradition and Meaning-Making**

* **Stern (2010)**: Therapy aims to help patients formulate the meaning of their inner experiences
* **Frank (1963)**: Symptoms ameliorated when a patient develops an explanatory model for symptoms
* **Dynamic therapy**: Helps patients make sense of experiences and symptoms
* Orientation towards explaining behavior, understanding internal antecedents, motivation, etc.

**Dynamic Therapy and Meaning-Making**

* Identify, formulate, and explain focal conflicts underlying experience
- **Manifest Meaning**
  * Understanding and explanation of immediate experiences
- **Emotional Meaning**
  * Reflects a deeper level than manifest meaning
  * Requires accurate identification of emotions and understanding of given meanings
- **Latent or Unconscious Meaning**
  * Identification and understanding repetitive behaviors and long-standing patterns
  * Fostering curiosity about underlying causes

**Intermediate Metacognitive Skills: Postformal Level (Stage 6)**

* Characterized by relativistic thinking and systematic operations
* **New metacognitive skills emerge, including**:
	+ Recognition of how the past shapes current experience
	+ Appreciation for the relativity of all states of mind and limitations of knowledge
	+ Capacity to see more deeply into underlying assumptions and expectancies
	+ Capacity to optimize action plans in the face of perceived limitations
	+ Capacity to appreciate effects of context on feelings and behaviors
	+ Capacity to take perspective

**Recognition of How the Past Shapes Current Experience**

* Dynamic therapists foster attitude towards exploring how early childhood behavior might have shaped current behavior
* **Rueful recognition**: acknowledging relationships between parental behavior and own behavior

**Appreciation for the Relativity of All States of Mind and Limitations of Knowledge**

* Help patients see that emotional states are just states, not absolute truths
* Encourage tentative constructions in meaning-making process
* Recognize defensiveness and self-deception around certain issues

**Seeing More Deeply Into Underlying Assumptions and Expectancies**

* Patients capable of understanding how underlying assumptions influence state of mind and behavior
* Therapist asks questions to help patients explore underlying beliefs and expectancies.

### Optimizing Action Plans

At the level of cognitive development in old age, individuals can optimize responses to perceived limitations through a process called selection, optimization, and compensation (SOC). This process is described by Baltes and Baltes (1990a, 1990b).

**Selection, Optimization, and Compensation (SOC)**

- **Selection**: Setting goals within the range of available coping resources.
- **Optimization**: Thorough exploration of hidden inner resources to establish the best forms of coping and functioning in the face of limitations.
- **Compensation**: Restructuring resources to minimize loss of functioning.

**Optimizing as a Metacognitive Skill**
1. Imagining a situation where one feels at their best (the "best self").
2. Identifying and reinforcing the qualities of the "best self."
3. Bringing those qualities into a difficult situation to experience it differently.
4. Discovering new inner coping resources.
5. Noticing the effect of the newly emerged quality on the experience of the difficult situation.
6. Developing an action plan using these optimizing resources for future coping.

### Sensitivity to Context
- People become increasingly aware of how the context of an experience affects their actual experience (Stage 6)
- Ability to understand how antecedent states impact state of mind and behavior
- Understanding that early childhood experiences and current behaviors of significant others should be considered in context
- Foster context-sensitivity by asking about the context within which a behavior or feeling occurred
- Encourage reflection on the relationship between context and experience
- Estimate the degree to which context affected the experience

**Capacity to Take Perspective**

- Understanding that all systems of knowledge are relative (Stage 6)
- Ability to see one's perspective as unique and relative
- Fostered by inquiries like "How do you see this, even if someone else might see it differently?"
- Developing a sense of self as a central organizing principle

**Advanced Metacognitive Skills: Later Postformal Levels (Stage 7)**

- Ability to relate a given system or systems to a wider system or supersystem
- Appreciation of the interdependence of elements within this wider system
- **New metacognitive skills emerge, including**:
  - The ability to take wider and wider perspectives
  - The ability to take past/present, self/other, and child/adult orientations
  - Awareness of the degree of organization or coherence of mind
  - An appreciation of interdependence
  - The ability to articulate a wider life purpose or ultimate concern and have an action plan of actualization
  - Freedom from internal contradiction

**The Ability to Take a Wider Perspective**

- Patients develop a coherent narrative for the self from early childhood to present (emerging transgenerational perspective)
- Therapist can help foster this process by helping patients see how their understanding might have changed over time and how different family members might hold different perspectives on the same event
- Perspective-taking is fostered by asking patients to take others' perspectives and look at themselves or others from those perspectives
- **Valuable method for enhancing perspective-taking and therapeutic process**: having patients try to take the therapist's perspective on their experience.

### The Ability to Develop an Orientation

**Orientation**

- Specific kind of perspective-taking
- **Two types**:
  * Past versus present orientation
    + Anxious-preoccupied patients are preoccupied with unresolved past experiences (past invades the present)
      - Therapist helps patient become more aware of their relative orientation to past and present
        * **Use anchoring scale**: "On a scale of 1 to 10, give me a number as to the relative orientation you have to past or present at this given moment"
    + Patients develop awareness of being stuck in the past and learn to shift to a more present orientation
  * Self versus other orientation
    + Narcissistically vulnerable patients lack balance between self and other perception
      - Therapist helps patient identify all-self/no-other or all-other/no-self perception
        * **Use anchoring scale**: "On a 1 to 10 scale, give me a number that best represents your relative awareness of state of self and state of other right now"
      - Patients learn to hold both states in mind simultaneously

**Awareness of Organization or Coherence of Mind**

- Patients with personality and dissociative disorders, as well as those with insecure attachment, experience low coherence of mind
- Coherence pertains to the relative perceived organization/disorganization of state of mind
- Patients benefit from learning to accurately perceive their organization of mind
  * **Use anchoring scale**: "On a 1 to 10 scale, give me a number that represents your level of organization and disorganization of mind right now"
- Patients learn to assess organization of mind and recognize how it's associated with specific mental states and external context
- Repeated use of interventions fosters increased metacognitive awareness and more consistent organization and coherence of mind

**Recognition of Interdependence**

- Patients develop a wider perspective recognizing interconnection and interdependence of all things and individuals
- Interconnection called "the implicate order" by physicist David Bohm
- Patients learn to appreciate the suffering of others through common humanity perspective
- Therapist encourages patients to develop a wider perspective through questions about interconnectedness and suffering

**Metacognitive Development of a Wider Perspective or Ultimate Concern, Action Plans of Actualization, and Freedom From Internal Obstacles**

- Patients develop metacognitive awareness and understanding of their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors
- **Develop ultimate concern**: a deep sense of purpose and meaning in life
- Create action plans for personal growth and actualization
- Overcome internal obstacles through self-awareness and reflection
- Use anchoring scales to increase awareness and develop skills for present orientation, self/other perception, organization of mind, and interdependence recognition.

### Contradiction

**The Psychology of Ultimate Concerns: Emmons' Findings**

* Individuals may have complex sets of personal strivings and goals that are contradictory, leading to diminished wellbeing. (Emmons, 1999)
* Developing higher-order goals or an ultimate concern can reduce internal conflict, increase subjective wellbeing, provide a sense of purpose, and enhance resilience.

**Developing an Ultimate Concern**

* Reflect on the central guiding principle of one's life.
* Identify core purpose behind actions with deepest meaning.
* Articulate details of ultimate meaning-system.
* Wider perspective or sense of purpose organizes specific goals and plans.

**Beyond Conceptual Thought: Stage 8 (Turquoise)**

* Discovers limitations of conceptual thought in favor of direct awareness.
* Direct awareness is an alternative, more valid means of knowing.
* Moving beyond conceptual thinking supports creativity and generativity.

**The Self as a Temporary Functional Organizing Principle: Stage 9 (Indigo)**

* Individual self is no longer experienced as solid or permanent.
* Serves as a functional structure to operate in the relative world.
* **Higher-order metacognitive skills develop, including**:
  * Developing multiple points of view free of contradiction.
  * Immediate awareness and automatic monitoring of ongoing processes.
  * Diminished reactivity to immediate experiences or states of mind.
* **Spacious freedom**: nonreactivity to problematic states.
* Cultivation and practice of intermediate skills reinforce higher-order metacognitive skills.

### Overview

**Metacognitive Capacity Development in Psychotherapy**

* Not every metacognitive capacity will be available to all patients in treatment due to varying developmental levels and structural foundations for cognitive and metacognitive functioning.
* **Individualized approach**: apply methods based on patient's problematic deficits.
	+ Limited ability to take perspectives other than one's own: perspective-widening methods.
	+ Poor mental organization: methods for increasing mental organization, such as the anchor scale.
* As patients progress and show fewer metacognitive deficits, introduce methods for later stages of cognitive development and higher metacognitive capacities.
* **Collaborative approach**: methods for cultivating metacognitive functioning are collaborative in nature.
* **Next chapter focus**: direct methods for enhancing collaborative capacity.
* Benefit for patients with attachment and personality disorders due to impaired collaborative skills.
* Contributes to efficient and stable treatment outcomes.

## Chapter 10 The Third Pillar Fostering Collaborative Capacity and Behavior

**The Importance of Collaborative Capacity**

* Securely attached patients exhibit collaborative behavior, which is essential for treatment.
* Cooperation and collaboration are hardwired in humans.
* Insecure attachment impairs the emergence of natural collaborative functioning.

**The Adaptive Function of Cooperative Behavior**

* According to Paul Gilbert (1989), cooperation evolved as an adaptive pattern for human species.
* Cooperation allows division of labor and joint, coordinated action to secure goals.
* Individualistic competitiveness is concerned with separating and differentiating individuals, while cooperativeness is about linking and joining them.
* Cooperative behavior is keyed to sharing, communication, and learning social rules for organizing role expectations in relationships.

**Maladaptive Effects of Lack of Cooperativeness**

* Lack of cooperativeness lies at the heart of many psychological difficulties.
* Includes tendencies to be overly competitive or submissive, fears of deception, and exploitation.

**Healthy Cooperative Behavior**

* Entails a sense of "togetherness" and mutuality.
* Reciprocation is essential for cooperative relationships.
* Status and worth are defined by altruism and contribution, not power.

**Human Infants vs. Apes: Cooperativeness**

* According to Michael Tomasello (2009), human infants display intrinsic altruism and cooperativeness.
* Human infants help, inform, and share with others from a young age.
* Shared intentionality is the underlying principle of human cooperation.

**Shared Intentionality**

* Involves creating joint intentions and commitments in cooperative endeavors.
* Structured by processes of joint attention and mutual knowledge.

**Human Infants' Cooperative Behavior**

* Display helping, informing, and sharing behaviors from an early age.
* Even infants below one year old distinguish helpful from unhelpful agents.
* Young children value conformity to the group.

**Conclusion**

* Collaborative capacity is essential for treatment due to its impact on attachment status and cooperative behavior.
* Cooperation evolved as an adaptive pattern in humans, allowing division of labor and joint action.
* Lack of cooperativeness can lead to various psychological difficulties.
* Human infants display intrinsic altruism and cooperativeness, which is based on shared intentionality.

### Collaborative Communication and Shared Intentionality

Tomasello (2009) defines collaboration as a mutualistic activity that goes beyond simple cooperativeness and includes shared intentionality. It involves joint goals, coordinated division of labor, and a shared focus of attention. Early humans developed skills and motivations for collaborative activities to survive and thrive.

**Skills and Motivations for Shared Intentionality**

- Collaboration is based on mutualism, where all parties benefit from cooperation but only if they work together.
- Collaborative activities require mutual responsiveness to each other's intentional states.
- Joint goals are essential in collaborative activities.
- Division of labor and understanding of each other's roles are necessary.
- Shared focus of attention is crucial.

**Collaboration in Human Development**

- Collaborative activities have been observed in human children from early ontogeny.
- Children form joint goals, establish domains of joint attention, and create symbolic institutional realities.
- Cooperation and collaborative communication coevolved.

**Cooperation and Collaboration in Children with Caregivers and Peers**

Secure infants have expectations that their caregiver will respond to their needs, while insecure infants do not. This is evident in experiments where secure and insecure infants react differently when their caregiver leaves them in distress.

- Securely attached infants look longer when the mother leaves but are comforted when she returns.
- Insecurely attached infants show less expectation of help from their caregiver.

In a daycare setting, nonabused children showed empathic concern towards distressed peers, while abused children did not. Heard et al. (2009) describe mutual interest-sharing as a behavioral system where participants are equals and interact about a specific topic to create a mutual interest.

**Clinical Relevance of Lack of Cooperation and Collaborativeness**

The lack of cooperation and collaborativeness in insecure and abused children is an aberration from normally expected development. These children show impaired nonverbal interactive behavior and noncollaborative verbal discourse, which tend to persist throughout older childhood and into adulthood. In attachment-based treatment, the therapeutic task is to provide corrective developmental conditions that allow patients to manifest their inherent collaborative potential.

### Defining Psychotherapy as Collaborative Partnership: The Contribution of Interpersonal Psychotherapy 

**Defining Psychotherapy as a Collaborative Partnership**

Harry Stack Sullivan's Contribution:
- Cooperation and collaboration are essential in psychotherapy (Sullivan, 1953)
- **Cooperation**: favoring shared goals over competition
- **Collaboration**: intersubjectivity, sensitivity to another person, mutual exploration
- Distinct from juvenile era habits of competition, cooperation, and compromise
- **Evolutionary perspective**: putting aside competition for shared interests and cooperative behavior

**Neo-Sullivanian or Interpersonal Psychotherapy**:
- Embodies both cooperative and collaborative elements

**Teyber & McClure's Definition** (Interpersonal Process in Therapy, 2011):
- Psychotherapy as a collaborative partnership
- Therapists and clients work together as partners
- Clear expectations for collaboration in the initial session
- Therapy is a shared interaction requiring participation from both parties

**Importance of Collaboration in Psychotherapy**:
- Applicable to all good psychotherapies, not just interpersonal
- Helping attachment-impaired patients become cooperative and collaborative
  - Beneficial for their lives outside therapy
  - Necessary for effective therapy process

**Fostering Collaboration at the Beginning of Therapy**:
- Focus on collaboration from the start to build a strong working alliance
- Articulate clear expectations for collaborative partnership
- Enact collaborative behavior in the initial session
- Therapy is not something therapists "do" to clients, but a shared experience.

### A MUTUALLY NEGOTIATED TREATMENT PLAN AND INFORMED CONSENT

**Collaborative Treatment in Therapy**

* **Beginning of collaboration**: exploration of patient's hopes and expectations
  * Patient identifies main problems for treatment
  * Hypothetical question about treatment success
* **Mutually negotiated treatment plan**
  * Shared expectations and information
  * Assessing important issues and concerns
  * Shared decision-making about best approach
* **Transparency on therapist's part**
  * Open discussion of diagnostic impressions

  * Discussion of anticipated difficulties in collaboration
* **Benefits of transparency**
  * Stronger alliance with patients
  * Modeling collaborative behavior
* **Importance of collaboration for treatment outcome**
  * Mutual exploration of treatment problems and goals
  * Defining shared understanding
* **Informed Consent**
  * Mutually developed, reviewed, and signed document
  * Explicit and tangible partnership agreement.

**Exploration of Patient's Hopes and Expectations**

* Collaborative process begins with patient's hopes and expectations
* Patient identifies main problems for treatment
* Asking hypothetical question about treatment success
  * Invites exploration and development of representation of treatment success
  * Reveals patient's unique perspective on treatment goals.

**Mutually Negotiated Treatment Plan**

* Shared expectations and information
* Assessing important issues and concerns
  * Past helpful and unhelpful experiences
* Shared decision-making about best approach
  * Collaborative partnership provides corrective emotional experience
* Transparency on therapist's part
  * Open discussion of diagnostic impressions
    * Arrived at through interview
  * Explanation of reasoning behind best approaches
  * Discussion of anticipated difficulties in collaboration.

**Benefits of Transparency**

* Stronger alliance with patients
* Modeling collaborative behavior
* Constitutes a new way of interacting for some clients.

**Importance of Collaboration for Treatment Outcome**

* Mutual exploration of treatment problems and goals
* Defining shared understanding
* Continuation of process crucial for successful outcome.

**Informed Consent**

* Mutually developed, reviewed, and signed document
* Explicit and tangible partnership agreement.

### ESTABLISHING THE TREATMENT FRAME AS COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP

- Patients with attachment disturbances have impaired collaborativeness and may withdraw or make excessive demands.
- A detailed treatment frame contract is necessary to solidify the expectation of therapy as a collaborative enterprise.
- The emphasis is on the negotiation and collaboration process, not the contract itself.
- Clear role expectations reduce misunderstandings and treatment ruptures.

**Establishing Safety Expectations**

- Dealing with safety issues sets the foundation for attachment-based treatment.
- Patients with attachment disturbances may view therapists as sources of danger.
- Treatment frame contract must include strategies for handling threats to patient's safety, such as self-harm, substance use, abusive relationships, etc.

**Collaborative Behavior and Therapy-Interfering Behaviors**

- Collaborative behavior is a goal throughout therapy.
- Treatment frame discussion must address how to handle therapy-interfering behaviors like lying, refusing to discuss certain topics, toxic behavior, etc.
- Open, honest disclosure and communication are essential for the therapeutic relationship.

**Consistency and Reliability**

- Expectations regarding consistency and reliability of both patient and therapist are addressed.
- Mutual understanding of how to handle potential disruptions like extended absences or decreased therapy frequency.

**Fostering a Collaborative State of Mind in Psychotherapy: The Contribution of the Rome**

- First few sessions occur before therapeutic relationship or attachment is established.
- Patients with attachment disturbances are sensitive to lack of attunement.
- Therapist must be more than task-focused, allowing for mutual negotiation and collaboration.

### CENTER OF COGNITIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY

**Center of Cognitive Psychotherapy (Rome) and Attachment Disturbances**

* Importance of fostering collaboration in psychotherapy for patients with attachment disturbances
* Cooperative behavioral system is an innate motivational system mediating cooperative behavior
* Superior cooperative and communicative abilities were key adaptations for early human groups to survive and prosper
* Cooperation allows individuals to feel safe and build relationships

**Fostering a Collaborative State of Mind in Patients with Attachment Disturbances**

* Deactivated in patients with significant attachment disturbance
* Important to foster collaborative state of mind from the first therapy session
* Foundation of safety and protection in therapy
* Explicit agreement of goals and rules of therapeutic work
* Mutual understanding is key to cooperation
* Ongoing dialogue between patient and therapist
* Collaborative exploration of treatment problems and goals
* Sharing information about treatment and progress
* Summary of main points at the end of each session
* Attachment-based treatment as a collaborative empiricism
* Promotes mentalizing ability

**Addressing Impaired Collaborative Behavior in Ongoing Therapy**

* **Two broad areas of impaired collaborative behavior**: nonverbal and verbal

**Nonverbal Collaborative Behavior**
* Synchronization in timing and match with the other's nonverbal behaviors in secure adult patients
* Desynchronization and mismatches common in adult patients with some pattern of insecure attachment
* Research by Beatrice Beebe

**Noncollaborative Verbal Behavior**
* Secure attachment on Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) indicated by healthy collaboration between interviewee and interviewer
* Individuals with insecure attachment rarely show collaborative verbal behavior on AAI
* Assessing collaborativeness through meeting or violating Grice's maxims
* Research by Mary Main

**Improving Collaborative Behavior Throughout Therapy**
* Focus on improving both nonverbal and verbal collaborative behavior
* Ruptures in therapeutic alliance require collaboration to explore and repair
* Switching to cooperative/collaborative mode outside of attachment system for efficient repair of the alliance
* Patient experiences therapist as attuned, responsive, and respectful

**Collaborative Exploration during Therapy**

* Collaborative exploration of therapeutic issues is different from traditional one-sided interpretation by the therapist
* Cooperation is better than interpretation
* Ongoing dialogue between patient and therapist fosters collaborativeness in treatment
* Mutual sharing of information about treatment problems and goals starts the process of collaborative exploration
* Dimaggio et al. recommend summarizing main points at the end of each session to foster collaborative exploration
* **Collaborative empiricism**: performing specific tasks based on jointly agreed goals
* Collaborative exploratory exchanges promote mentalizing ability

**Repairing Ruptures in Therapeutic Alliance**

* When ruptures occur, both patient and therapist must collaborate to explore and understand factors that led to the rupture
* Liotti recommends exploring negative representations and experiences not from within the attachment system but in a cooperative, collaborative mode
* Cooperative/collaborative behavioral system is distinct from the attachment system
* Through mutual peer-mode collaborative exploration of the rupture, beneficial distance or disidentification from the rupture occurs, allowing for efficient repair of the therapeutic alliance
* Process strengthens the attachment relationship as patient experiences therapist as attuned, responsive, and respectful.

### IMPROVING NONVERBAL COLLABORATION

Beebe and Lachmann (2014) emphasize the importance of understanding early interaction disturbances in therapy through research on nonverbal collaboration between patients and therapists. This research can help:

- Increase awareness of interactive mismatches in nonverbal behavior
- Create "model scenes" to capture current disturbances
- Become more empathetic towards patients' dilemmas by recognizing parallel processes in our own histories

**Three Prototypical Patterns of Insecure Attachment**

1. **Secure Attachment**:
   - Collaborative nonverbal exchanges
   - Reciprocal influence and high coordination
   - Contingent behaviors leading to positive affective intensity
   - Child develops a sense of effectance and agency

2. **Insecure Attachment**:
   - Contradictory, or noncollaborative, mutual nonverbal exchanges
   - Significant and repetitive mismatches
   - Uncoordinated and desynchronized interactions
   - Lack of contingent behaviors and heightened negative affect
   - Child develops dysfunctional patterns of reciprocal exchange and lack of effectance

**Research on Nonverbal Collaboration between Infants and Caregivers**

Beebe and her associates:

- Microanalyzed videotapes of infant–mother interactions to understand nonverbal relatedness
- **Discovered two broad types of dyadic nonverbal exchanges**: 
  - **Collaborative exchanges** lead to positive affective intensity and well-organized patterns of interaction
  - **Contradictory exchanges** result in dysfunctional patterns and lack of effectance

**Transforming Nonverbal Interactions through Therapy**

Beebe and her colleagues have influenced our thinking and methods for fostering nonverbal collaborativeness by:

- Providing mothers with direct visual feedback to learn healthy patterns of exchange
- Using video microanalysis to investigate nonverbal patterns between adult patients and therapists.

**Developing Healthy Nonverbal Collaboration in Insecurely Attached Adult Patients**

**Step 1: Establishing a Nonverbal Secure Base**

- Therapist's nonverbal cues must show continuous, undivided attention and engagement.
- Position, head orientation, body posture, stillness, gaze, facial affect display, rhythm, pitch, tone, and timing of verbal responses should be adjusted to match the patient.
- Avoid patterns of nonverbal distancing (e.g., distractedness), hyperengaging, or mismatching the patient's behavior.

**Step 2: Observing Main Patterns of Nonverbal Exchange**

**For both patient and therapist**:

1. **Chair position and posture**: Distance between chairs, facing each other or side by side, leaning, slumping, looming, etc. (Indicates overall level of engagement.)
2. **Head orientation**: Forward or sideways, looking straight ahead or elsewhere, cocked to one side. (Salient indicators of attention and interest.)
3. **Gaze**: Directly at or away, at an angle, averted, looking at something else.
4. **Facial affective display**: Smiling, mock surprise, surprised face, woe face, positive/disinterested attention, distress face, angry-protest face, joyful face, crying, comforting face. (Primary importance in contingent matching of affect and attunement.)
5. **Initiated self-touch**: Touching one's own skin or objects, clothing, chair, hair. (Clues to engagement in self-regulation.)
6. **Postural gestures**: Postural shifts, head nodding/shaking, rubbing feet/hands, jiggling legs, folding/crossing arms/legs, tucking face into chin, making hand gestures, coughing, blowing nose. (Indicate interactive regulation and self-regulation.)
7. **Breathing**: Synchronized or desynchronized, shallow or deep, holding breath, yawning, sighing. (Signs of synchronization, disruption, and self-regulation.)
8. **Vocal rhythm**: Volume, length of silences, timing and synchronization, interruptions, slowness/rapidity, emphasis on "uh-huhs."
9. **Vocal tone**: Clarity in communicating emotion via voice, melody.
10. **Vocal pitch**: Positive emotion indicated by rising pitch, negative emotion by falling pitch.

**Task for the therapist**:

- Observe salient and repetitive patterns of nonverbal exchange between patient and therapist.
- Be aware of both patient's and therapist's nonverbal behaviors.
- **Some patterns may be obvious (e.g., dismissing attachment**: stonewall facial expression, extended silences), while others may occur for fractions of a second and operate outside awareness.
- Maintain heightened presence and awareness to effectively address nonverbal communication.

**Patient Nonverbal Patterns**:

- **Dismissing attachment**: Sits back in chair, moves chair away, infrequent head/gaze orientation towards therapist, frequent averted gaze, stonewall facial expression or off-putting facial displays, attenuated spontaneous postural displays, defensive postural displays (hand-folding), noninteractive self-regulatory behaviors (yawning, extended silences, curtailed vocalizations), soft/barely audible voice with descending pitch.
- **Anxious-preoccupied attachment**: Sits forward in chair or looms, sits too close, hypervigilant fixed stare, frequent facial displays of distress, exaggerated spontaneous postural displays, plaintive postural displays, high postural anxiety (rubbing hands/feet, jiggling legs), inability to remain silent or take turns in vocalization, very fast vocal rhythm, making vocalizations over therapist, descending pitch.
- **Disorganized attachment**: Contradictory mixture of dismissing and anxious-preoccupied nonverbal behaviors.

**Step 1**: Identification of Salient and Repetitive Nonverbal Patterns

- Identify dysfunctional nonverbal patterns in patient's communication
- **Determine main attachment pattern**: secure, dismissing, anxious-preoccupied, or disorganized
- Focus on specific dysfunctional nonverbal exchange patterns for therapy

**Step 2**: Transform Dysfunctional Nonverbal Exchange Patterns through Nonverbal Engagement

- Match and change activity
- Respond to patient's nonverbal communication with purposeful behavior
- **Example**: Dolores's lack of eye contact, body posture, inaudibility, still-face reaction
- Use video footage for mutual review and learning

**Step 3**: Transform Dysfunctional Nonverbal Exchange Patterns through Enhancing Metacognitive Awareness

- Collaboratively share observations on salient nonverbal behaviors
- Set context for intervention with patient's permission
- Increase patient's awareness of dysfunctional patterns in therapy and outside it
- Decrease dysfunctional patterns, increase healthy communication and collaboration

**Method for Addressing Dysfunctional Nonverbal Behaviors**

1. **Metacognitive Awareness**: Patient becomes aware of specific nonverbal behaviors and their associated emotions or arousal states.
2. **Experiential Focusing**: Patient explores bodily felt sense of nonverbal behavior, identifying its function (self-regulation, interactive regulation, or both).
3. **Direct Change Experiment**: Patient attempts to change nonverbal behavior to something more collaborative and focuses on the resulting felt sense.
4. **Feedback and Reflection**: Therapist provides feedback on the effectiveness of changes and encourages verbalization of emotional states.
5. **Meaning-Making**: Historical context and meaning of dysfunctional nonverbal patterns are explored, leading to co-constructed interpretations.
6. **Cumulative Effects**:
   * Patient learns about the contingent effect of nonverbal behaviors on therapist's response and vice versa.
   * New pattern of mutual match-and-change affective displays emerges.
   * Heightened positive affective moments between patient and therapist develop a secure therapeutic base.
   * Nonverbal disconnection diminishes, and repair becomes easier.
   * Patient develops new preverbal schemas for healthy, collaborative nonverbal exchanges with others.
   * Enhanced sense of being seen, known, and contingently matched by the therapist.

**Key Concepts**:

- **Metacognitive Awareness**: Understanding one's own thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.
- **Experiential Focusing**: A therapeutic technique for becoming aware of bodily felt senses.
- **Self-regulation**: Managing one's internal states to cope with emotional or physiological responses.
- **Interactive Regulation**: Adjusting nonverbal behavior to influence the therapist's response.
- **Nonverbal Collaboration**: Mutual understanding and effective communication through nonverbal cues.
- **Co-constructed Interpretations**: Meaning is created collaboratively between patient and therapist.
- **Contingent Effect**: The impact of one person's behavior on another's response.
- **Preverbal Schemas**: Mental frameworks for understanding experiences before the development of language.

### IMPROVING VERBAL COLLABORATION

**Origins of Verbal Collaborative Behavior**

- **Human communication is a cooperative enterprise (Tomasello, 2010) based on**:
  - Mutually assumed common conceptual ground
  - Mutually assumed cooperative communicative motives
- Shared intentionality is necessary for collaborative activities
- Cooperative communication evolved from nonverbal pointing and pantomiming in apes
- Human verbal communication adds collaboration to nonverbal behaviors
- **Three basic human communicative motives**: requesting, informing, sharing attitudes

**Collaborative Verbal Communication**

- Emerged as part of the evolution of humans' unique forms of collaborative activity
- Developed in the context of daily collaborative routines between child and parent
- Central to this process is the development of grammatical conventions
  - Grammar of requesting
  - Grammar of informing
  - Grammar of sharing

**Grice's Maxims (Structure of Verbal Collaborative Behavior)**

- **Cooperative principle**: speaker implicates intended meaning, and listener inquires to understand
- Four maxims fundamental to collaborative discourse
  1. **Quality**: accurate, genuine, main points illustrated with evidence
  2. **Quantity**: right amount of information about shared topic
  3. **Relevance**: content stays close to referential intention and topic
  4. **Manner**: clear and unambiguous

**Politeness in Conversation (Leech, 1983)**

- Six politeness standards or maxims
  1. **Tactful communication**: minimizes cost, maximizes benefit to others
  2. **Generous communication**: minimizes benefit to self, maximizes benefit to others
  3. **Approbation**: minimizes dispraise, maximizes praise and enhancement of others
  4. **Modest communication**: minimizes praise to self, maximizes praise to others
  5. **Agreement**: minimizes disagreement, maximizes common interests and agreement
  6. **Sympathetic communication**: minimizes antipathy, maximizes listening to the needs of the other
- Positive opposite of toxic verbal communication

**Failure of Collaborative Verbal Communication in Adults with Insecure Attachment (Sullivan)**

- Harry Stack Sullivan articulated the failure of collaborative verbal communication in certain psychiatric patients
- Individuals with insecure attachment may struggle to engage in effective collaborative verbal communication.

**Communicative Difficulties and the Importance of Collaborative Verbal Communication**

* Miscommunication arises when words do not convey intended meaning, leading to misunderstandings (1953, p. 184)
* Early Sullivanian therapists emphasized enhancing collaborative verbal communication in treatment
* Clear, meaningful, and collaborative verbal communication is essential for effective interpersonal relationships

**The Importance of Honest Feedback in Therapy**

* When a patient says something that doesn't make sense, it should be an explicit focus in therapy (DB's experience with Dr. Alfred Stanton)
* Giving honest feedback about unclear communication helps patients learn interpersonal communication skills

**Types of Failures in Collaborative Verbal Communication: Insights from the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)**

* Mary Main and her associates studied various types of failures in collaborative verbal communication among adults with different attachment styles
* **Grice's four maxims of collaborative speech**: truthful quality, adequate quantity, relevance, and clear manner of expression

**Secure Individuals vs. Insecure Individuals on the AAI**

* Secure individuals exemplify collaborative verbal behavior, adhering to Grice's maxims
* Insecure individuals (dismissing, anxious-preoccupied, disorganized) show various types of noncollaborative verbal behavior

**Dismissing Insecure Individuals**

* **Violate quality maxim**: overgeneralizations, untruthful or contradictory examples, succinct descriptions, and positive idealization
* Intellectualized and remote from feelings
* Avoid conflict but use noncollaborative behaviors when it's unavoidable

**Anxious-Preoccupied Insecure Individuals**

* **Violate relevance, quantity, and manner maxims**: wandering off topic, adding excessive information, vague and ambiguous statements
* Highly anxious or angry speech during conflict
* Characterized by excessive verbal demands, complaining, blaming, and playing the victim role

**Disorganized Insecure Individuals**

* **Violate all four maxims**: confusing and contradictory speech, disorganized and incoherent communication, shifting dissociative states

**Collaborative Verbal Communication in Everyday Life and Psychotherapy**

* Collaborative verbal discourse is marked by appropriate turn-taking, reflective listening, validating feelings and perspectives, sharing information, curiosity, clarification, and co-constructing new meaning
* Securely attached individuals talk openly, patiently, and clearly in therapy, taking responsibility for their own limitations and remaining open to different perspectives
* Dismissing patients talk too little, often idealizing speech and avoiding conflict
* Anxious-preoccupied patients talk too much, interrupting, perseverating on topics, and demanding excessive attention
* Disorganized patients exhibit a confusing mixture of dismissing and anxious-preoccupied behaviors, with disorganized and incoherent speech and shifting dissociative states.

### A Model for Collaborative Dialogue in Treatment

* Developed by Karlen Lyons-Ruth and Boston Change Process Study Group based on observations of infant-caregiver interactions (1999)
* Focuses on facilitating developmental change through collaborative dialogue
* Communication from insecurely attached patients is often nonverbal or implicit, requiring representation in therapy

**Collaborative Dialogue**

* Patient and therapist engage in a two-person dialogue with a focus on developing collaborative forms of dialogue
* Careful attention to the other's intersubjective experience
* Open acceptance of a broad range of affects
* Active scaffolding to more inclusive levels of dialogue
* Engaged struggle and negotiation during periods of change
* **Outcome**: coherent communication

**Eleven Steps for Establishing Collaborative Verbal Communication in Insecurely Attached Patients**

1. **Establish a verbal secure base**:
   * Consistent reflective listening and validation by therapist
   * **Three elements of reflective listening**:
     1. Mirroring back the gist of what was said (manifest content)
     2. Reflecting back the affective meaning
     3. Mirroring back the latent meaning
   * Validation renders legitimacy to patient's experiences
2. **Consistent therapist stance**:
   * Mutual exchange and collaboration through verbal exchange is important, welcome, and beneficial
3. **Explicit ground rules of verbal discourse**:
   * Make explicit the rules of collaborative verbal dialogue for insecurely attached patients
   * Encourage full disclosure and following basic rules of psychotherapy (saying whatever comes to mind)
   * Address issues like long silences, speaking softly, or not following the rules of verbal communication
4. **Active listening**:
   * Listen attentively and reflect back what was heard
   * Encourage patient's self-reflection
5. **Emotional regulation**:
   * Help patients regulate their emotions during therapy sessions
   * Validate emotions and help them understand the emotional significance of their experiences
6. **Repair ruptures**:
   * Address misunderstandings or disagreements between patient and therapist
   * Repair any negative interactions that may occur
7. **Establish new levels of awareness**:
   * Help patients gain insight into their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors
   * Encourage exploration of unconscious processes
8. **Brokering the process of change**:
   * Facilitate the patient's understanding of the therapeutic process
   * Help them navigate the challenges and transitions during therapy
9. **Address attachment injuries**:
   * Address past attachment injuries and their impact on current relationships
   * Help patients develop new ways of relating and healing from these injuries
10. **Explore relational patterns**:
    * Identify and address maladaptive relational patterns
    * Encourage the development of more adaptive relational patterns
11. **Consolidate gains**:
    * Help patients consolidate their therapeutic gains
    * Encourage the application of new skills and insights in daily life

These steps aim to activate the cooperative/collaborative communication system in patients with insecure attachment, leading to a more effective therapeutic process.

**Strategies for Soft-Spoken Patients**:

* **Use nonverbal signals when speech is inaudible**: raising hand or using metaphors like low audio volume.
* Help patient develop metacognitive awareness of soft speech and turn-taking rules.
* Ask about past experiences with listening and engagement.

**Turn-Taking and Interruptions**:

* Teach patients to pause, wait for a response, and resume speaking when appropriate.
* Use nonverbal signals (hand raising or T-symbol) or verbal signals (timer tone) for interruptions.
* Encourage patient to point out therapist's interruptions.

**Metacognitive Inquiries**:

* Explore how patients know they are being heard and what indicates listening.
* Support co-creation of a mutually satisfying connection.

**Rules for Verbal Exchange**:

* Make it permissible for the patient to admit not knowing or misunderstanding.
* Encourage patients to ask questions when unsure.
* Model collaborative communication by asking for clarification.

**Observing and Addressing Problematic Patterns**:

* Observe and list problematic patterns of verbal exchange with the patient.
* Identify most salient and repetitive dysfunctional patterns.
* Target specific dysfunctional patterns for intervention.
* Determine or validate attachment pattern from descriptions in AAI scoring manual.

**Attachment-Based Therapy for Dismissing and Preoccupied Patients**

**Dismissing Patients**:

* Normal capacity for exploration except around attachment themes
* Encourage exploration of attachment themes
* Overly succinct and unemotional discourse
* Therapist expresses interest, gives feedback, and invites patient to describe underlying emotional experience
* Idealize attachment figures and put positive spin on negative experiences
* Validate positive dimension of early childhood relationships
* Encourage exploration of full range of early attachment experiences, including negative ones
* Mark any affect that appears during exploration

**Interaction with Dismissing Patients**:

* Express interest in patient's discourse
* Invite patient to describe underlying emotional experience
* Validate positive aspects of early childhood relationships
* Encourage exploration of negative experiences
* Mark and acknowledge any affect that emerges

**Preoccupied Patients**:

* Speak on and on, wander off topic
* Use "stop-action technique" to promote exploration from felt experience
* Fear losing contact without ongoing speaking
* Encourage recognition of pauses, silence, and internal reflection as strengthening connection
* Exploratory behavioral system is deactivated
* Vague, ambiguous, or unclear discourse requires experiential focusing and clear description
* Undeveloped sense of self, overly concerned about other's state of mind
* **Use methods to direct focus onto self**: anchoring scale and redirecting attention/affective marking

**Interaction with Preoccupied Patients**:

* Use "stop-action technique" to promote exploration from felt experience
* Build patient's ability to bring attention to internal states
* Encourage greater self-awareness and reflection
* Use anchoring scale to direct focus onto self
* Redirect attention and mark affect during exploration of past experiences

**Anchoring Scale**:

* On a scale of 1 to 10, indicate the orientation of focus between self and other in the moment
* Helps patients bring attention to internal states and supports greater self-awareness

**Redirecting Attention and Affective Marking**:

* Redirect patient's attention to their own feelings during exploration of past experiences
* Mark affect that emerges during exploration to deepen understanding of emotional experience.

**Step 7: Identifying and Modifying Toxic Noncollaborative Verbal Behavior**

* **Dismissing Patient**:
  * **Toxic verbal behavior**: derogation, invalidation, ultimatums, aggressive threats (themes of devaluation and toxic shaming)
  * Therapist gives immediate feedback and explores attachment themes
  * **Co-construct positive opposite**: "I deeply value the depth of my connection with you"
* **Preoccupied Patient**:
  * **Toxic verbal behavior**: excessive blaming of self and others, excessive demands, self-defeating thinking, overreaction, frequent mind-reading
  * Therapist gives immediate feedback and explores attachment themes
  * **Co-construct positive opposite**:
    * Correct imbalanced focus on other to internal self-experience
    * Create healthy need statements
    * Imagine making healthy need requests and receiving appreciation instead of blame

**Step 8: Therapist's Verbal Match-and-Change**

* **Dismissing Patient**:
  * Mirror succinct speech and develop it in greater detail
  * Mirror positive aspect and inquire into negative aspects
  * Reflectively mirror content and mark underlying feeling
* **Preoccupied Patient**:
  * Call for pause and reflect back succinct summary of main point
  * Request brief summary of main point when wandering off topic
  * Request clearer communication when vague or ambiguous
  * Explicitly request "best-fit" words if violations in manner are severe

**Additional Technique**:

* **Patients benefit from learning Leech's (1983) six maxims of politeness**: tact, generosity, approbation, modesty, agreement, and sympathy.
* Patients can create experiences of others manifesting these verbal qualities toward them in imagination.

**Step 9: Enhancing Verbal Contingency Communication and Dialogue**

- Patients with insecure attachment need to see the effect of their verbal communication on others.
- Reflective listening and mirroring by the therapist is the first step in showing the patient that their communication has had an effect.
- Therapist gives feedback on the immediate effect of the patient's communication on their state of mind.
- Feedback can be given nonverbally or verbally, showing emotional impact or expressing thoughts that arose from the patient's communication.
- Frequent naming of the effects helps the patient understand the contingency between their words and the therapist's response.

**Step 10: Enhancing Patient's Metacognitive Awareness of Violations in Discourse**

- Therapist addresses violations in quality, quantity, and relevance of speech.
- Asking questions to increase patient's awareness of the impact of their communication on the therapist.
- Helping patients stay on topic and be aware of irrelevancies.

**Step 11: Collaborative Co-constructed Meaning-making**

- Focuses on content of verbal discourse, helping patients effectively communicate their primary referential intention.
- Therapist inquires, asks for clarification, mirrors back, adds new insights, and develops a back-and-forth interaction.
- Co-created meaning-making starts with current states of mind and situations, later evolving into a coherent life narrative.

**Signs of Successful Activation of the Collaborative Behavioral System**

- Nonverbal behaviors become matched, synchronized, and contingently effective.
- Verbal communication follows normal rules of collaborative discourse.
- Verbal communication is sensible and meaningful, following Grice's maxims with few violations.
- Verbal communication is coherent, scoring 7 to 9 on the AAI.
- Verbal communication is contingently effective on the listener.
- Accurate, ongoing metacognitive monitoring of lapses in verbal discourse.

**Outcomes of Successful Treatment**

- Healthy nonverbal and verbal communication within and outside treatment context.
- Capacity for healthy, meaningful, coherent, and contingently effective communication.
- Direct experience of the benefits and rewards of healthy nonverbal and verbal communication with others.
- Overcoming developmental arrest of the collaborative behavioral system.
- Getting back on the right developmental track toward ongoing contingent, collaborative behavior with others.
- Continued healthy exploration and attainment of higher stages of adult cognitive and emotional development.

### Case Illustration

**Case Illustration: John's Therapy Session**

**Background**
- John, a man in his 30s, presented for therapy with symptoms of depression and low self-esteem.
- Assessed as having a mixed attachment style, predominantly anxious-preoccupied with some dismissing features.
- In this excerpt, John describes a work situation with a co-worker/friend, "Jake," where they had difficulty collaborating on a project.

**Communication Challenges**
- John's rapid speech and fading sentence endings made it difficult for the therapist to understand him.
- The therapist asked John to slow down his speech and pay attention to how he finished sentences.

**Work Situation**
- John felt frustrated with Jake, who seemed dismissive of his ideas and critical in their interactions.
- They had conflict and struggled to communicate effectively, which hindered their ability to work together on the project.

**Therapist's Approach**
- The therapist acknowledged John's communication challenges and provided feedback in a collaborative manner.
- She pointed out nonverbal behaviors that were unclear and asked for clarification.
- She encouraged John to translate his nonverbal signals into clear, collaborative comments.

**Collaborative Communication**
- The therapist maintained a positive, collaborative engagement throughout the session.
- She highlighted the importance of effective communication in enhancing understanding between John and Jake.
- This process helped increase John's metacognitive awareness of his communication patterns.

**Key Points**
- John presented for therapy with symptoms of depression and low self-esteem, and was assessed as having a mixed attachment style.
- During a session discussing a work situation with a co-worker, the therapist noticed John's rapid speech and fading sentence endings made it difficult to understand him.
- The therapist asked John to slow down his speech and pay attention to how he finished sentences for better communication.
- John described conflict and difficulty collaborating with his co-worker, Jake.
- The therapist provided feedback on John's nonverbal behaviors and encouraged him to translate them into clear, collaborative comments.
- The therapist maintained a positive, collaborative engagement throughout the session and emphasized the importance of effective communication in enhancing understanding between John and Jake.

## PART IV TYPE-SPECIFIC TREATMENT 
### Application of The Three Pillars Treatment To Dismissing, Anxious-Preoccupied, and Disorganized Attachment

The following sections detail how to apply the Three Pillars Treatment to each insecure attachment type, with considerations based on their unique developmental care-receiving experiences.

**1. Dismissing Attachment**

* **Developmental care-receiving experiences**: Minimization of emotional needs and neglect or rejection by caregivers.
* **Tailoring the Three Pillars**:
  * **Secure Base**: Focus on building a secure therapeutic relationship, providing validation and empathy.
  * **Safe Haven**: Offer a safe space for emotional expression, allowing the patient to explore feelings and experiences.
  * **Selective Attunement**: Use reflective listening and empathic responses to help the patient understand their emotions and needs.

**2. Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment**

* **Developmental care-receiving experiences**: Overstimulation, inconsistent care, or emotional over-involvement from caregivers.
* **Tailoring the Three Pillars**:
  * **Secure Base**: Establish a consistent and predictable therapeutic relationship, offering reassurance and stability.
  * **Safe Haven**: Provide a calming environment to help regulate emotions and reduce anxiety.
  * **Selective Attunement**: Use empathic responses and active listening to validate the patient's feelings and experiences.

**3. Disorganized Attachment**

* **Developmental care-receiving experiences**: Exposure to traumatic or chaotic environments, inconsistent or contradictory care from caregivers.
* **Tailoring the Three Pillars**:
  * **Secure Base**: Create a safe and predictable therapeutic relationship, offering emotional support and stability.
  * **Safe Haven**: Provide a calming environment to help regulate emotions and promote safety.
  * **Selective Attunement**: Use empathic responses and active listening to help the patient process complex emotions and experiences.

**General Considerations**

* Treatment is individualized for each patient, not their attachment type.
* Understanding the specific developmental care-receiving experiences of each insecure attachment type guides tailored treatment approaches.
* The Three Pillars of treatment (Secure Base, Safe Haven, and Selective Attunement) are adapted to meet the unique needs of patients with Dismissing, Anxious-Preoccupied, and Disorganized Attachment styles.

## Chapter 11 Treating Dismissing Attachment 
**Origins of Dismissing Attachment**

* Ainsworth et al. (1978) identified repeated maternal rejection as the origin of avoidant attachment in children.
* Mothers of avoidant children were described as especially rejecting, particularly in response to physical contact and proximity-seeking behaviors.
* Rejection communication included direct and indirect expressions of negative affect and behavior.
* Avoidant children often failed to show collaborative nonverbal behavior and experienced chronic frustration due to rebuffed attachment behaviors.

**Impact on Child Development**

* Main and Weston (1981) confirmed that repeated rejection is related to the development of avoidant attachment in children.
* Mothers of avoidant children were less emotionally expressive than mothers of secure or other types of insecurely attached children.
* Haft and Slade (1989) found that dismissing mothers misattuned to their babies' negative-affective displays, especially when directed toward them.
* Grossmann's study observed that avoidant infants experienced friendly attention mostly when playing by themselves or showing positive emotions but were left alone during negative emotions.
* Belsky (1999) reported that mothers of avoidant children tend to be more controlling and rigid than mothers of secure or other insecurely attached children.

**Therapeutic Stance with the Dismissing Patient**

* Dismissing patients are underrepresented in clinical settings and rarely seek treatment for relational issues.
* When they do present, their attachment system is largely deactivated.
* Therapists must consistently engage dismissing patients by repeatedly and actively guiding, prompting, and supporting attachment-oriented behaviors.
* Careful, accurate attunement to patient-initiated instances of proximity-seeking, verbal expressions of felt needs, and negative affects is essential.
* Permissive encouragement of exploration of past and current attachment experiences, including the treatment relationship, is necessary.
* Supporting the emergence and experience of negative affect related to attachment is crucial.
* Encouraging free exploration of self in the context of attachment relationships orients the normally developed exploratory system toward attachment themes and experience, contributing to reactivation of the attachment system.

### Using Ideal Parent Figure Imagery With the Dismissing Patient

**Ideal Parent Figure (IPF) imagery** is an effective approach for working with dismissing patients during the early stages of treatment. It allows for consistent attachment-themed sessions while providing relational distance from the therapist. The focus is on self-generated imagery rather than the immediate relationship between patient and therapist, making it less threatening to dismissing patients.

**Benefits of IPF Imagery**:

* Structures treatment sessions around attachment themes
* Allows for relational distance from the therapist
* Acceptable to dismissing patients due to their unrealistic idealization of parents
* Transforms unrealistic idealization into a healthy internal working model for secure attachment

**Challenges with IPF Imagery**:

* Patients may feel bewilderment or threat when suggested to revisit childhood attachment themes
* **Therapist addresses these feelings and helps patients realize what's missing**: a positive representation of secure attachment
* Collaborative approach engages the patient in developing a positive map as a shared goal of treatment

**Regulating Closeness/Distance**:

* For dismissing patients unable to tolerate proximity with IPFs, imagery can include closeness/distance regulation
* Patient experiments with finding just the right distance from IPFs in their imagination
* Provides experience that patient can control closeness/distance according to need
* Reassures patient of therapist's respect for their needs throughout treatment

**Considerations when working with IPF Imagery**:

1. Shaping IPF imagery elements to positively remap IWMs of attachment
2. Tailoring IPF imagery to suit the particular dismissing patient

**Key Elements of IPF Imagery**:

* Deeply accepting and encouraging of child's attachment behavior and expressions
* Warmth and open affection when patient wants to be with them
* Never uncomfortable with physical or emotional closeness

**Addressing Patient Reactions**:

* When patient expresses bewilderment, therapist helps identify missing sense of early attachment as a positive, secure base
* When patient becomes fearful, therapist acknowledges fear and indicates they will work together to understand why attachment is perceived as a source of threat.

**Secure Attachment**: The goal is to transform the approach/avoidance conflict regarding attachment needs into a stable, positive representation of parent figures who are deeply accepting and encouraging of the child's attachment needs. This results in a conflict-free experience of secure attachment.

**Imagery**: The imagery is shaped to help the patient imagine ideal parents (IPFs) who are attuned to the full range of emotional experience and expression of the patient. IPFs are not only carefully attuned but also contingently responsive to negative emotions, especially underlying vulnerabilities, hurts, and disappointments.

**Dismissing Patients**: For dismissing patients, it is particularly important that the imagery includes IPFs recognizing and encouraging the identification and expression of these deeper emotional themes. The therapist introduces scenes where IPFs have recognized an uncomfortable state in the child and encourage the child to identify, express, and explore that state directly to the ideal parents.

**Qualities of IPFs**: IPFs are suggested to have qualities that are the positive opposite of rigid and controlling – openness, flexibility, and permissiveness. The objective is to help the dismissing patient positively remap their internal working models (IWMs) in the direction of expecting flexible, open, and permissive responses from others.

**General Considerations**: parental presence, consistency, reliability, and interest – and the five primary behavioral conditions that promote secure attachment – protection, attunement, soothing, expressed delight, and fostering best self-development – there are particular ways of introducing these concepts to dismissing patients.

**Protection**: The therapist suggests parent figures who provide protection specifically in the attachment relationship, as this idea is especially alien to most dismissing patients. IPFs are presented as dedicated to protecting the patient from harm and attuned to their needs for security and safety in their connection with them.

**Attunement**: The IPF imagery for dismissing patients emphasizes parents who are especially attuned to physical and emotional proximity-and contact-seeking, and also especially attuned to the child's range of negative emotional expressions. This contributes to the development of positive representations and expectancies of others being comfortable with and encouraging physical and emotional closeness and a wide range of negative as well as positive affects.

**Examples**: IPFs are described as parents who notice when the patient wants to be close, welcome warm hugs and emotional closeness, recognize and accept negative emotions, and stay attuned even when the patient is angry or uncomfortable with them. They know that children sometimes feel not-so-positive feelings toward their parents and it's okay for these feelings to be expressed to them.

**Soothing**:

* The therapist suggests scenes in which the child is emotionally upset and IPFs are consistently responsive, providing soothing, comfort, and reassurance.
* **Objective**: Develop a stable, positive representation and set of expectancies that others are openly comforting and comfort is expected and seen as normal.
* **Example**: Parents tune in to the child's emotional state and find ways to soothe effectively.

**Expressed Delight**:

* Caregivers of dismissing patients typically lacked expression of delight or selectively expressed it only around independence.
* Imagery is suggested to support the experience of IPFs expressing delight about the child's emotional expressions and wish for emotional and physical closeness.
* **Example**: Parents are delighted when the child wants to be close and welcome all feelings.

**Fostering Best Self-Development**:

* Early childhood caregivers of dismissing patients reinforced a strong, independent self by selectively attuning to and supporting independent exploratory behavior.
* **Objective**: Develop a positive representation and set of expectancies that others can provide a secure base for exploration.
* **Example**: Parents are there for the child during exploration and reconnection.

**Individualizing IPF Protocol**:

* If an Attachment Anxious Adult Interview (AAI) is available, use positive opposites of adjectives or phrases given to describe early parental relationships.
* If an AAI transcript is not available, use information from unstructured clinical interviewing.
* Important to translate idealized and unrealistic portrayals into genuine positive opposites.

**Soothing**:

* Lacking specific memories or incidents illustrating "loving," the positive opposite becomes "deeply physically affectionate."
* "Orderly routines" lacked a sense of closeness, the positive opposite is "savoring moments together."
* "Doing fun stuff" meant instrumental love, the positive opposite is "just being together and not having to do anything."
* "Concerned" showed overinvolvement, the positive opposite becomes "always attuned to your needs and feelings."
* "Helpful" illustrated pressure to succeed, the positive opposite used in IPF protocol is "deeply attuned to your needs and feelings."

**Expressed Delight**:

* "Around a lot" lacked indication of father's attunement, the positive opposite for IPF imagery becomes "carefully attuned to your needs and feelings."
* "Plays with me" depicted playing for the child rather than with them, the positive opposite is "enhancing sense of self."
* "Strong" involved affectionate caress followed by hard slap, the positive opposite used in IPF protocol is "trusting your longings."
* "Caring" lacked spontaneity or fun, the positive opposite becomes "the fun of just being together and not doing anything."
* "Learning" involved making sure homework was finished but no real help, the positive opposite becomes "fostering joy of discovering and learning."

### Fostering Collaboration in the Dismissing Patient

**Engaging Cooperative Behavioral System**

- Dismissing patients resist active engagement towards attachment themes
- Therapist focuses on engaging cooperative behavioral system for collaboration
- Patient's strong, autonomous self is effective in life endeavors
- Introduce therapist and patient as a team with shared goals
- **Foundation of treatment**: both patient and therapist need to show up emotionally
- Exploration in therapy is within the context of a relationship
- Initial emphasis on cooperative aspects of relationship
- Uses IPF imagery to avoid resistance to attachment

**Addressing Nonverbal Behaviors**

- Dismissing patients exhibit noncollaborative nonverbal behaviors
- Therapist uses patient's metacognitive awareness to help identify and explore these behaviors
- Experiential focusing can be used to identify state of mind associated with nonverbal gesture
- Focus on contingently matching and transforming dismissive patient's affective facial displays

**Addressing Verbal Behaviors**

- Dismissing adults violate Grice's maxim of truthful quality and quantity in discourse about attachment themes
- Therapist calls attention to overly positive, lacking illustrative evidence descriptions and succinct speech
- Encourages patient to explore state of mind at time of verbal behaviors for underlying emotions, memories, assumptions, and maladaptive schemas

**Overall Goals**

- Foster verbal collaborativeness and dialogue
- Dismissing patient becomes openly expressive and freshly exploratory about attachment themes
- Significant mismatches in nonverbal communication become focus of treatment
- Therapist places much focus on contingently matching and transforming dismissive patient's spontaneous affective facial displays.

### Enhancing Metacognitive Skills in the Dismissing Patient

**Metacognitive Skills in Dismissing Patients**

* Therapist's consistent stance of reflecting on the patient's mind contributes to metacognitive skills development and mentalizing capacity (Allen, 2001, 2013)
* Specific techniques like affect marking and experiential focusing are effective

**Metacognitive Identification of Internal States**

* Dismissing patients have poor awareness of internal states
* Use of anchoring scales can enhance patient's capacity to estimate their degree of awareness (1-10 scale)
* Scales show dismissing patients how little they are aware of their inner state, supporting exploration and development

**Exploration of Underlying Affects, Vulnerabilities, Memories, and Maladaptive Schemas**

* Dismissing patients resist accessing negative and positive affects, especially in relation to attachment experience
* Encourage patients to look beyond surface-level experience to deeper levels
* Use affect dial technique to promote staying with resisted states
* Patients learn to identify specific emotions and experience them fully

**Experiential Focusing**

* Helps dismissing patients become aware of states of mind associated with nonverbal noncollaborative communication
* Encourages holistic awareness of immediate experience and felt sense in the body
* Systematic steps help patients identify, understand, and verbally express emotions in attachment relationship context

**Marked Affectivity and Contingent Responsiveness**

* Important metacognitive techniques for developing reflective capacity in patients with personality disorders
* **Marked affectivity**: therapist mirrors patient's affect using a verbal intensifier and locates it as central experience of self
* Encourages metacognitive identification of state of mind and fosters awareness of contingent responsiveness

**Metacognitive Awareness of Context**

* Dismissing patients have poor awareness of contingency effects
* Encourage patients to take a wider perspective and reflect on how contextual factors contribute to parental rejection or discomfort with affection
* Patients recognize negative ways they have become like their parents and develop rueful recognition
* Later in treatment, encourage patients to articulate a central guiding purpose or ultimate concern for renewed purpose and interdependence.

### Stages in the Treatment of the Dismissing Patient

1. **Introducing Cooperative Behavior and Reactivating Attachment System**:
   - Therapist introduces concept of cooperative behavior as a way to work on attachment system reactivation indirectly.
   - Early therapeutic work involves systematic use of Interpersonal Process Recall (IPF) imagery and addressing nonverbal and verbal misattunements.
   - Encouraging metacognitive awareness at the moment of misattunements.
   - Dismissing patients, particularly those classified as Ds3, long for relationship connection despite defenses against it.
   - Longing for closeness may cause distress and conflict, accompanied by anxiety, sadness, shame, and vulnerability.

2. **Normalizing the Longing**:
   - Movement from avoidant or fearful to secure attachment involves ambivalence.
   - Therapist should normalize longing for physical and emotional closeness as natural and positive.
   - Use of normalizing interventions to counteract profound toxic shame associated with basic longings.
   - IPF imagery focuses on accepting, soothing parent figures responding to child's longing and discomfort.
3. **Signs of Attachment System Reactivation**:
   - Nonconflicted reports of physical and emotional proximity-seeking between child and IPFs.
   - Preference for using IPF imagery.
   - Spontaneous comments about preferring to be in therapist's presence.
   - Emergence of healthy protest behavior at therapist's unavailability.
   - Therapeutic ruptures are likely due to the previously deactivated attachment relationship with the therapist.
   - Collaborative metacognitive inquiry into both patient and therapist states of mind associated with treatment rupture is beneficial.
4. **Middle to Late Stages of Treatment**:
   - Dismissing patient capable of using therapist as a secure base and acknowledging healthy dependence.
   - Focus on exploration of secure intimacy, not early childhood attachment themes.
   - Use of ideal partner imagery to develop stable, positive map for adult secure intimacy.
   - Ideal intimate partners provide safety, responsiveness, secure base, safe haven, contingent responsiveness, comfort, and encouragement of self-development within the context of intimacy.

### Case Illustration

**Case Illustration: Dismissing Attachment Style of an Adult Patient**

* Successful businessman in his early 50s with a dismissing attachment style (Ds3)
* Married and divorced after a short-term relationship, remained remote from feelings
* Came out as gay but never had intimate relationships, hired gay escorts for cuddling
* Initially sought treatment for being overweight and developed chronic low self-esteem
* First treatment focused on enhancing self-esteem and mastery over binge eating
* After a year, patient lost weight and resolved chronic low self-esteem issues
* Terminated treatment after therapist suggested addressing absence of close relationships
* Returned two years later due to weight gain and diabetes diagnosis

**Second Treatment: Ideal Parent Figure (IPF) Imagery**

* Second session of the second treatment
* Patient reported patterns of emotional eating during the week
* Introduced IPF imagery in the first session, focusing on "the way these ideal parents are being with the child that leads to a sense of feeling absolutely secure in the attachment relationship"

**Patient's Expressions**

* **Independent and autonomous**: "I tried to use the IPF imagery on my own during the week."
* **Dismissing attitude towards emotions**: "I don't really feel like I need it [IPF imagery] that much."
* **Minimizing the importance of attachment**: "It's not a big deal, I can handle it on my own."

**Therapist's Interventions and Observations**

* **Validating patient's feelings**: "You've been able to manage your eating patterns quite well since our last session. It sounds like you're feeling pretty good about yourself."
* **Encouraging exploration of emotions**: "It's understandable that you might feel a bit uncomfortable exploring your emotions, but it can be helpful in understanding how they relate to your eating patterns."
* **Normalizing the importance of attachment**: "Having close relationships and feeling securely attached to others is an important part of being human. It's not a sign of weakness or vulnerability, but rather a strength that can help us navigate life's challenges."
* **Reframing IPF imagery**: "Instead of thinking of the ideal parents as external figures, you could also imagine them as aspects of yourself that provide comfort and security when needed. This can help make the imagery more accessible and effective for you."
* **Encouraging mindfulness**: "Being aware of your thoughts and feelings in the present moment can help you respond to emotional triggers in a healthier way, rather than turning to food as a coping mechanism."
* **Normalizing the process**: "It's important to remember that developing a strong attachment relationship with yourself and others takes time and effort. It's not something that will happen overnight, but with consistent practice and dedication, it can lead to significant improvements in your overall well-being."

**Therapy Session**
The following text is a transcript of a therapy session between a therapist and a patient discussing the patient's emotional eating habits and attachment issues. The therapist encourages the patient to identify and understand their state of mind, specifically regarding their discomfort with seeking emotional closeness in the therapeutic relationship.

**Patient's Discomfort with Seeking Emotional Closeness**:

- The patient uses ideal parent figures to comfort themselves when emotionally eating but feels uncomfortable with this behavior during therapy sessions.
- They are metacognitively aware of their discomfort, which is limited to the therapeutic context.
- The patient experiences an approach/avoidance conflict regarding contact-seeking and feels actual anger when the therapist tries to get closer.
- They find being seen or having someone be interested in them uncomfortable and unnatural, leading to feelings of vulnerability and fear rather than comfort.

**Exploring Positive Attachment**:

- The therapist encourages the patient to imagine a quality of how ideal parents could have been with them that would make them prefer closeness and feel comfortable.
- The patient struggles to generate positive imagery around proximity-seeking, showing metacognitive awareness of their resistance to attachment.
- They eventually shift the focus to observing their daughter's relationship with her children as a model for positive parental behavior.
- The therapist encourages the patient to imagine themselves in a similar situation, being the center of attention and valued by ideal parents.

**Session 1**:

* Patient shares an imagery exercise about being in a park with IPFs who seek closeness without threatening (positive proximity-seeking)
* Therapist asks about the quality of how IPFs are being with the patient that helps them want the closeness
* Patient describes feeling enveloped in their arms and being happy and silly
* Therapist introduces the concept of positive expectancy about responsiveness of IPFs
* Patient shows metacognitive awareness of unresponsiveness of family-of-origin parents in contrast to responsive IPFs
* Patient feels drained after the session

**Session 2**:

* Patient discusses feeling embarrassed during a business meeting for showing feelings and fears it might have jeopardized the negotiation
* Patient gains weight due to overeating and mindless eating while reading
* Therapist fosters metacognitive awareness of state of mind and attachment needs
* Patient shows metacognitive awareness of relating variables, making a connection between lingering and filling void of attachment needs
* Patient deactivates attachment by compensating with the illusion of self-sufficiency
* Therapist fosters exploration of state of mind in a collaborative relationship
* Patient expresses discomfort with imagining tenderness and support from others

**Session 3**:

* Patient discusses their struggle with overeating and mindless eating during reading
* Patient shows metacognitive awareness of relating variables, discovering a connection between binge eating and longing for connection
* Therapist introduces positive IPF imagery around the theme of emotional closeness
* Patient is reluctant to imagine tenderness and support from others at their current age.

**Treating a Patient with Dismissing Attachment: Case Illustration**

The following case illustrates the main features of treating a patient with dismissing attachment style using imagery of ideal parent figures (IPFs) and persistent active engagement from the therapist.

**Patient's Experience**:

1. The therapist asks the patient to imagine the conditions under which they could allow themselves to feel a loving, tender connection.
2. The patient experiences discomfort and finds it hard to imagine emotional closeness.
3. The therapist encourages the patient to put themselves in a calm and relaxed state and imagine being with ideal parents who are ideally suited to them.
4. The patient concedes that feeling physically and emotionally close to IPFs is associated with positive emotions.
5. The therapist asks which form of visualization the patient feels more secure in, and the patient chooses the childhood scene.
6. The patient imagines being with ideal parents, laughing and feeling secure in the relationship.
7. The therapist reinforces the positive connections with IPFs over lingering with food.
8. The patient shows signs of reactivating the attachment system and experiencing a positive representation of immediate physical and emotional proximity with IPFs as deeply satisfying and conflict-free.

**Therapist's Approach**:

1. **Persistent active engagement**: The therapist maintains an active stance, even when the patient protests or attempts to deactivate attachment behavior in the treatment.
2. **Imagery of ideal parent figures**: The therapist uses IPF imagery to help the patient develop a new, positive internal working model (IWM) of attachment.
3. **Metacognitive identification**: The therapist fosters the patient's awareness of their own thoughts and feelings regarding attachment closeness.
4. **Joint collaboration**: The therapist collaborates with the patient toward therapeutic goals.

**Observable Changes**:

1. Recognition of attachment longings as a source of security and satisfaction, not threat or shame.
2. Development of a new, positive IWM that includes comfort with physical closeness.
3. Increased comfort in being deeply seen and known.
4. Increased comfort with soft, gentle emotions within oneself.
5. Comfort with spontaneous, playful exploration in the context of secure attachment.
6. Early signs of normalization of attachment longings.

**Summary**:

This case illustration demonstrates how treating a patient with dismissing attachment style involves persistent active engagement from the therapist, imagery of ideal parent figures, and metacognitive identification to help the patient develop a new, positive IWM of attachment. The patient shows early signs of reactivating the attachment system and experiencing the representation of immediate physical and emotional proximity with IPFs as deeply positive and conflict-free.

## Chapter 12 Treating Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment

**Origins of Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment**

* Developed from various forms of maternal unresponsiveness (Ainsworth et al., 1978; Belsky, 1999b; Mikulincer et al., 2003; Shaver & Mikulincer, 2009)
* Mothers were inconsistent and unpredictable in responding to infants' signals of distress
* Poor timing of responsiveness and partial attention due to multitasking
* Inconsistent responsiveness was a significant factor in the development of anxious preoccupation
* Selective misattunement, particularly to infant's exploratory initiatives and expressions of exuberance
* Mothers often showed anxiety during caregiving and spilled their own anxieties onto infants

**Origins in Childhood**

* Caregiver allows child to become overinvolved in the caregiver's state of mind (Main & Weston, 1981)
* Reverses healthy, balanced parenting pattern
* Interferes with child's development of emotion regulation and self-development
* Leaves anxious-preoccupied adult with poor self-development, impaired reflective capacity, and vulnerability to chronic anxiety/anger

**Therapeutic Stance with Anxious-Preoccupied Patient**

* Consistent focus on patient's own state of mind and self-experience
* Reverse the patient's outside-in orientation to an inside-out orientation
* Collaborate with patient to turn focus from therapist's state of mind to their own
* Consistently attuned and responsive to moment-by-moment shifting affective states (vitality affects)
* Be fully present, moment to moment, in sessions
* Limited self-disclosure to avoid reactivating patient's hyperactivating style within the transference
* Self-disclosure should serve to orient patient more carefully toward their own state of mind during ruptures of therapeutic alliance.

**Working with Anxious-Preoccupied Patients**:

1. **Therapeutic Stance**:
   * **Avoid selective attunement to fear states**: Therapist should not overly focus on patient's fears and worries, as caregivers of anxious-preoccupied adults may have done.
   * **Become a consistently calming presence**: Therapist remains unflappable and calm, providing comfort and reassurance.
   * **Use imagery of a protective bubble**: Patient imagines a safe, clear, protective bubble to help regulate closeness-distance.
2. **Closeness-Distance Regulation**:
   * Focus on regulation in the context of hyperactivation of attachment system.
   * Collaboratively explore how close patient needs to be and how much distance can be tolerated using protective bubble imagery.
3. **Selective Attunement to Exploratory Behavior**:
   * Therapist mirrors and encourages self-exploration and development.
   * Use direct inquiry to prompt exploration and reinforce self-development.
4. **Ideal Parent Figure (IPF) Imagery**:
   * Anxious-preoccupied patients find it easier to use IPF imagery due to dissatisfactions with family-of-origin parents.
   * Introducing IPF imagery may invoke feelings of threat and abandonment fear, requiring therapist explanation and reassurance.
   * Emphasize pervasively attuned and accurately contingently responsive ideal parent figures.
5. **Working with Ideal Parent Figure Imagery**:
   * Freshly co-create IPF imagery in each session to cultivate spontaneity.
   * Introduce themes consistent with research on attachment and tailor IPF imagery for the particular patient.

**Imagery therapy (IPF) focuses on attunement between patient-as-child and ideal parent figures (IPFs)**

* IPFs are attuned to the child's states, attachment initiatives, and emotional expressions.
* Patients experience their internal state being recognized, accepted, and responded to appropriately by IPFs.
* IPFs address patients' experiences of caregivers overly involving them in their states of mind.
* IPFs are consistently attuned to the child's anxiety levels and provide soothing and reassurance.
* Patients learn to relax hypervigilance towards IPFs' states and experiences.
* IPFs accept and comfort patients when they fear disconnection or abandonment, reducing excessive attachment behavior.
* Therapist suggests focusing on escalating abandonment threats to experience the IPFs' effective responses.
* Therapist avoids self-reference during sessions to reinforce inside-out orientation in anxious-preoccupied patients.
* Affective marking of inner states enhances inside-out orientation and validates patient experiences.
* Patients imagine scenarios involving brief separations and reunions with IPFs for sensitivity to separations and reunion episodes.

**Imagery Therapy (IPF)**:

* Focuses on attunement between patient-as-child and ideal parent figures (IPFs).
* IPFs are openly and accurately responsive to the child's states, attachment initiatives, and emotional expressions.
* Patients experience internal state recognition, acceptance, and appropriate responses from IPFs.

**Addressing Overly Involved Caregivers**:

* IPFs are attuned to patients' anxiety levels and provide soothing and reassurance.
* Patients learn to relax hypervigilance towards IPFs' states and experiences.

**Excessive Attachment Behavior**:

* IPFs accept and comfort patients when they fear disconnection or abandonment.
* Patients move away from excessive attachment behavior, such as anxious clinging or attempts to control IPFs' responses.

**Interventions**:

* Focusing on escalating abandonment threats to experience IPFs' effective responses.
* Therapist avoids self-reference during sessions.
* Affective marking of inner states enhances inside-out orientation and validates patient experiences.

**Scenarios Involving Separations and Reunions**:

* Patients imagine scenarios involving brief separations and reunions with IPFs for sensitivity to separations and reunion episodes.

**Working with IPF (Ideal Parent Figure) Imagery for Anxious-Preoccupied Patients**

IPF imagery is a therapeutic technique used to promote attachment security and improve skills in closeness/distance regulation and emotion regulation for anxious-preoccupied patients. 

This technique is based on the five primary parental behavioral conditions that promote secure attachment: **protection**, **attunement**, **soothing**, **expressed delight**, and **fostering best self-development**.

**Protection and Safety**
- Anxious-preoccupied patients are markedly fearful and have a generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder diagnosis.
- Introducing parent figures who are expressly protective and provide a stable safe haven contributes to positive remapping of attachment figures as an expected source of safety and protection.

**Attunement**
- Childhood ambivalent/resistant attachment is associated with significantly more pervasive caregiver misattunement than other attachment prototypes, especially regarding exploratory behavior.
- IPF imagery is shaped to provide the patient with experiences of careful, accurate attunement to his or her behaviors, inner states, and developmental capacities.

**Soothing and Comfort**
- Anxious and/or angry arousal is a prominent feature of preoccupied attachment.
- The therapist emphasizes IPF qualities of soothing, comforting, and reassurance to help the patient develop a stable representation and set of expectancies that others can be openly comforting and demonstrate that hyperactivated attachment behaviors are unnecessary.

**Expressed Delight**
- In anxious-preoccupied patients, the experience of caregivers’ expressed delight is especially missing with respect to spontaneous exploratory behavior.
- The therapist suggests that parent figures openly express their delight and pleasure regarding the patient's actions of spontaneous exploration, initiatives toward discovery, and attempts to be strong, autonomous, and independent.

**Fostering Best Self-Development**
- Anxious-preoccupied patients show a lifelong pattern of inhibited self-development.
- The therapist specifically emphasizes that the parent figures are entirely comfortable with, deeply supportive of, and strongly confident about the child's initiatives of exploration and discovery.
- Parent figures are present in ways that foster the development of the patient's best and most unique self.

**Tailoring IPF Imagery to the Particular Patient**
- The therapist uses the five adjectives from the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) or information from unstructured clinical interviewing to tailor the IPF imagery to the particular patient.
- Adjectives given for the early childhood relationship with the mother and father are translated into their positive opposite qualities based on the explanatory examples given by the patient in response to AAI inquiries about the adjectives.
- The ideal mother and father figures embody these translated qualities, providing the patient with experiences specific to what was most missing in the family of origin.

### Fostering Collaboration in Anxious-Preoccupied Patients

Anxious-preoccupied patients are characterized by excessive self-disclosure, easy crying, and attuned nonverbal behavior, but these behaviors do not necessarily indicate collaborative behavior. Instead, they represent strategies for pleasing the therapist and an outside-in orientation.

**Self-Disclosure**: Anxious-preoccupied patients often self-disclose excessively as a sign of compliance with what they presume the therapist wants. The therapist should acknowledge the disclosure but redirect the focus to the patient's experience underlying it.

**Example Interchange**:
- **Patient**: I’m really worried about whether you will be able to help me or understand me at all, so I want you to really know what’s on my mind. I know I’m the kind of person who can be a real pain in the ass. I’m always so nervous and afraid and on edge. God! I just can’t slow my mind down for a second. I worry about my son and his drinking, and I worry about my mother . . . she’s getting up there, you know . . . and my daughter keeps losing one job after another . . . I’m probably gonna have to give her money again.
- **Therapist**: I appreciate you letting me in on a lot of your worries, but I wonder if you could tell me what it’s like for you to be so concerned for everyone else so much of the time . . . It sounds exhausting!

**Crying**: Frequent crying should not be assumed to be a positive sign of emotional release and relief. Instead, it is likely an indication of hyperactivation of the attachment system and abandonment fear. The therapist should address the underlying fear directly.

Example Interchange:
- **Patient**: And then I didn’t hear back even though I sent a bunch of texts and I know she never goes anywhere without her phone and always checks it every five minutes . . . [Punctuated with an angry tone, and crying and sobbing]
- **Therapist**: Obviously we can’t know what’s going on with her, so let’s look at your feelings . . . do you think your anger and tears are only about her behavior, or is there something there about a deeper fear of being alone and abandoned?

**Nonverbal Behavior**: Anxious-preoccupied patients have one-sided nonverbal attunement designed to read and extract cues in an effort to infer the therapist’s expectations and state of mind. The therapist must transform this into a moment-by-moment nonverbal collaborative dialogue.

**Goals of Therapy**: The primary goal of therapy with an anxious-preoccupied patient is dampening the hyperactivated attachment system. The therapist and patient work together to understand and tolerate abandonment and separation fears and associated hyperactivation of attachment behaviors.

**Verbal Behavior**: Anxious-preoccupied patients are verbally noncollaborative, talking on and on without pauses or providing opportunities for turn-taking. The therapist should highlight the patient's failure to follow basic rules of verbal collaborative dialogue and help them learn to frame discourse in terms of succinct meaningful units.

**Example Interchange**:
- **Patient**: The thing is, I don’t know . . . I know I’m an adult-child so that makes a difference, I guess; I am so codependent, too, so that doesn’t help either—it just gets me so upset when I know things could be better between us, but I don’t understand why it always becomes an argument.
- **Therapist**: I know you’re saying a lot, but I am confused about what you actually mean. If you don’t worry about labels like codependent or adult-child, perhaps you can try again to explain the point you’re trying to make.
- **Patient**: Okay, well I guess I am just trying to say that there must be something about me and the way I react that is part of the problem in my relationship, and I want to understand what it is.
- **Therapist**: That is much clearer and more direct. I think we can definitely explore what you contribute to the relationship that’s not helpful.

### Enhancing Metacognitive Skills in Anxious-Preoccupied Patients

Anxious-preoccupied patients, as identified by low reflective capacity scores on the Reflective Functioning Scale (RF-S), require specific methods to enhance their metacognitive skills. The following are key strategies for therapists working with anxious-preoccupied patients:

**Therapist's Consistent Mentalizing Stance**:

* Important in offsetting patient's hypervigilant overinvolvement in the state of mind of others
* Helps maintain a consistent focus on the patient's internal experience

**Condition-Specific Approach**:

* Target specific metacognitive skill deficiencies
* Address deficit in identifying own state of mind

**Marking Patient's Affect**:

* Contributes to patient's identification of affect experience
* Helps patient realize that affect is their own and not originating outside
* Verbal marking comments locate self as the locus of affect

**Metacognitive Mastery during Fear of Abandonment**:

* Patients lose capacity for metacognitive mastery during fear of abandonment
* Therapist brings metacognitive focus to relativity of all states
* Helps patient determine effective action strategies

**Action Strategies**:

* Teach patients to anticipate outcomes and consequences
* Develop careful action plans
* Organize behaviors around these action plans

**Postformal Metacognitive Skills**:

* Address maladaptive schemas of emotional deprivation and abandonment
* Use emotion-focused techniques from schema therapy
* Bring underlying assumptions and expectancies into patient's awareness

**Metacognitive Awareness of Organization or Coherence of Mind**:

* Recognize low coherence in preoccupied patient's discourse
* Use simple anchoring scale to enhance metacognitive awareness
* Consistently use the scale across sessions for improved organization and coherence

**Metacognitive Awareness of Orientation**:

* Utilize anchoring scales to improve metacognitive ability to develop orientation
* Address past/present oscillations with a 1-10 scale
* Gradually help patient learn to maintain current, here-and-now orientation
* Use anchoring scale for self/other focus to reduce preoccupation with other's state of mind and enhance awareness of own state.

Ultimately, the goal is for anxious-preoccupied patients to develop the capacity to hold both self and other states of mind at the same time, facilitating collaborative exchange and exploration.

### Stages in the Treatment of the Anxious-Preoccupied Patient

1. **Initially**:
   * Therapist introduces cooperative behavior as a way to temper attachment system hyperactivation and reactivate exploratory behavior.
   * Systematic use of IPF (Ideal Parent Figure) imagery.
   * Emphasis on noninvolving parent figures who attune carefully and consistently to the patient's state of mind.
   * Parent figures in imagery soothe, comfort, and reassure the child to lower anxious arousal and temper hyperactivated attachment behavior.
2. **Middle Stage**:
   * Focus on episodes of hyperactivated attachment behavior in therapeutic relationship.
   * Ruptures in therapy relationship due to empathic failures or heightened abandonment fear.
   * Patient becomes excessively demanding of proximity and contact-seeking, or attempts to control therapist's responsiveness.
   * Therapist calls upon cooperative behavioral system to address ruptures or threats collaboratively.
   * Shared metacognitive exploration to identify and understand patient's state of mind during hyperactivated attachment episodes.
   * Repairing therapeutic ruptures reactivates attachment system and supports emerging sense of trust and security.
3. **Middle to Late Stages**:
   * Enhancing self-development and self-esteem, especially the emergence of a healthy exploratory system.
   * Therapist serves as secure base for self-exploration.
   * Reduction in frequency and degree of hyperactivation of attachment behavior.
   * Diminished preoccupation with past hurts.
   * Maintaining here-and-now state-of-mind focus.
   * Balanced focus on state of mind of both self and other.
   * Reactivation of exploratory system.
   * Capacity to sustain self-exploration without hyperactivation of attachment behavior is the strongest indicator of progress.
4. **Later Stages**:
   * Developing a positive IWM (Internal Working Model) for secure intimacy.
   * Imagery of ideal intimate partners who meet conditions of secure intimacy.
   * Qualities from earlier IPF imagery and qualities important for anxious-preoccupied patients, such as noninvolving, accurate attunement, providing a secure base, and encouraging self-development within the context of intimacy.
   * **Objective**: Anxious-preoccupied patient develops a stable, positive map for adult secure intimacy that guides current and future relationships.

### Case Illustration

**Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment Pattern with Helen**

* **Background**: Helen, a woman in her 30s, had a history of psychiatric hospitalizations and various diagnoses including bipolar II disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, borderline personality disorder, panic disorder, and dissociative disorder not otherwise specified. She had taken seven overdoses of prescription medications without suicidal intent but to escape unbearable agitation.
* **Attachment Classification**: Helen's Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) produced an insecure attachment classification of CC/E3/Ds1, indicating a mixed strategy with the anxious-preoccupied pattern as predominant and some dismissing features. Her pre-treatment AAI coherence was 2.0 out of 9.
* **Treatment**: Helen underwent three years of treatment using the Three Pillars method, which resulted in a secure attachment classification (F5) with some preoccupied features post-treatment and an increased coherence score of 8.0 out of 9, as well as improved reflective functioning from a 2 to a 5.
* **Relational History**: Helen's earliest memory was of her father when her mother was hospitalized, leaving her feeling abandoned and unable to connect with babysitters. She had difficulty falling asleep when her parents were away or when her mother was working from home. When her mother died, Helen kept her injury a secret due to fear of burdening her parents. Her mother's emotional expression was overwhelming for Helen, while her father was unemotional but practical. Helen became nearly phobic of being hugged and felt there were family secrets she couldn't discuss with her parents. In high school, undiagnosed bipolar disorder caused erratic behavior and passive coping, leading to overdosing and hospitalization.
* **Therapy Experience**: Helen had difficulty describing her experiences effectively due to passivity and painful shyness. She began taking over-the-counter medications and exhibited signs of dissociation during therapy sessions. The warm nurse's hugs were comforting but confusing, leading to tears and shame. Endings of therapy sessions evoked feelings of being alone and unprotected, increasing interpersonal intensity and resulting in fear and sadness.
* **Impact of Treatment**: The Three Pillars method led to significant improvements for Helen, including a secure attachment classification, increased coherence score, and improved reflective functioning. These changes represent a marked improvement for this patient with a complex psychiatric history and attachment pattern.

### Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) 

**Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) and Patient's Background**

- Patient, Helen, sought DBT treatment due to emotional regulation difficulties and interpersonal communication style issues.
- Impressive initial improvement in DBT but felt invalidated during therapy.
- Manifested preoccupied attachment patterns, fixated on therapist's personal details and lost internal focus.
- Therapist's questioning about suicidal ideation set up outside-in orientation, leading to more suicide thoughts.
- Use of self-disclosure by therapist to rebuild alliance hyperactivated Helen's anxious-preoccupied attachment pattern.

**Underlying Issues and Transition to Attachment-Focused Therapy**

- Frustration and sense of stuckness for both patient and therapist.
- Arrangement for attachment-focused consultation to address underlying issues.
- Decision to move on to attachment-focused treatment in the next stage.

**Attachment-Focused Therapy Transcripts**

**Transcript 1: Middle State of Treatment**

*Helen talks about taking a professional competency exam after completing advanced training.*

**Therapist Interventions and Observations (IPF segments)**

- Utilized adjectives given by Helen to describe her relationships with mother and father.
  - *Reactive, sensitive, moody, sad, and distant for mother figure.*
  - *Serious, hardworking, demanding, protective, and playful for father figure.*
- Applied positive opposites of these adjectives to each respective ideal parent figure.
  - *Highly responsive, sturdy, consistent, strong, and carefully attuned for mother figure.*
  - *Never angry, present and just being with her, deeply patient and seeing how special she is for father figure.*
- Kept protective and playful adjectives for both ideal parent figures.

**Key Concepts**

- DBT treatment was not effective due to patient's preoccupied attachment patterns and therapist's interventions.
- Attachment-focused therapy was introduced to address underlying issues and stressors.
- Therapist used adjectives given by the patient to describe her parents and applied positive opposites to ideal parent figures.

**IPF Protocol Session**:

**Patient's Anxiety**: The patient expresses anxiety about the upcoming test results and fears failure. She is hesitant to start the IPF (Ideal Parent Figure) protocol due to past discomfort.

**Therapist's Approach**: The therapist offers a temporal structure for the session, focusing on the patient's anxiety as a starting point. They aim to help the patient cultivate comfort and shift her habitual response to anxiety.

* **Comfort and Security**: The therapist explains that the goal is to develop an internal working map of comfort and security, which the patient has blocked off due to fear of disappointment and positive feelings.
* **Metacognitive Perspective-taking**: The therapist encourages the patient to consider her belief about the connection between comfort and negative outcomes as a symptom of anxiety, not a reality.
* **Collaborative Stance**: The therapist shows attunement to the patient and emphasizes the collaborative nature of their work together.

**Patient's Resistance**: The patient expresses concerns that focusing on comfort will make her feel worse and is hesitant to change the topic, fearing it would be difficult.

* **Leap of Faith**: The therapist encourages the patient to take a leap of faith and open up to the possibility of positive feelings.
* **Validation and Clarification**: The therapist validates the patient's anxiety about the test and clarifies their collaborative stance and treatment goal.

**Relaxation Techniques**: The therapist guides the patient through relaxation techniques, helping her develop interoception (immediate, direct sense of body sensations) and linking body sensation to emotions.

* **IPF Imagery**: The therapist introduces IPF imagery tailored to the patient from her Attachment Anxiety Interview (AAI), focusing on qualities that are positive opposites of adjectives the patient used to describe her actual parents.
* **Patience and Acceptance**: The therapist emphasizes the importance of patience, understanding, and acceptance from the ideal parents in the imagery.

**Observations**: The therapist observes the patient's progress throughout the session, adjusting the qualities of the ideal parents as needed to ensure a comfortable fit for the patient.

**Helen, discussing her anxiety and recalling memories of parents who exhibited different levels of confidence and attunement.**
* Therapist encourages Helen to focus on the image of parents who have confidence in her self-development and are deeply attuned to her needs.
* Helen imagines these parents as being there when she needs them but also allowing her independence.
* Therapist guides Helen to use her imagination to fully experience this feeling, noticing her body sensations and emotions.
* Helen struggles to focus on her internal state and instead recalls a nurse from the hospital who provided comfort and understanding.
* Therapist acknowledges the importance of this attachment figure in Helen's life and encourages her to weave this quality into her imagined parents.
* Helen reflects that this nurse made her feel important, and the therapist affirms this feeling.

**Helen expresses difficulty imagining understanding parents and feeling special to them.**
* The therapist acknowledges Helen's uniqueness and attunement from her parents.
* Helen feels something is wrong with her, but can't understand why.
* Therapist encourages Helen to recognize her internal emotional state and patterns.
* Helen identifies tension in her arms and hands, anxiety level at 8 out of 10.
* Therapist redirects Helen back to the IPF exercise, focusing on body sensations.
* Helen notices her ideal parents' acceptance and comforting presence.
* Therapist fosters metacognitive awareness, asking about feelings towards her parents' stance.
* Helen experiences a feeling of sadness as she connects with her attachment-based longing for her parents.
* Therapist recognizes the shift in Helen's stance and encourages her to adjust the imagery for comfort.
* Helen expresses a desire for physical closeness, such as having her head in her parents' laps or having them play with her hair.
* The therapist acknowledges Helen's agency in seeking proximity and understanding her needs.
* Helen experiences a decrease in anxiety to a level 3 out of 10.
* Therapist asks if it is okay to leave the scene, and Helen nods in agreement.

**In the following session, Helen shares a dream**
* she perceived the therapist as upset and crying about her reaction to Helen's words. The therapist acknowledges this perception but clarifies that her emotions were not related to Helen's sharing.
* Patient (Helen) had a dream where she noticed her therapist reacting to what she was saying during an interview, but she wasn't sure what the reaction was or its significance.
* The therapist suggested exploring themes from the dream that could be relevant to Helen's therapy.
* Helen mentioned that it was strange her therapist seemed to have reactions to her answers but didn't want her to notice.
* This reminded Helen of her experiences with her mother, who had variable responsiveness and confusing emotions.

**Exploring the Dream**

* The therapist encouraged Helen to open up to what the dream might be pointing to in terms of her feelings and experiences during their interviews.
* Helen recalled instances where her therapist smiled during the interview, which she initially thought was because she couldn't answer a question but later realized it was a sign of collaboration and holding space for her.
* The therapist asked Helen about other emotions or ideas she noticed during the interview that might have contributed to an intimate moment between them.
* Helen remembered feeling more open and less scared, as well as experiencing moments where she surprised herself with her thoughts and feelings.

**Impact of the Dream**

* The therapist pointed out how the dream symbolized Helen's growing ability to approach difficult emotions and thoughts that were once scary.
* In a later session, Helen reported feeling better overall and having traveled with a friend over the weekend.
* Despite her improvement, Helen still experienced challenges in engaging with important figures (IPFs) due to her past experiences of uncertainty and fear.

**Mood State and Distraction**

* During this session, Helen expressed concern about her mood state and the possibility of entering a prolonged period of negative emotions.
* She mentioned that she had difficulty focusing on tasks and was afraid of experiencing extended bad periods.
* The therapist acknowledged Helen's progress but encouraged her to make a distinction between times when she could force herself to work hard and times when she needed to tend to herself and pay attention to her moods.
* Helen shared that she was able to recognize the upset as part of acclimating and adjusting, which allowed her to take time for self-care before returning to her work.

**Metacognitive Mastery**: The therapist acknowledges the patient's improvement in recognizing her emotions and states of mind, marking it as a significant progress from the beginning of therapy. The patient feels uncomfortable with the therapist's enthusiasm and expresses resistance towards DBT.

**Guided Imagery**: The therapist leads the patient through a guided imagery exercise, asking her to imagine being with her ideal parents in various scenarios. The patient struggles to stay focused and shifts her thoughts to past experiences.

**Flexible Approach**: The therapist flexibly goes along with the patient's shift and asks her to redo the scene with her ideal parents instead of the actual ones from her past.

**Ideal Parent Figures**: The therapist guides the patient through imagining her ideal mother and father being present during a crisis, focusing on their sturdiness, warmth, patience, and responsiveness. The patient describes feeling calmer and reassured in their presence.

**Metacognitive Identification**: The therapist encourages the patient to notice her internal feelings and track when shifts occur to foster metacognitive identification of her state.

**Outcome**: The session ends with the patient expressing a sense of safety and increased focus, feeling calmer and more reassured in the presence of her ideal parents.

**Therapist's Instructions**:
- Absorb feelings from previous discussion
- Imagine a scene with ideal parents for comfort and security
- Share observations of the effect of their presence

**Patient's Experience**:
- *Yesterday, felt agitated and alone while lying on bed*

**Addressing Self-Consciousness**:
- *Patient sits between ideal parents, both present and calming*
- *Notes their qualities: accepting, non-judgmental, calming, and present*
- *Effect: able to get up and not feel stuck*
- *Relaxation achieved by resting head on their shoulders*
- *Deep relief and relaxation in body and mind*

**Conclusion**:
- Patient felt good after the session
- No desire for further scenes at that time.


**Three Pillars Treatment: Helen's Case**

* **Introduction**:
  * Helen's AAI transcript showed an increase in coherence from a 2 to an 8.
  * Her attachment status changed from disorganized (CC/E3/Ds1) to earned secure status with some anxious-preoccupied features (F5).

**Manifestations of Insecure Strategies and Psychotherapy Interactions**

* Anxious-preoccupied features may reappear at the outer ranges of the secure (F) spectrum.
* These manifestations are more likely during relationally intimate experiences, such as psychotherapy interactions.
* Helen continued to show some anxious-preoccupied features but significantly less so than during early treatment period.
* Despite her comorbid bipolar spectrum disorder and vulnerability to high stress levels and disrupted sleep, she was able to recognize and regulate these states using metacognitive mastery.

**Impact of Internal Working Model on DBT Skills Use**

* Before earned secure attachment status, Helen resisted using DBT skills due to past feelings of rejection and neglect.
* Developed internal working model of unconditional acceptance and dedicated attunement made her more likely to use skills.

**Importance of Interoception in BPD Treatment**

* Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) often lack the ability for interoception, or feeling their emotions in their bodies.
* Instead, they focus on reading others' feelings, consistent with anxious-preoccupied attachment style.
* New psychotherapies for BPD should aim to increase interoceptive ability.
* Three Pillars model integrates interoceptive development into therapy process.

**Treatment Considerations for Disorganized Attachment with Anxious-Preoccupied and Dismissing Strategies**

* In the next chapter, focus on treatment considerations for patients with disorganized attachment who show a prominent mix of both anxious-preoccupied and dismissing strategies.

## Chapter 13 Treating Disorganized or Fearful Attachment

**Origins of Disorganized or Fearful Attachment**

Main and Solomon (1986) identified a group of infants with disorganized attachment based on their contradictory behaviors in the Strange Situation (SS) procedure. This group showed a collapse of behavioral strategies for attachment, resulting in multiple, contradictory internal working models.

* Disorganized attachment reflects a lack of a single, unified IWM for attachment.
* **Grossmann, Grossmann, and Waters (2005) differentiated the disorganized category into three subtypes**:
	+ Contradictory attachment behaviors
	+ Attachment behaviors lacking any goal orientation
	+ Direct disorganization

**Origins of Disorganized Attachment**

* Prolonged or repeated separations from caregivers (Chisholm, 1998; Solomon and George, 1999)
* Mothers with depression and alcoholism (Solomon and George, 1999)
* Frightening and frightened behavior by the primary attachment figure (Main and Hesse, 1990)
	+ Mothers who are both a source of security and fear for the infant
	+ Resulting in "fear without solution" (Lyons-Ruth & Jacobvitz, 1999)
* Dissociated behavior by parents (Schuengel, Bakermans-Kranenburg, and van IJzendoorn, 1999)
	+ Unresolved past trauma, abuse, or loss in mothers (George and Solomon, 1996)
	+ Corresponding pervasive fear in the infant
* High likelihood of child maltreatment (Lyons-Ruth & Jacobvitz, 1999)
	+ Extreme parental misattunement and disrupted affective communication
	+ Hostile, aggressive, helpless, or confused behavior by caregivers
	+ Pervasive pattern of disruptive or inaccurate affective communications between infant and caregiver
	+ Role reversals and getting the child overly involved in parent's state of mind

**Characteristics of Children with Disorganized Attachment**

* Multiple, contradictory attachment behaviors – both deactivating and hyperactivating
* More dissociative experiences and behaviors than other children
* Chronic negative affect states with poor capacity for affect regulation
* Inhibited exploratory behavior
* Marked impairment in self-development

**Conclusion**

The origins of disorganized attachment are complex, and there seem to be multiple pathways to its development. Disorganized attachment sometimes occurs in seemingly normal families, but it always emerges within a particular relationship with one parent or caregiver. Children with disorganized attachment show significant negative emotional arousal and impairment in self-development.

### The Therapeutic Stance With the Disorganized Patient

**The Therapeutic Stance with Disorganized Patients**

* Important for therapist to be a safe haven and not exacerbate fear
* Calming, soothing, reassuring presence
* Actively engaging but not involving in therapist's state of mind
* Comforting, fearless, confident, accepting, welcoming, determined, proactive
* Fully present, consistent, steady, predictable
* Consistently attuned to and nonverbally matching of patient's affects
* Encourage and reinforce positive emotional expressions
* Careful not to interrupt patient's attachment displays

**Characteristics of Caregivers of Disorganized Patients**

* Served as both source of fear and safety
* High negative emotional arousal and unremitting fear arousal
* Frightening, frightened, and/or hostile and helpless
* Dissociative and shift behaviors and states suddenly and markedly
* Misattuned to infant and unable to engage in reciprocal attunement

**Working with Ideal Parent Figures (IPF) Imagery with Disorganized Patients**

* Majority of disorganized subjects have personality and/or dissociative disorders
* Rapid and marked shifting of states of mind and behaviors
* Each shifting behavior and state of mind is a spontaneous expression of attachment need
* Facilitate patient's experience of separate and unique set of IPFs for each shifting behavior or state of mind
* Suggest new set of ideal parent figures for each significant behavioral or state shift in the treatment session
* Patient's overall experience approximates continuous IPF responsiveness

**Understanding Dissociation and Structural Dissociation in Therapy**

- ***Van der Hart et al.* **(2004) argued against the distinction between two types of dissociation**: dissociative shifts in consciousness and structural dissociation.
- Instead, they proposed that there is one type of dissociation, namely **structural dissociation**, which pertains to rigid compartmentalization of dissociative parts.

**Treatment Approach for Structural Dissociation**

- In the 1980s, a common practice was to call forth and send back alter personalities (alters), but this reinforces the rigid dissociative compartmentalization.
- Van der Hart et al. recommended that once communication with an alter is finished, ask it to stay present instead of going back inside.
- Then, communicate with another alter while the first one remains present. This technique erodes the rigid dissociative compartmentalization and promotes a unitary, noncompartmentalized self.

**Adapting Structuralizing Technique for Disorganized Patients**

- After working with IPF imagery with one alter state, invite other parts to come forward while the current part remains present.
- When a patient has a spontaneous structural dissociative shift, ask the just-spoken-with part to remain present with ideal parents (IPFs) while the new part engages with them.

**Themes for IPF Imagery with Disorganized Patients**

- **Attachment Strategies**: All specific IPF considerations and practices discussed in previous chapters apply to disorganized patients due to their deactivating and hyperactivating attachment strategies.
- **Security and Threat**: IPFs provide a deep sense of security while being carefully attuned and responsive to the patient's fear and mistrust.
- **Attachment Behavior and Exploratory Behavior**: IPFs encourage both attachment behavior and exploratory behavior in the same interactive sequence.
- **Chronic-heightened Fear Arousal**: IPFs are carefully attuned to the child's fear arousal and know how to comfort and reassure them.
- **Protection**: IPFs are fiercely protective but not intrusively protective of the patient-as-child.
- **Emotional Arousal**: IPFs stimulate the patient-as-child's full range of emotional arousal in the intersubjective collaboration.

**Role of IPFs**:

1. **Fully present and attuned to the patient-as-child**:
   - Consistently and accurately attuned in moments
   - Reassuring and calming presence
2. **Consistently responsive to communications**:
   - Accurately responds to patient's initiatives
   - Helps patient feel seen, supported, and safe
3. **Effectively contain during states of rage or hostile aggression**:
   - Calms the child and makes them feel safe
   - Honors patient's feelings and helps express safely
4. **Steady, optimal levels of arousal and consistency**:
   - Provides relief for disorganized patients
   - Helps correct poor self-regulation and control
5. **Provide just enough structure to maintain clarity and organization of mind**:
   - Supports patient's coherence and reduces confusion

**Five Primary Behavioral Conditions for Secure Attachment**:

**Protective IPFs**:
- Approachable safe haven
- Associated with calmness and serenity

**Attuned IPFs**:
- Consistently and accurately recognize and respond to full range of negative and positive emotional states
- Diminish emotional numbness and support intersubjective reciprocal exchange

**Supporting the Disorganized Patient**:

By focusing on these considerations, clinicians can effectively address the needs of disorganized patients:

1. **Parental presence**: IPFs provide a fully present and attuned presence to help disorganized patients feel seen, supported, and safe.
2. **Consistency and reliability**: IPFs offer consistent responses and steady levels of arousal to help correct poor self-regulation and control in disorganized patients.
3. **Interest**: IPFs show genuine interest in the patient's experiences and emotions, fostering a sense of connection and security.
4. **Protection**: IPFs provide an approachable safe haven that is not associated with fear arousal but rather with calmness and serenity.
5. **Attunement**: IPFs consistently and accurately recognize and respond to the full range of the patient's negative and positive emotional states, supporting intersubjective reciprocal exchange and reducing emotional numbness.

- Disorganized patients have difficulty with trusting their affects and expressing them effectively in relationships due to unresolved attachment issues from childhood.
- The IPF approach helps disorganized patients by providing a safe, consistent relationship that supports the reactivation and balance of the attachment behavioral system.
- IPFs respond effectively to disorganized attachment behaviors, enabling patients to express healthy, organized attachment behaviors when proximity-seeking is needed.

**IPFs' Role in Supporting Disorganized Patients**

- IPFs are attuned to the patient's attachment behaviors and respond contingently to support reactivation and balance of the attachment system.
- They effectively soothe patients with high fear arousal, helping them feel safe and secure.
- IPFs encourage self-development by providing a supportive environment for exploration and growth.

**Individualizing IPF Protocols Based on AAI Responses**

- The Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) is used to identify the five adjectives that reflect a patient's early childhood relationship with each parent.
- Patients may experience each family-of-origin parent as both a source of attachment need and support and a source of fear and threat, resulting in disorganized attachment patterns being associated with both parents.
- Therapists ask patients to describe specific memories or incidents that illustrate the chosen adjectives for each parent during the AAI session.

**Example of IPF Protocols Based on AAI Responses**

- **A DID patient with a history of episodic dyscontrol and violent, aggressive behavior gave the following responses to the five adjectives for her mother**: caring, nurturing, torturous, angry, and moody.
- The therapist asked the patient about specific memories or incidents that illustrate each adjective during the session.
- Similarly, the patient described her father as affectionate, scary, overbearing, powerful, and loving.
- The therapist asked the patient about specific memories or incidents that illustrate each adjective for her father during the session.

**Ideal Parent Figures in Imagery Process (IPF)**

- Therapist translates negative adjectives for each parent into positive opposites
- **Ideal mother figure**: deeply caring, nurturing, calm, soft-spoken, steady
- **Ideal father figure**: physically affectionate, serene, gentle, empowering, protective
- Patient describes parent figures embodying positive characteristics
- Therapist draws attention to the effect on patient's inner state and organization of mind

**Fostering Collaboration with Disorganized Patients**

- Clear, collaborative treatment frame agreement necessary due to higher risk of treatment-frame violations
- Nonverbal communication differences between secure and disorganized mothers and infants from early on
- Therapist recognizes, acknowledges, and addresses negative-affective displays
- Collaboratively helps patient bring metacognitive awareness to nonverbal behaviors
- Difficulty understanding verbal communication, therapist points it out and works collaboratively for clarity

**Enhancing Metacognitive Skills in Disorganized Patients**

- Low reflective capacity or mentalizing skill
- Importance of increasing patient's range of metacognitive skills
- Disorganized patients show low coherence of mind and frequent state shifts
- Consistent use of disorganization/organization anchor scale to identify and master states
- **Developing specific metacognitive skills**: recognizing current orientation, taking a wider perspective.

### Stages in the Treatment of the Disorganized Patient

1. **Establishing a Mutually Agreed Upon Treatment Frame**:
   - Collaborative negotiation of clear expectations, responsibilities, and ground rules
   - Addressing disruptions caused by noncollaborative behavior of disorganized patients
2. **Attenuating Fearfulness**:
   - Early focus on reducing fearfulness in general or fearfulness related to certain parts of the mind
   - Ideal Parent Figures (IPFs) provide protection and safety without fear
   - IPF work done consistently until patient can sustain a sense of safety
3. **Addressing Dismissing Parts or Behaviors**:
   - Shaping IPFs for each part or self-state that has deactivated the attachment system
   - Normalizing longing for attachment and addressing shame
   - Soothing and containing acting-out impulses
4. **Working with Resistant Parts or Self-States**:
   - Cooperative behavioral system used when strong resistance is encountered
   - Introducing IPF imagery for parts that are not yet connected or blocking connection
   - Shaping IPFs to address and help these parts
5. **Calling Forth All Parts**:
   - Systematically calling forth parts that need to feel securely attached
   - Decreasing dissociation and fostering a unified sense of self
6. **Activating the Exploratory Behavioral System**:
   - IPF imagery for parent figures who encourage and support self-development
   - Secure base for exploration within a unified self
   - Supporting self-development through methods in Appendix A
7. **Cultivating Postformal Metacognitive Skills**:
   - Developing coherence of mind and orientation focused on present, adult, self
   - Relinquishing hyperactivating strategies and attachment behaviors
8. **Developing Secure Adult Intimacy**:
   - Turning to the theme of developing secure adult intimacy (see Appendix B)

### Case Illustration

**Case Illustration**: A patient with a complex trauma profile including PTSD, major depression, and self-cutting behavior underwent various treatments throughout her late 20s and 40s. She had been sexually abused by her father during her childhood and adolescence, leading to dissociative identity disorder (DID) later in life.

**Background**: The patient's mother was overly concerned with her appearance, and her father was a minister with a history of alcoholism. She participated in an incest survivor’s group for seven years followed by two years of individual phase-oriented trauma treatment to process childhood sexual abuse memories and emotions. During this treatment, she became increasingly dissociated and developed alter personality states.

**Treatment**: The therapy was changed to attachment-based methods when she received a diagnosis of DID. In the first phase of treatment, the therapist introduced Internal Parent Figures (IPFs) who could provide safety and protection without fear to each part. The patient reported a Wise Man as an initial IPF, who helped her focus and stay present. She also requested IPFs that could stay with her during dissociative episodes.

**Progress**: Initially, the therapy was successful in helping the patient stop self-cutting and achieve stabilization. However, she began to experience more frequent dissociation and reported an increase in angry voices and scared child parts. The therapist asked her to imagine IPFs who could be most responsive to their fears. She chose Whoopi Goldberg as an IPF for the vulnerable child parts and the Dalai Lama for those that didn't know about secure attachment relationships.

**Session Transcript**: During a therapy session, the patient switched between paranoid alters and vulnerable child parts. She expressed feeling alone, scared, and unsure of why she was feeling worse despite recent improvements. The therapist acknowledged her fears and encouraged her to imagine IPFs that could provide security without fear. However, the patient resisted this idea.

**Challenges**: The patient showed dismissing attachment behaviors and couldn't imagine growing up in a family where she felt secure. She felt terrible and continued to feel deeply alone and vulnerable. The therapist emphasized the importance of imagining IPFs that could provide security and help her overcome her feelings of aloneness.

**Outcome**: Despite her initial resistance, the patient eventually began to imagine IPFs who could provide the sense of security she had never felt before. The therapy continued to focus on attachment-based methods to help her process her traumatic experiences and develop a stronger sense of self.

**Patient expresses dismissive attitude towards attachment and feelings of vulnerability and fear.**
* Therapist emphasizes the naturalness and healthiness of feeling vulnerable and needing connection.
* Patient acknowledges her fear of connection due to past experiences of rejection and harm.
* Therapist encourages patient to imagine ideal parents (IPF) who would provide a secure attachment free from fear and judgment.
* Patient begins to imagine IPF as Whoopi Goldberg, someone who encourages free expression and acceptance.
* Therapist reinforces the idea of IPF's unconditional love and acceptance, which transforms the patient's feelings.
* Patient achieves a sense of security in the imagined connection with IPF.
* Therapist extends the concept of secure attachment to other parts of the patient's psyche that are not yet feeling connected.
* Patient imagines bringing the connection to dismissing parts, represented by "devil parts" and the Wise Man.
* Therapist encourages active engagement with dismissing parts, emphasizing understanding and compassion for their fear and isolation.

**The patient is afraid due to past attachment figures being associated with fear and exploitation**
* introduces a new figure, the Wise Man, who is different and offers security and compassion.
* The therapist positively reframes the patient's fear as longing for attachment and helps them explore their feelings.
* The patient begins to see proximity-seeking as something positive and starts exhibiting exploratory behavior.
* The therapist encourages metacognitive awareness of the patient's state of mind and fosters curiosity about their real nature.
* The patient starts to remember their capacity for innocence and wonder, which was forgotten due to limiting beliefs.
* The therapist reframes attachment as a normal part of the child's real nature instead of a source of shame.

**The patient expresses a desire to find the place of no pain with the Wise Man but struggles with limiting beliefs.**
* The therapist assures the patient that the security of the connection runs deeper than their limiting beliefs and encourages them to imagine just the right kind of secure relationship for all parts of their mind.
* During subsequent sessions, the patient forms Internal Parent Figures (IPFs) for various parts of their mind, including Whoopi, Atticus, the Dalai Lama, a Guardian Angel, a Wild Animal Trainer, and Gandhi.
* The patient begins to develop metacognitive capacity to monitor and modify beliefs about their father's ongoing negative influence.
* They form a new IPF, the Count of Monte Cristo, to replace the abusive father figure.
* The patient reports feeling good after forming this new attachment figure and later forms another IPF, a policewoman, to address suicidal thoughts and protect child parts from their father's abuse.

**The patient is experiencing suicidal thoughts and feels disconnected from life.**
* Doris and the therapist encourage the patient to find value in living and offer support.
* The patient begins to form an attachment with the therapist through attachment-based treatment.
* The patient's inner parts, including fearful and resistant ones, start to see the therapist as a secure base.

**Exploring the Cave**:

* The patient leads the therapist into her favorite place, the cave, where she feels safe.
* The Wise Man engages the resistant parts and invites them to join in the exploration.
* The patient gains insight into her childhood dilemma of seeking comfort from her parents but experiencing terror instead.

**Forming a Secure Relationship**:

* The therapist helps the patient understand that she doesn't have to relive past traumas and can remember them without fear.
* The Wise Man tells stories to reassure the child parts and creates a sense of security in the relationship.
* The patient begins to see the whole self as a greater whole, with all parts feeling securely connected.

**Integrating Dismissing Parts**:

* The therapist introduces an orchestra analogy to illustrate how all parts are part of a greater whole.
* The patient starts to integrate dismissing parts into an emerging wholeness of self.
* The devil parts, initially resistant, begin to feel secure in the relationship and let go of their need to be in control.

**Overcoming Fear**:

* The patient's fear shifts from fear of being harmed to fear of losing the attachment.
* The therapist acknowledges the patient's fears but encourages her to trust the secure relationship.
* The patient struggles with the idea of all parts feeling securely connected simultaneously, but eventually begins to understand that it is possible.

**Patient's Fear and Desire for Security**

* Therapist appreciates this protective behavior but encourages feeling secure in the relationship
* The Wise Man, Mother X, Atticus, Whoopi, and other parent figures understand and accept the patient's parts for who they are

**Exploration and Curiosity**

* When the patient feels cared about and secure, they can explore with curiosity and control
* They imagine exploring caves filled with different rooms and discovering new things without fear
* The caring response from Atticus allows the parts to feel reassured and secure, enabling them to venture out and explore more

**Fostering Metacognitive Awareness**

* The patient becomes aware of their thoughts and feelings as they relate to attachment and security
* They notice how their state of mind changes when all parts feel secure in the relationship
* The therapist encourages the patient to directly sense the effect of feeling secure on their mind

**Structuralizing and Wholeness**

* The patient imagines a flame with many reflections, representing the diverse parts within them
* They realize that despite the seemingly different parts, there is a constant flame of self that is always present
* The therapist encourages the patient to look beyond the changing parts and focus on the wholeness of self

**Collaborative Approach**

* The therapist takes a collaborative approach, engaging with the patient in their exploration of attachment and security
* They discuss the patient's experiences and help them make sense of their feelings

**Postformal Metacognitive Skills**

* The therapist introduces the concept of looking at things from a wider perspective to gain a deeper understanding
* The patient begins to see the wholeness of self amidst the changing parts

**Emerging Wholeness and Diversity**

* The patient explores the theme of wholeness and diversity using metaphors like a jewel with many facets and a waterfall with individual drops that make up the whole
* They begin to experience a stable, unified sense of self as the noise of the parts recedes

**Significant Changes**

* The patient reports a marked diminished activity of the "noise" of the parts
* They experience fewer night awakenings from terrifying nightmares and instead wake up feeling safe
* They become more reflective and less reactive, feeling valued and real
* They show compassion for their abusive father through the lens of the Wise Man
* They feel comfortable exploring the world with the support of the Wise Man

**Metacognition and Organizational Capacity**

- The patient is beginning to show signs of metacognitive capacity, relating different states to each other (e.g., more organized mind when parts are secure)
- **Growing awareness of organization of mind (example**: "I notice that when things are stressful, I get more organized...")

**Fear of Change and Discovering New Coping Mechanisms**

- Therapist invites direct experience and exploration of self as a continuous narrative over time

**Metacognitive Perspective: Awareness as the Jewel**

- Patient discovers new metacognitive perspective through the analogy of a crystal (awareness) given by Brother Z
- Operating from this new perspective leads to unification of alter personality states into a wider whole

**Metacognitive Perspective: The Sun and the Crystal**

- Therapist invites patient to adopt a wider metacognitive perspective by looking at themselves as the sun, observing the reflections (parts) from that vantage point.
- Patient realizes that parts are reflections of their being and not independent entities.

**Sun, Planets, and Parts**:

- The patient sees the sun as a central core or complete part of herself, larger than other parts or "planets."
- From this vantage point, she experiences certainty and order.
- The patient is unsure if the planets (parts) are expressions of the sun or separate entities.

**Metacognition**:

- The therapist encourages the patient to foster a wider metacognitive perspective.
- The patient reports that at times, her thoughts follow each other in an orderly way and she experiences quiet inside.
- She also mentions improved concentration and focus, as well as being more spontaneous and genuine in her responses.
- The patient acknowledges the limits of her knowledge but also recognizes some ordering internally.

**Change and Growth**:

- The patient has noticed changes in herself, such as less scattering and fewer different personas.
- She has developed greater awareness and the ability to choose how to act in situations.
- The patient no longer feels like she is all parts with no whole but rather a quiet whole.

**Metacognitive Skills**:

- The patient has learned to be more aware of her thoughts, feelings, and actions.
- She can now hold multiple perspectives at once and make choices based on reflection.
- The patient has developed a healthy sense of exploration of her own mind.

**Mentalization-Based Therapy: Fourth Year of Treatment**

**Patient's Self-Articulation of Newly Emergent Self**

- By the end of the fourth year, patient was able to identify various qualities of her new self.
  - Clearer understanding of negative states of mind.
  - Recognition of relativity of these states.
  - **Focus on positive qualities**: present, clear, full, curious, loving, gratitude, affection, belonging, worthiness, completion, anticipation of growth, enjoyment, a little tentative.

**Session Transcript**

**Internalized Mentalization Stance**
- Patient developed an internal representation of felt attachment to therapist.
- This led to increased stability and openness to the therapist's seeing and knowing her mind.

**Metacognition of Relativity of States**
- Therapist helped patient understand that loneliness is a construction of the mind, not an inherently negative state.
- Patient realized that her ideas about loneliness were what weighed her down, rather than the state itself.

**Impact of Context on Awareness and Organization**
- Patient noticed that things happening in her life affected her awareness and organization, which in turn influenced her feeling state and peace of mind.

**Vulnerability to External Things**
- The patient's anticipation of losing her dog made her more vulnerable to external stimuli.
- She was unsure if this was due to dissociation or a change in organization.

**Metacognitive Awareness of Contextual Effects**
- Therapist acknowledged the impact of context on the patient's state of mind.
- Patient recognized that her awareness and feeling better were being lost, possibly due to a dissociative shift.

**Dissociation**
- The patient was experiencing less disorganized dissociation but more nonawareness dissociation.
- She was still less present and aware under stressful conditions, such as the potential loss of her dog.

**Improvement**
- Despite the ongoing challenges, the patient saw this as an improvement due to her increased understanding of mentalization and metacognition.

**Patient expresses paradoxical experience of being less aware but more aware of being less aware after a year of internal change**
* Therapist acknowledges partial loss of awareness, not complete
* Patient connects current situation to difficulty dealing with hopeless situations and feeling helpful in those moments
* Patient derives satisfaction from being helpful and feels good about herself in these instances
* Feels less present and helpful when not in an aware state and facing her own loss
* Therapist explores connection between patient's experience and dealing with family members' deaths at work
* By the end of fourth year, patient no longer met diagnostic criteria for PTSD or DID
* Patient's coherence of mind improved from 1.5 to 8.5 on AAI and reflective capacity from –1 to 8.5 on Reflective Functioning Scale

**Three Pillars of Treatment Model: Overview**

- Chapters 8, 9, and 10 describe the three pillars of the treatment model (Relational Understanding, Repairing Early Experiences, and Building New Attachments)
- Chapters 11, 12, and 13 discuss applying the model to each primary insecure attachment type
- Consistent treatment structure for all patients

**Component 1: Determining the Nature of the Disturbance**

- Identify if the presenting problem is primarily an attachment issue, CCRT (Core Conflictual Relationship Theme), or trauma-bonding
- Assess coexistence and interference of CCRT or trauma-bonding with attachment insecurity
- **Secure attachment with some degree of anxiety or dismissing features**: assess interference with relationships before focusing on CCRT or trauma-bonding

**Component 2: Assessing the Attachment Problem**

- Obtain Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) transcript and scoring for determination of attachment types and subtypes, coherence of discourse, and reflective functioning
- Use Metacognition Assessment Scale (MAS) to identify condition-specific pre-treatment deficits in metacognition
- Experience of Close Relationships (ECR) questionnaire for quick assessment of attachment style

**Component 3: Collaborative Dialogue and Treatment Planning**

- Establish shared treatment goals and a specific treatment plan using transparency model
- Explain the Three Pillars approach and its rationale and methods
- Provide psychoeducation on attachment, its origins, and forms (secure and insecure) using sample scripts
- Introduce Ideal Parent Figure component for creating new internal working models of attachment when discussing specific insecure attachment subtypes with patients.

### Psychoeducation About Attachment

**Attachment**

- Essential connection with important people, particularly parents or primary caregivers during childhood
- Every child has an innate drive for healthy attachment
- **Secure attachment**: feeling protected, safe, soothed, supported, encouraged exploration, and independence
- **Insecure attachment**:
  - **Anxious attachment**: clingy, worried about unavailability, limited learning and development
  - **Avoidant attachment**: emotionally and physically distant, excessive exploration, limited contact or comfort seeking
  - **Disorganized attachment**: combination of anxious and avoidant behaviors

**Internal Working Models (Maps) of Attachment**

- Formed during early childhood, mostly during the second year of life
- Affect experiences of self and others throughout life
- Repeated patterns in relationships without awareness
- Can be modified for healthier attachment

**Dismissing Attachment**

- Parents did not fully meet attachment needs
- Experienced parents as rejecting or dismissive of attachment needs
- Developed internal working model of caregivers as rejecting or dismissing
- **Effects**: dismissal of own attachment needs, self-reliance, challenging relationships, sense of connection being problematic or unnecessary
- **Goal**: develop new, positive internal working model for healthy, secure attachment

**Characteristics of Caregivers with Dismissing Attachment**

- Uncomfortable with physical contact and emotional expression
- Less emotionally attuned or expressive than caregivers of secure children
- Selectively attuned to negative emotions and behaviors, misattuned to positive ones
- Strong, rigid ideas about parenting, making child feel unseen, controlled, and rejected for unique self

**Therapy Goals for Dismissing Attachment**

- Develop new, positive internal working model of relationships
- Create "ideal parent figures" who actively engage, have consistent attunement, understanding, emotional and physical availability, responsiveness, acceptance, encouragement, and flexibility
- Experience positive connection without fear or shame
- Maintain independence while feeling close and connected in relationships

### Psychoeducation About Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment

**Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment**

- Result of unmet attachment needs in early childhood
- **Parents were likely**: inconsistently responsive, unresponsive, poorly timed, overly anxious
- Formed an internal working model or attachment map

**Factors Leading to Anxious-Preoccupied Internal Attachment Maps**

- Consistently unresponsive or inconsistent responses
- Poor timing of responses
- More attuned to negative experiences and feelings than positive ones
- Overly anxious parents, causing children to become hypervigilant

**Effects of Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment**

- Expectation to be overattuned to others, not attuned enough to self
- Preoccupation with other's state of mind at the expense of own
- **Outside-in orientation**: focusing on others' experiences and needs
- **Difficulty managing emotions**: high levels of anxiety or anger
- **Interference with self-development**: difficulty developing a strong sense of self

**Goals for Overcoming Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment**

- Develop a new, positive internal working model of relationships
- **Inside-out orientation**: awareness of own feelings and wants/needs
- Balanced and truly mutual relationships
- Becoming best self as unique person

**Creating Ideal Parent Figures**

- Deeply interested in individual
- Attuned to individual's needs
- Capable of providing right responsiveness in various situations
- Calm individuals when anxious
- Encourage curiosity and exploration while being supportive
- Help create new possibilities, allowing for self-expression and growth.

### Psychoeducation About Disorganized Attachment

**Disorganized Attachment**

- Category identified in Adult Attachment Interview
- Result of unmet attachment needs during early childhood
- **Causes**:
  - Prolonged separations
  - Parents as frightening, confusing, or disconnected
  - Caregivers described as aggressive, disruptive, loud, or fearful
  - Parents felt overwhelmed with responsibilities and unable to respond consistently
  - Unresolved loss or trauma affecting parenting abilities

**Effects of Disorganized Attachment on Child Development**:

- Experiencing parents as both source of security and threat
- Needing to reach out for safety while fearing harm
- Increased fear arousal and mistrust around people
- Unsuccessfully seeking safety and comfort in attachment relationships
- **Conflicting attachment behaviors**: disconnecting or maintaining intense contact
- Lack of balanced, sustained, safe, and enhancing connections with others

**Characteristics of People with Disorganized Attachment**:

- Bossy, compulsively caretaking, or fearful interpersonally
- Shifting internal experiences and lack of coherence
- **Dissociative experiences**:
  - Feeling "out of it"
  - Rapidly shifting between different aspects or parts of self
  - Rapidly shifting between mood states (frightened, angry, helpless)
  - Temporarily losing connection to where one is
  - Periods of time that can't be remembered or accounted for.

**Therapeutic Process**:

1. **Creating Ideal Parent Figures**:
   - Develop "ideal parent figures" through imagination.
   - Ensure parents are a safe haven, free of fear.
   - Encourage exploration and self-discovery.
2. **Collaborative Communication**:
   - Address noncollaborative nonverbal behavior.
   - Promote collaborative nonverbal behavior.
   - Address noncollaborative verbal behavior.
   - Promote collaborative verbal behavior.
3. **Treatment Frame**:
   - Discuss potential problems and create a contract.
   - Collaborate on addressing noncollaborative behavior.
4. **Imagery Process**:
   - Clarify difference between memory and imagination.
   - Use imagination to create ideal parent figures.
   - Establish inner conditions for imagery (calm, relaxed focus).
   - Address resistances and difficulties.
5. **Qualities of Ideal Parent Figures**:
   - **Protection**: Provide safety and security.
   - **Attunement**: Recognize and respond to emotional needs.
   - **Soothing**: Reduce fears and anxieties.
   - **Expressed delight**: Show appreciation and enjoyment.
   - **Support for best self-development**: Encourage growth and exploration.
6. **Individualizing Ideal Parent Figures**:
   - Based on attachment prototype, emphasize specific qualities.
   - **For dismissive patients**: deep acceptance, accurate attunement, normalization of feelings, openness, fostering exploration in the context of attachment.
   - **For anxious-preoccupied patients**: consistent attention to state of mind, provision of comfort and security, repeated support for exploratory behavior, fostering best self-development.
   - **For disorganized patients**: reliable provision of soothing and comfort, reduction of fears related to attachment.

**IPF Imagery in Interactions with Patients**:

* Shape imagery to include calm, comforting, and predictable behavior
* Safe haven and full presence
* Careful attunement to patient's fear or mistrust of attachment
* Consistent soothing of acute or chronic fear arousal
* Consistent contingent responsiveness
* Fierce protectiveness from harm or abuse
* Setting appropriate limits during aggressive arousal episodes
* Encouragement of both attachment and exploratory behavior

**Metacognitive Skills Development**:

1. **Basic and Intermediate Skills**:
   * Use methods to support metacognitive skills based on patient's attachment prototype
   * Enhance identification of state of mind for dismissing patients
   * Foster mentalizing stance for preoccupied patients
   * Enhance mentalizing and reflective capacity for disorganized patients
   * Apply anchoring scales, affective marking, and modeling to promote mentalizing
2. **Later Intermediate and Advanced Skills**:
   * Gradually introduce advanced skills for each attachment type
   * Fostering awareness of contextual effects, wider perspective on life purpose, and interconnectedness for dismissing patients
   * Promoting metacognitive awareness of state organization and orientation for preoccupied patients
   * Helping disorganized patients adopt a wider perspective on self and foster metacognitive awareness of past/present, self/other, and child/adult
3. **Later Phase of Treatment**:
   * Introduce and shift to development of later advanced metacognitive skills
   * Appreciation of interconnectedness and interdependence, discovering central guiding purpose or ultimate concerns of life, sensitivity to knowledge acquisition through nonrepresentational awareness for all attachment types
4. **Progress and Success**:
   * Notice, point out, and discuss signs of treatment progress and success with the patient
5. **Self-Development and Secure Intimacy**:
   * Toward end of treatment, include methods to promote self-development and secure intimacy
   * Consolidate gains from therapy and further promote healthy exploratory behavior in all aspects of patient's life

**Additional Resources**:

* Reflective Function Questionnaire (RFQ) - a self-report measure of mentalizing being developed by Peter Fonagy and his colleagues.

## Chapter 15 Treatment Outcomes
**Indicators of Successful Treatment**

Over the past 20 years, the Three Pillars treatment has identified several markers of successful outcome:

1. **Achievement of earned secure attachment**:
   - Change from pre-treatment insecure attachment (Ds1, Ds2, Ds3, E1, E2, E3, CC) to secure attachment (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5), as measured by the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI).
   - First described by Levy et al. (2006) as a measurable outcome of therapy.
2. **Formation of a new, positive stable internal working model for healthy adult attachment**:
   - Development of a new representation for secure attachment through ideal parent figure imagery and therapeutic relationship.
   - Self-reported experiences of IPF imagery, including secure base and balance between attachment and exploratory behaviors.
   - Healthy relationships with therapist and others outside therapy.
3. **Capacity for adult secure intimacy**:
   - Development of a new positive representation for adult secure intimacy.
   - Patient makes partner choices and engages in intimate behaviors that match the new positive map of secure intimacy.
   - Use of self-report measures like the Experience in Close Relationships (ECR) questionnaire.
4. **Manifestation of a range of metacognitive skills**:
   - Increase in metacognitive skills during treatment, as measured by the Reflective Functioning Scale (RF-S) and Metacognitive Assessment Scale (MAS).
   - Achievement of postformal cognitive development.
5. **Manifestation of healthy behavioral, nonverbal, and verbal collaboration**:
   - Adherence to treatment-frame behaviors outlined in the treatment contract.
   - Increases in nonverbal collaborative behavior, such as head-turning, eye contact, and matched facial affect displays.
   - Increase in verbal collaborative behavior, assessed through AAI transcripts based on adherence to Grice's maxims for coherent discourse.
6. **Achievement of high coherence of transcript and coherence of mind on the AAI**:
   - Increase in coherence of transcript and coherence of mind as assessed with the AAI, reaching a minimum level of 7 or above by the close of treatment.
7. **Resolution of unresolved status (Ud) with respect to trauma and loss**:
   - For patients with unresolved status (Ud) at the beginning of treatment, an expected outcome is the achievement of resolved status by the end of treatment.
   - Ud score below the cutting score of 5.5 on the AAI.
8. **No longer meeting diagnostic criteria for a personality disorder, dissociative disorder, or any trauma-related diagnosis in the DSM-5 or ICD-10**:
   - Many patients with significant attachment disturbances have a personality disorder, dissociative disorder, or severe chronic PTSD.
   - By the end of Three Pillars attachment-based treatment, many of these patients no longer meet diagnostic criteria for any of these disorders.

### A Case Illustration of Successful Treatment and Its Measurement

A 46-year-old woman with a history of severe childhood abuse underwent Three Pillars attachment-based treatment, which resulted in the resolution of her dissociative identity disorder (DID) symptoms.

**Background**:

* Seeking consultation for nine-year treatment by a therapist using phase-oriented trauma treatment
* Five years into therapy, began reporting memories of severe childhood physical and sexual abuse
* Trauma processing became central focus, leading to expanding domain of increasingly horrific memories
* Previous therapist noted lack of mention of mother in five years of treatment

**Assessment**:

* Initial assessment using the Attachment Interview (AAI), Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D), and other inventories
* **Primary attachment classification**: cannot classify (CC) with unresolved (Ud) status for childhood physical and sexual abuse and loss of father as an adult
* Met full diagnostic criteria for DID on the SCID-D
* Pre-treatment DIS-Q scores were in the range predictive of DDNOS but lower than expected for full DID
* **Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI) showed significant elevation in five clinical scales**: Anxious Arousal, Intrusive Experiences, Defensive Avoidance, Dissociation, and Low Self-Esteem
* Extremely low memory suggestibility on the Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale
* Lowest possible value (1.0) on overall coherence of transcript score from initial AAI
* High idealization but lack of evidence for early relationship with mother on AAI

**Treatment**:

* No trauma processing during the two and a half years of treatment
* Emphasis on resolving disorganized attachment according to Three Pillars treatment model

**Outcome**:

* Post-treatment assessment using AAI, SCID-D, DIS-Q, and TSI
* Improved overall coherence of transcript score (7.0) on post-treatment AAI
* Able to give all five adjectives for the early childhood relationship with her mother and provide clear memories as illustrations
* Continued tendency toward idealization but not clinically significant
* Post-treatment SCID-D showed no evidence of alter personality states, loss of executive control, or dissociative amnesia
* Post-treatment DIS-Q scores showed a drop in all dissociative features
* Figure 15.1 shows the change in self-reported dissociative symptoms (post-treatment scores are slightly above normal range but below clinically significant levels)

**Trauma Symptoms**:
- **Pre-treatment Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI)**: All five clinical scales above the cutting score fell below it in post-treatment TSI response.
- Three validity scales were within normal range for both pre- and post-treatment TSI responses.

**Depression**:
- Pre-treatment Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-1) score was 21, indicating moderate-to-severe depression.
- Post-treatment BDI-1 score was 7, placing the patient within asymptomatic range.

**Key Findings**:
- Significant drop in dissociative, traumatic, and depressive symptoms and disorders from treatment.
- No trauma processing or focus on depression during treatment.
- Increased organization of mind may have a positive effect on trauma-related symptoms independent of trauma processing.

**Implications**:
- Traditional phase-oriented trauma treatment may be contraindicated for patients with complex trauma and disorganized attachment due to potential interference with treatment progress and resolution.
- Attachment-based treatment, designed to increase organization and overall coherence of mind, can resolve not only disorganized attachment but also dissociative, traumatic, and depressive symptoms.

### A Pilot Outcome Study

- The authors conducted a pilot study on their approach to attachment-based treatment using 12 patients.
- They collected and scored pre-and post-treatment Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) for all patients, with some pre-scores assessed by an independent scorer.
- High interscorer agreement was observed between the two scorers.

**Pre-Treatment Findings**:
* Eight of 12 patients (66.6%) received a primary attachment classification of "cannot classify" (CC).
* Four patients (33.3%) received a preoccupied (E) classification.
* Six patients (50%) had unresolved status with respect to trauma or loss.
* Average coherence of transcript on the AAI at the onset of treatment was 2.21, indicating very low coherence of mind.

**Post-Treatment Findings**:
* All 12 patients (100%) attained earned secure status on the AAI after an average treatment duration of 3.4 years.
* Significant increase in coherence of transcript and coherence of mind was observed.
* Those with unresolved status regarding trauma or loss became resolved.

**Statistical Analysis**:
- Paired-samples T-test showed a statistically significant difference in patients' coherence of transcript scores before and after treatment (p < 0.001, d = 6.23).
- Reflective functioning (RF) scores also significantly improved from 1.68 to 4.36 (p < 0.001, d = 2.34).

**Conclusion**:
- The Three Pillars treatment model is an effective attachment-based approach that integrates principles and practices for repairing attachment disturbances in adults.
- **The three pillars of the treatment target different dimensions of functioning**: the patient's relationship with the therapist, specific methods to address deficiencies, and the Ideal Parent Figure (IPF) method.
- The pilot study suggests that the Three Pillars treatment is effective, although it may not be a short-term intervention.
- The authors hope this pilot study will stimulate larger-scale outcomes research using their approach.
- Periodic treatment ruptures are inevitable due to the "real" aspects of the therapist, but can be addressed using the principles of the Three Pillars model
- Ruptures facilitate developmental and healing processes leading to earned security
- No focus on painful past experiences during treatment, except for initial evaluation
- Co-create an imagined childhood with positive experiences through IPF method
- Work in present with metacognitive and collaborative pillars
- Address pain from past experiences within the context of one or more pillars
- Trauma history is addressed when sufficient structure for affect regulation is built
- Development of Three Pillars model draws from essential components of maternal responsiveness

**Maternal Responsiveness and Three Pillars**

- **Ideal parent figures**: consistently attuned to patient's behavior, internal state, and developmental level
  * Soothing provided contingently and effectively
  * Expressed delight for patient's being and behaviors
  * Attuned support for exploration
- Development of metacognitive capacity fostered by therapist's attuned presence and responsiveness
  * Recognition and identification of inner states
  * Reflection of patient's immediate experience
- Collaborative, cooperative capacity enhanced through therapist's careful presence and responsiveness
  * Moment-to-moment nonverbal and verbal experience

**Effectiveness of Three Pillars Model**

- Patients experience rapid changes leading to relief, greater self-confidence, agency, and better relational experiences
- Clinical experience and small pilot study demonstrate effectiveness
- Looking forward to future outcome studies and refinements.

## Appendix A The Core Self, Proactive Self-Agency, Self-Esteem, and the “Best” Self - Normal and Incomplete Self-Development

**Self-Development and the Psychological Sense of Self**

The psychological sense of self does not develop in infants at birth but emerges around 18 months of age, marking the initial structuralization of the self. The self evolves as cognitive development matures, incorporating more complex relationships and extending over various contexts.

**Early Developmental Stages**:

- **Infancy (0-18 months)**: Basic structure of the self forms.
  * Capacity for self-observation begins to develop between six and eight months.
  * Representational thinking emerges around 12 months.
  * Psychological sense of self first appears around 18 months.

**Later Developmental Stages**:

- **Latency Age (7-11 years)**: Concrete operational thinking develops, leading to an internal sense of mind, rich emotional life, and concerns oriented toward peer involvement.
- **Adolescence**: Formal operational thinking emerges, enabling the self to handle more complex social relationships and perceive infinite possibilities.
- **Early Adulthood**: Content of the self turns toward intimacy and family.
- **Midlife**: Further cognitive maturation leads the self to develop wider civic and community concerns.
- **Later Adulthood**: Self develops a keener vision of ultimate concerns and a wider vision of life.

**Experiential Consequences of Completing Basic Self-Structure in Childhood**:

1. **Central organizing principle**: Having a psychological sense of self provides a central organizing principle for daily life, enabling individuals to define themselves from the inside out instead of trying to define themselves based on external factors.
2. **Subjective sense of coherence**: A strong sense of self offers a subjective sense of internal organization and mental clarity, allowing people to experience their thoughts as well-organized or disorganized.
3. **Sense of continuity across time, place, and state**: A psychological sense of self provides a sense of sameness throughout the various stages of life, despite changes in experiences and development.

**Weak or Arrested Self-Development**:

1. **False-self organization**: Someone with this form never develops a clear sense of their own self and defines themselves based on external cues. They present themselves accordingly to fit into different situations, reflecting the absence of an authentic, strong, unique, and independent self.
2. **Fragile self**: This person has some degree of experience of a personal self but keeps it deeply private and hidden from others due to fear of negative reactions or destruction of their private self.
3. **Incomplete self**: Someone with this form shows some degree of self-development but remains incomplete and fragile due to early learned chronic hypervigilance about the states and needs of others. They attend to and respond to the needs of others at the expense of themselves, appearing as chronic caretakers who lack self-distinction or self-assertiveness.

**Impact of Caregiver Involvement**:

An involving caregiver can interfere with normal self-development by consistently failing to provide comfort, soothing, and reassurance when the child is anxious, leading to weak or poorly formed self-structure in later childhood and adulthood. This can result in anxiety, worry, and little capacity to tolerate emotional intensity.

**Self-Development and the Core Experiential Sense of Self**

- Establishing a core experiential sense of self is the foundation for self-development.
- The core self is the basis for self-definition, which are consistent and stable aspects of the self.
- The core self can be evoked at any time in daily life, creating a "feeling of selfness."
- Object relations theory suggests this ability comes from evocative memory.

**Self-Agency**

- Emergence of self-agency supports the experience that the core self with definitional qualities is effective and has impact on the world and others.
- Individuals who lack a sense of self-agency have difficulty being effective in their actions and have little awareness of their impact on others.

**Self-Esteem**

- Self-esteem is the linking of positive affect with the self-representation.
- Healthy self-esteem is experienced against a backdrop of positive emotional states.
- Narcissistically vulnerable people have difficulty evoking the sense of self in association with positive emotional states and may experience it against no or negative emotions.

**Promoting Self-Development**

- Therapeutic interpretation of deficits in self-development is not effective as a treatment technique.
- Systematic introduction and repetition of positive imagery to cultivate each dimension of self (core self, self-definition, self-agency, self-esteem, best self) are recommended methods for fostering mature self-development.

**Methods for Promoting Self-Development**

1. Do not believe in therapeutic interpretation of deficits in self-development as an effective treatment technique.
2. Value systematic introduction and repetition of positive imagery to enhance the core self, self-definition, self-agency, self-esteem, and best self.

**Methods for Developing the Core Sense of Self**

The following is a step-by-step visualization protocol for developing self-definition and a core sense of self:

1. **Scene Generation for a Sense of Core Self**:
   - Therapist introduces suggestions to help patient define qualities of positive core self.
   - Patient generates a scene about being most themselves, free from expectations.
   - Instructions can be varied with more suggestive detail to prompt imagination.
2. **Defining and Enumerating Unique Qualities**:
   - Patient reflects on the scene and identifies unique qualities of core self.
   - Therapist supports conditions for discovery and exploration of core features of self.
   - Patient reports each quality, which is mirrored, emphasized, and amplified by therapist.
3. **Amplification of Self-Qualities**:
   - Therapist mirrors, emphasizes, and amplifies patient-reported qualities to strengthen experience.
   - Emphasis and amplification parallel to affect marking.
4. **Stabilization and Maintenance of Self-Qualities**:
   - Patient recognizes that self-qualities are always with them.
   - Therapist uses time distortion to enhance recognition and familiarity.
   - Qualities become stable and present in all situations.
5. **Transferring Self-Definitions to Other Contexts**:
   - Patient imagines embodying named qualities in new scenes and contexts.
   - Therapist mirrors and amplifies patient's reports of experiencing self-qualities in new situations.

**Scene Generation**

* Therapist introduces suggestions for defining core self scene.
* Patient generates a scene about being most themselves.
* Instructions can be varied with more suggestive detail to prompt imagination.

**Defining and Enumerating Unique Qualities**

* Patient reflects on the scene and identifies unique qualities of core self.
* Therapist supports conditions for discovery and exploration of core features of self.
* Patient reports each quality, which is mirrored, emphasized, and amplified by therapist.
* **Important working principle**: therapist frames and supports conditions for discovery and exploration of core features of self, free from expectations.

**Amplification of Self-Qualities**

* Therapist mirrors, emphasizes, and amplifies patient-reported qualities to strengthen experience.
* Emphasis and amplification parallel to affect marking.

**Stabilization and Maintenance of Self-Qualities**

* Patient recognizes that self-qualities are always with them.
* Therapist uses time distortion to enhance recognition and familiarity.
* Qualities become stable and present in all situations.

**Transferring Self-Definitions to Other Contexts**

* Patient imagines embodying named qualities in new scenes and contexts.
* Therapist mirrors and amplifies patient's reports of experiencing self-qualities in new situations.
* Several scene shifts to reinforce the experience of self-qualities in various contexts.

**Common Problems in Self-Definition Development in Patients with Severe Self-Deficits**

**Inability to Attend and Observe**:

* Patients with attention deficits require concentration training before self-definition development.
* **Poor self-observational ability**: introduce exercises for self-observation and metacognitive reflection.

**Difficulty with Imagination Task**:

* Patients may not recognize the core self in reported scenes.
* Suggest disidentifying from thought and focusing on immediate sensory experience.
* Core self may emerge as an overall sense or specific qualities.

**Focusing on Others' Expectations**:

* Patients with incomplete selves report scenes that include others' expectations.
* Encourage patients to find their deeper, authentic self beyond others' expectations.

**False Self-Expression**:

* Patients may express false qualities without affective component.
* Emphasize authenticity of self-qualities and encourage self-expression from a deeper self.

**Hidden, Private Self**:

* Patients who guard a hidden self may initially report no qualities.
* Suggest exploring the most precious or special self that is never shown to others.

**Negative Self-Talk**:

* After initial positive response, some patients engage in negative self-talk.
* Encourage awareness and letting go of negative thoughts without engaging them.
* Treat negative thoughts as an internal self-critical part and ignore them.

Overall, the text discusses various problems that may arise during self-definition development for patients with severe self-deficits. These issues include inability to attend and observe, difficulty with imagination tasks, focusing on others' expectations, false self-expression, and negative self-talk. Solutions include concentration training, self-observation exercises, disidentifying from thought, exploring deeper selves, and ignoring negative thoughts.

### Methods for Developing Proactive Self-Agency
**Self-Agency Development**

* Self-agency is the development of internal representations of being an active, effective agent in the world, including the interpersonal world.
* **Self-experiences accompanying self-agency development**: mastery, self-efficacy.
* **Self-experiences accompanying lack of self-agency development**: helplessness, ineffectiveness, hopelessness.

**Development of Self-Agency**

* First develops during the "practicing" period of early childhood.
* Emergence of representations of constructive self-agency as motor system and language develop.
* Children learn to anticipate and develop action plans toward goals.
* Healthiest sense of self-agency allows for an overall perspective, proactivity, good time organization, and a strong sense of self-efficacy and mastery.

**Indicators of Healthy Self-Agency**

* Adults with healthy self-agency are successful in work and life endeavors.
* Children and adults with well-developed self-agency are able to organize plans and goal-seeking behavior effectively.

**Indicators of Lack of Self-Agency**

* Feeling ineffective and helpless.
* Passive-dependent, letting others define goals and methods for achieving them.
* Impulsive behavior due to lack of internal action planning.
* Inability to predict consequences of actions over time.
* High internal conflict between competing goal-states.
* Chronic interpersonal difficulty in eliciting desired responses from others.

**Scene Generation for Proactive Self-Agency and Interpersonal Self-Agency**

* Therapist prompts for scenes focusing on proactive self-agency and later interpersonal self-agency.
* Patients imagine scenes where they feel especially effective or making an impact in their lives.
* Importance of cultivating a strong sense of interpersonal self-agency.
* Therapist introduces suggestions for imagining scenes where patients have a real impact on others and elicit desired responses from them.
* Application of the same principles and methods to patient's responses as in developing self-definition.

### DEVELOPMENT OF GOAL-SETTING AND ACTION PLANS
* Fostering healthy anticipation, action-planning, and goal-setting for patients with underdeveloped self-agency
* Process begins with goal identification
  * Patient identifies a clear, realistic goal
  * Therapist helps patient connect to core sense of self if necessary
* Development of the action-planning process
  * Patient develops a specific plan to achieve the goal
  * Organizes sequence of steps in the action plan
  * Rehearses the action plan in mind
  * Estimates time frame for achieving the goal
  * Daily evaluates progress toward the goal
* Internal rehearsal of the action plan as effective
* Exploring causes and effects of behavior (for patients with impulsivity)
  * Reflecting on past impulsive behaviors and their consequences
  * Fostering metacognitive awareness for predicting consequences over time
  * Rating likelihood of different outcomes
  * Altering behaviors to change the outcome in a desirable way
* Patients develop internal probabilistic representations of likely outcomes, refining self-agency and reducing impulsiveness.

### REDUCING CONTRADICTORY GOAL-STATES
* Emmons (1999) found that human goal-strivings are complex and can include contradictory goals.
* Healthiest individuals have least internal contradiction across goals and experience comfortable self-agency.
* Those with intense, competing contradictions become inhibited in areas of their lives due to uncomfortable affect associated with conflicting goal-states.
* **Two ways to reduce contradiction and resulting conflicting goal-states in therapy**:
  * Prioritizing goals based on importance or significance to core self and developing action plans toward those goals.
    * Diminishing less important competing goals leads to less internal contradiction.
  * Articulating a clear, central guiding purpose or ultimate concern in life.
    * Subsuming all goals under this ultimate concern reduces internal contradiction and discomfort.

**Being Proactive**

* Developing a proactive stance is a sign of maturity in self-agency.
* Patients can anticipate the likely course of implementing an action plan and respond proactively to keep it on track.
* To foster a proactive stance, patients can imagine being proactive in various situations and describe how they are doing so.

**Methods for Developing Healthy Self-Esteem**

* Sandler defined healthy self-esteem as the developmental linkage of positive emotional states to the self-representation.
* Consistent expressed delight from attachment figures is the most important factor in developing healthy self-esteem in childhood.
  * Parents openly expressing positive feelings toward their child leads to internalization and linkage to the developing sense of self.
* Repeated experience of mastery in childhood is the second source of healthy self-esteem.
  * Mastery leads to a sense of competence and confidence, but can be used as an overcompensation for lack of early positive mirroring.
* Establishment of structure and consistent limit-setting is the third source of healthy self-esteem in older children.
* Self-psychology was developed as an approach to psychotherapy for people with extreme, chronic self-esteem failure.
  * Therapist openly admits limitations and failures of empathy, but treatment is slow and may not necessarily overcome chronic self-esteem failure.
* Positive self-esteem protocol was created to directly and systematically evoke positive feeling states in conjunction with the self-representation.
  * Includes situation-based self-esteem enhancement, enhancement of self-esteem in relationships, skill development for quicker evocation of positive self-esteem, stress challenge, and integrating self-esteem as a way of being.

### SITUATION-BASED SELF-ESTEEM ENHANCEMENT

* People with impaired self-esteem can think of situations where they feel good about themselves
* Positive self-esteem experiences linked to activity and mastery in certain situations
* Protocol begins with scene generation
  * Therapist asks patient to imagine a situation where they're feeling especially good about themselves
  * Focus on affect amplification to help patient intensify positive feelings
* Extend duration of positive self-feelings
  * **Direct methods**: therapist suggests extending the duration or using time expansion suggestions
  * Generate series of scenes to extend duration
* Patient practices imagining situations that evoke positive self-feelings and focusing on them as homework

**Enhancing Self-Esteem in the Context of Relationships**

* More difficult for patients with self-esteem deficits to evoke positive feelings in relationships
* Therapist asks patient to imagine a situation where they're feeling especially good about themselves in relationship to others or being respected and appreciated by others
* Apply methods for affect amplification and extending duration of positive self-states

**Skill Development**

* Develop skill in generating positive self-feelings quickly and for longer durations
* **Foster rapid evocation of positive self-states**: see how quickly patient can access positive feelings about themselves
* **Extend duration of positive self-states**: notice that patient can hold positive feelings for longer periods
* Set goal to hold positive self-feelings for longer durations in and outside therapy sessions
* Help patient generalize positive self-feelings to other situations
* Use anchoring scale to promote metacognitive awareness of positive self-feelings and self-esteem
* Patient rates self-esteem using a scale of 1 to 10 and reviews progress with therapist
* Complete step when patient can sustain positive self-feelings throughout most of the day, nearly every day.

### STRESS CHALLENGE 
* Maintaining positive self-feelings in situations previously associated with negative self-feelings
* Therapist introduces expectation of maintaining strong, positive feelings about oneself in difficult situations
* Patient experiences having and holding positive feelings about self in challenging imagery
* Therapist uses methods to amplify positive states and extend their duration
* Patient is given assignment to test progress by putting themselves in challenging situations

**Integrating Self-Esteem as a Way of Being**
* Development of positive self-esteem transcends activities and becomes a way of being
* Therapist encourages imagining scenes of contentment within oneself, not relying on accomplishments
* Patient may imagine feeling good about themselves as part of their core being
* For those with a history of self-reproach, therapist suggests imagining lightness of being or not taking things seriously
* Therapeutic focus is on positive feelings of being, not doing

**Developing the Best Self**

* **Focus on cultivating patient's best self**: strongest, most autonomous, and unique sense of self
* Scene generation of moments experiencing best self
* Enhancing awareness of felt experience and qualities of best self
* Transferring "best-self state of mind" to other situations
* Best-self method originally a hypnotic method developed by Erika Fromm
* Used extensively in couples therapy and performance excellence courses for judges

**Fostering Uniqueness of Self and Vital Engagement**

* Parents should support child's discovery and strengthening of uniqueness, not expecting them to fit parental molds or meet agendas
* Therapist suggests imagining an attitude of curiosity and exploration of one's unique qualities
* To foster vital engagement, therapist encourages imagining scenes of actively engaging in life with vitality and enthusiasm.

### Self-Development From an Attachment Perspective 
- Self-development protocol emphasizes the development of the self as separate from attachment development
- Core-self experience and definition, self-agency, and self-esteem can be developed through imagery focused on the self independently

- For patients with personality and dissociative disorders, focus on both self-development and positive attachment representations systematically

**Self-Development in the Context of Attachment Relationships**

- **For patients with little or weak self-development**:
  - Apply principles described in this appendix in the context of all principles and practices of introducing and working with patients’ ideal parent figure imagery
  - Ideal parent figures encourage and support the development of a strong, autonomous, and unique sense of self
  - Collaboratively engage with the patient to become metacognitively aware of consequences

**Supporting the Development of Self-Agency**

- **For patients with poorly developed self-agency**:
  - Ideal parent figures reinforce contingency responsiveness
  - Consistently respond to response-eliciting behaviors
  - Encourage interpersonal self-agency
  - Collaboratively support and encourage the development of organized goal-directed behaviors and action plans
  - Engage with the patient to become metacognitively aware of consequences

  - Parental support for feeling competence and mastery in various endeavors

**Resources for Clinicians**

- Encouraged to review Chapters 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13 of the book for more information on IPF imagery process.

## Appendix B Protocols for Developing Adult Secure Intimacy in Individuals and Caring Behaviors in Couples

**Secure Intimacy and Attachment**

- Secure attachment leads to healthy exploratory behavior (Bowlby)
- **Adult romantic relationships can be attachment relationships if they manifest**: safety/protection, attunement, soothing, expressed delight, and fostering self-development
- Secure attachment relationships promote secure intimacy, allowing exploration and growth for each partner

**Promoting Secure Intimacy in Psychotherapy**

- Once a patient achieves secure attachment status, therapy can focus on developing secure intimacy
- **Patient develops a vision of secure romantic attachment with the following five dimensions**:
  - General vision of secure intimate relationship
  - Each dimension promoting secure attachment (safety/protection, attunement, soothing, expressed delight, fostering self-development)
  - Individualized positive descriptors of ideal parent figures

**Shaping the General Vision of Adult Romantic Secure Intimacy**

- Hypnotherapy method of future-time orientation used to help patients construct a vision of secure intimacy
- Patient describes a scene representing their personal vision of secure intimacy
- Therapist mirrors and enhances elements, encourages further elaboration
- Patient imagines day-to-day life of manifesting the best of a secure intimate relationship
- Therapist supports and encourages further exploration and fixes the vision in mind as a guide for future relationships.

### ARTICULATING THE FIVE PRIMARY CONDITIONS THAT PROMOTE SECURE INTIMACY

**Secure Intimacy: Five Primary Conditions**

The therapist suggests the patient bring to mind their personal vision of secure intimacy and become familiar with it. The therapist then guides the patient through imagining scenes that illustrate each of the five primary conditions that promote secure intimacy:

1. **Feeling Safe and Protected**:
   - **Scene**: Partner providing a sense of safety and protection in the relationship
   - **Description**: Specific ways partner enables feeling safe and protected
   - **Effect**: Affects state of mind and experience in the relationship
2. **Careful Attunement**:
   - **Scene**: Partner carefully attuned to patient's ways of being, growing, needs, feelings, and internal state of mind
   - **Description**: Scene and what's happening when partner is so attentive
   - **Effect**: Affects state of mind
3. **Comfort and Reassurance**:
   - **Scene**: Partner providing comfort and reassurance during emotional upset
   - **Description**: Specific ways partner enables feeling completely comforted and reassured
   - **Effect**: Affects state of mind in the relationship
4. **Delight and Appreciation**:
   - **Scene**: Partner expressing delight and appreciation for patient's being
   - **Description**: Specific ways partner shows delight and appreciation
   - **Effect**: Affects state of mind in the relationship
5. **Encouragement and Support**:
   - **Scene**: Partner encouraging and supporting patient to bring out their best, strongest, unique self
   - **Description**: Specific ways partner enables patient to bring out their best self
   - **Effect**: Affects state of mind and future growth in the relationship

The patient is asked to describe each scene and what they notice about the effects on their state of mind. The therapist emphasizes taking the time to fully absorb these experiences.

### INDIVIDUALIZING THE SECURE INTIMACY PROTOCOL

The goal is to individualize the secure intimacy protocol for each patient based on their early caregiver relationships and specific attachment needs.

1. **Use information from Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)**
   - Five adjectives used to describe each caregiver are particularly useful.
   - Translate negative adjectives into positive opposites.
   - Use these positive descriptors in developing adult secure intimacy imagery.
2. **Integrate other relevant information**
   - Address specific attachment needs and past experiences.
   - **Examples**:
      * **Discomfort with physical closeness**: develop images promoting comfort.
      * **Difficulty relying on others or asking for help**: include suggestions for dependency.
      * **Mutuality**: imagine a partner who cares as much as you do.
      * **Difficulty opening up emotionally**: imagine a partner with whom you can express emotions freely.
      * **Conditional love and acceptance**: imagine a relationship where you can be yourself and are loved unconditionally.

**Process**:

1. Develop a new, positive internal working model for earned security of attachment using ideal parent figures.
2. Once earned security is established, use the positive descriptors from the development of patient's secure attachment to ideal parent figures in developing adult secure intimacy imagery.
3. Integrate any available information about each particular patient to individualize the protocol further.

### Caring Behaviors in Couples

* Patients in romantic relationships may be confused by the individual secure intimacy protocol as it suggests a future ideal relationship instead of focusing on the current one.
* Therapists prefer to work with both partners to foster secure intimacy through caring behaviors.

**Erosion of Romance and Caring Behaviors in Relationships**

* Couples may settle into routines, leading to a decrease in romance and caring behaviors.
* Regardless of relationship length or sense of security, the restoration or development of healthy adult romantic secure intimacy is important for optimal satisfaction.

**Imago Relationship Therapy (IRT)**

* Developed by Harville Hendrix in 1988 to help couples develop a deeper connection and understand each other's needs.
* Based on attachment theory, object relations theory, developmental psychology, behavioral change techniques, and neuroscience.

**Exercise for Developing Caring Behaviors in Couples (IRT Process)**

1. **Current caring behaviors**:
   * **In a session with both partners**:
      * Each partner shares things their current partner does that make them feel cared about or loved using stem sentences.
      * Partners listen and mirror what was heard.
2. **Early relationship caring behaviors**:
   * Each member of the couple visualizes early stages of their relationship and lists caring, romantic, loving things their partner did for them.
   * Partners share and mirror what they learned.
3. **Ideal future caring behaviors**:
   * Each partner imagines their ideal future partner acting in all the caring ways they've always wanted but couldn't ask for.
   * Using stem sentences, partners list loving or caring things they have always wanted but couldn't ask for.
   * Partners share and mirror what they learned.

**Benefits of the Three-Part Exercise**

* Collaborative exploration and exchange foster the restoration and/or development of caring behaviors.
* Couples experience secure intimacy with each other.
