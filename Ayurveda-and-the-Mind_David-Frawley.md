### Levels of Ayurvedic Healing

1. Ayurveda recognizes four levels of healing: 
   - **Disease Treatment** - may require invasive methods like drugs or surgery.
   - **Disease Prevention** - Eliminate factors in daily life that make us vulnerable
   - **Life Enhancement** -  Improve vitality, live longer
   - **Awareness Development** - Spiritual approach including meditation, ultimate goal is true awareness.
2. True awareness: Recognition of unity, transcends personal limitations, understanding of the Self as All, ultimate goal of Ayurveda.
3. Human problems arise from lack of true awareness, not just a lack of information but failure to understand our place in the universe.
4. The universe rests within us, all human beings are part of our own Self, all creatures are different forms of who we are.

## 2. Ayurvedic Constitutional Types: The Biological Humors of Vata, Pitta

Three Major Constitutional Types: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha.

## 3. The Three Gunas: How to Balance Your Consciousness. 

1. Three primal qualities (gunas) of Nature: Sattva, Rajas, Tamas.
2. **Sattva**: Intelligence, virtue, goodness; creates harmony, balance, stability. Light, luminous, inward and upward motion. Brings about soul's awakening.
5. **Rajas**: Change, activity, turbulence; introduces disequilibrium, motivates action, self-seeking, fragmentation, disintegration. Outward motion, stimulating but leads to pain and suffering. Force of passion causing distress and conflict.
6. **Tamas**: Dullness, darkness, inertia; heavy, veiling or obstructing in its action. Downward motion, causes decay and disintegration. Brings about ignorance and delusion, promotes insensitivity, sleep, loss of awareness. Principle of materiality or unconsciousness causing consciousness to become veiled.

The three gunas are one of the prime themes of Ayurvedic thought. 
- They form a deeper level than the three biological humors and help us understand our mental and spiritual nature and how it functions.
- All objects in the universe consist of various combinations of the three gunas.
- Cosmic evolution consists of their mutual interaction and transformation.

### CORRESPONDENCES OF THE THREE GUNAS 

1. Sattva:
   - Domain of consciousness, associated with clarity, truth, light, concentration, devotion.
   - Balance of Rajas and Tamas, combining energy and stability.
   - Increasing Sattva leads to peace, harmony, and liberation.
   - Pure Sattva transcends time and space, unites soul with God.
   - Imbalance can lead to cosmic evolution through disease and suffering.

2. Rajas:
   - Causes agitation, delusion, desire, distortion, turbulence, emotional upset.
   - Predominates in sensory aspect of mind due to constant seeking of enjoyment.
   - Leads to instability, loss of inner peace.

3. Tamas:
   - Ignorance that veils true nature, weakens perception.
   - Results in ego identification, isolation, and darkness.
   - Prevails in consciousness identified with physical body.

**Mental Types according to the Gunas**:
- Sattvic people possess harmonious nature, strive for balance, and have peace of mind.
- Rajasic people have good energy but burn out through excessive activity and seek power over others.
- Tamasic types have deep-seated psychological blockages and do not take responsibility for their lives.

**Mental Constitution according to the Three Gunas**:
- Sattvic nature shows a spiritual disposition with few psychological issues.
- Rajasic people have various psychological problems but can usually deal with them.
- Tamasic person has a danger of severe psychological problems.
   
### The Three Gunas and Therapy

- Sattvic: Love, peace, nonviolence; herbs, vegetarian diet, mantra, meditation.
- Rajasic: Stimulation, energization, agitation; breaks up Tamas, but not always beneficial.
- Tamasic: Sedation, sleep, grounding; sedates high Rajas, rarely useful in healing process.

#### Ayurvedic Healing Process:
- Sattvic healing is primary and uses natural methods.
- Rajasic and Tamasic modalities used under special circumstances.

#### Three Stages of Mental Healing:
1. **Personal Healing**: Breaking up Tamas/developing Rajas (moving from mental inertia to self-motivated action).
   - Fire is necessary for this transition.
   - Deep-seated patterns must be released, and new energies brought in.
   - Action indicated, not only in the mind but involving outer aspects of life.
2. **Healing of Humanity**: Calming Rajas/developing Sattva (moving from self-motivated action to selfless service).
   - Space is necessary for this transition.
   - Surrender personal pain and seek the greater good.
   - Depersonalize problems and take up humanity's problems.
3. **Universal Peace**: Perfecting Sattva (moving from selfless service to meditation).
   - Develop love and awareness as universal forces.
   - Inner peace becomes dominant force.
   - Transcend human condition to higher spiritual nature.
      
## 4. The Nature of the Mind

1. *Body vs. Mind*: Unlike the physical body, which has a clear structure and function, the mind is perceived as an amorphous entity.
2. *Mind as a Vehicle*: The mind is our primary tool for all actions, yet few understand how to use it effectively or care for it properly.
3. *Consequences of Ignorance*: Problems in life stem from not knowing the mind and its functions; they are secondary issues derived from this primary ignorance.
7. *Mind's Properties*: The mind has qualities that can be used for both good and bad, causing happiness or wreaking havoc.
8. *Solution to Psychological Problems*: Learning to use the mind properly is the key to solving psychological problems and realizing one's higher potential.
9. *Spiritual Life*: Understanding the mind leads to spiritual growth and transcending its limitations, ultimately reaching Pure Awareness.

### Mind as an Object. 
1. Mind as an Object:
   - We have always had a mind but never observed it.
   - To observe the mind, take the role of the observer and witness its functions.
   - Observe thoughts, feelings, impressions, and states of waking, dreaming, and deep sleep.
   - Maintain awareness in the attitude of witnessing the mind to learn what it is.
   - The mind is an object that exists apart from our awareness, which is its perceiver.
   - The mind is material and part of the external world, belonging to us but not who we are.

2. Mind as an Instrument:
   - The mind is an instrument or tool for deriving information from the external world.
   - It is a means of knowing devised by Cosmic Intelligence.
   - The mind is the ultimate machine, the best computer, and the highest organization of matter possible.
   - We are not conscious of the brain itself but only our actual thought process.
   - The mind is more subtle than the physical apparatus of the brain."

### Awareness and the Mind.

1. *Awareness*: Constant, unbroken sense of self or being; ongoing ability to observe and witness mental fluctuations. Not located in time and space, unaffected by actions.
2. *Mind*: Instrument through which awareness operates; has form, function, and movement; organically related to the physical body.
3. *Mind-Body Unity*: Organic unity but not the same; mind can function apart from body consciousness.
4. *Location of the Mind*: No specific location in the body; moves with awareness; not limited to the body as it can observe it.
5. *Awareness vs. Mind*: Awareness is pure consciousness, unchanging; mind is conditioned within the mental field, constantly changing.
6. *Mind's Functions and Physical Fluctuations*: Mind's functions change with physical fluctuations.
7. *Body as an Organ of Perception and Expression*: Primary organ for perception and expression.
8. *Mind and Body are not the Same*: Mind can function apart from body consciousness; mind is object of perception for the mind.
9. *True Awareness Transcends Both Mind and Body*.

### Atomic Nature of the Mind. 
1. *Atomic Nature*: The mind is atomic or point-like, consisting of shifting points of thought, feeling, and sensation. It has no fixed shape or size, pervading the body and field of perception.
2. *Limitations*: The mind can only focus on one object at a time, leading to a tendency to construct reality from limited perspectives. This process is inherently limiting as it presents only one side of reality.
3. *Mobile Nature*: The mind is constantly changing and in motion, impossible to still. It functions through rapid series of mental actions.
4. *Subtle and Sensitive Nature*: The mind is subtle, unpredictable, and sensitive, affecting and pervading all its contents. It must be treated with care due to its sensitivity.
5. *Dualistic Nature*: The mind is dualistic, consisting of opposite forces, prone to dualistic reactions, and moving between opposites. Thought always reinforces its opposite.

### Difficulty in Controlling the Mind.

1. *Mind is hard to control due to its volatile, subtle, dualistic nature.*
2. *Human life is a struggle to learn mind control.*
3. *If we master mind control, we've accomplished the universe's most difficult task.*
4. *Inability to control mind causes sorrow and disease process.*
5. *Mind equals thought; thoughts shape mind.*
6. *Thought forms are material and affect us.*
7. *Positive thought forms elevate, negative ones depress.*
8. *Deepest thoughts determine our change.*
9. *Change deep-seated habits through prayer, meditation, and concentrated thought.*
10. *Examine mind's nature: attention shifts, emotions fluctuate, thoughts follow each other compulsively.*
11. *Ego or "I-thought" is the root of all thoughts.*
12. *Learn to observe mind instead of being its victim.*
13. *Gaining mind control allows us to be true selves and create in harmony with our hearts.*.

## 5. The Five Elements and the Mind

1. Ether Element: Mind's primary composition, expansive, holds innumerable forms.
2. Air Element: Mind's movement, faster than light, coordinates body and senses.
3. Fire Element: Mind's illumination, capacity to understand.
4. Water Element: Mind's emotional quality, empathy, feeling.
5. Earth Element: Mind's weight, memory, attachment.

### Three Layers of the Mind: Causal, subtle, gross (physical) levels.

1. **Inner Mind** or Deeper Consciousness - Air: underlying mental sensitivity, deeper feeling nature, background vibratory field of energies, capacity for change, response, and transformation.
2. **Intermediate Mind** or Intelligence - Fire: rational or discriminating faculty, allows us to perceive and judge things, mediates between inner core consciousness and outer sensory functions.
3. **Outer Mind**, Sensation-Emotion Water: emotional nature, capacity to gather sensory impressions and respond to them, formative aspect of mind, basis of will, motivation, and action in the external world.
   
### The Two Levels of the Self

1. **Outer Self (Ego, Earth):** Defines self according to body; provides objective referent or identity; connects us to physical body; seeks acquisition or achievement; consciousness objectified.
2. **Inner Self (Soul, Ether):** Sense of pure subjectivity; transcends bodily identity; unites us with other creatures; finds peace in self-worth; content in its own identity; becomes Universal Self for liberation and immortality.

**Five Levels of the Mind:** 
- *Ether - Higher Self*: Underlying mind-space for all mental functions; provides background capacity for mental activities.
- Air - Inner Consciousness (Soul) Transcends bodily identity; finds peace in self-worth; unites us with other creatures.
- Fire - Intelligence
- Water - Sense Mind
- Earth - Ego. (Outer Self) Connects us to physical body; seeks acquisition or achievement; consciousness objectified.

### Workings of the Levels of the Mind.
1. *Outer Mind*: Doorway for external impressions from senses.
2. *Intelligence (Intermediate Mind)*: Determines which impressions enter based on dualistic emotions.
3. *Consciousness (Inner Mind)*: Interior room where deposited memories and tendencies form.
4. Impressions only enter when we react emotionally.
5. Sensory perception alone does not allow external energies in.
6. Detached observation digests impressions, preventing limitation.
7. Intelligence controls outer mind based on reasoning principles.
8. Perceptual Process:
   a. Outer Mind: Gathers impressions based on attention.
   b. Intelligence: Evaluates impressions and comes to conclusions.
   c. Inner Mind: Deposits impressions as memories and causes feelings.
   d. Ego surfaces after recognition, subjectively reacts to impressions.
   
### Action.

1. Action:
   - Allows us to act through the outer mind.
   - Transmits ideas to motor organs.
   - Determines intentionality (what we want to do).
   - Identified with actions through ego ("I am doing this").
   - Feels effects of actions inside ourselves through inner mind.

2. Levels of Awareness:
   - Ego (outer self): identifies consciousness with external objects, dependent upon them for identity and happiness.
   - Sense mind: responsible for thoughts, emotions, and planning.
   - Inner Self: underlying mindspace or inner self, seldom developed without self-observation through meditation.

3. Functions of the Mind:
   - Intelligence: determines what is true, good, valuable, or deep in meaning.
   - Emotion: movement of sensate mind, emotional reactions to things triggered by sensory impulses.
   - Consciousness/Heart: home of deep-seated states and enduring feelings.

4. Psychological Problems and the Energetics of the Mind:
   - Imbalance of mental energies produces disease or unrest.
   - Consciousness and inner Self are subtle and must be purified.
   - Healing the mind involves understanding consciousness and its functions.

5. The Five Bodies:
   - Physical Body.

   - Probes deeply into who we are and main issues of existence.
   
## 6. Conditioned Consciousness: The Greater Mental Field.

1. *Conditioned Consciousness*: A deeper level of awareness than ordinary thoughts, but not pure or unconditioned. Bound within space and time.
2. *Unconditioned Consciousness*: Timeless and infinite, beyond all movements of the mind; our true Self.
3. Spiritual growth involves shifting from conditioned to unconditioned consciousness.
4. Conditioned consciousness is the storehouse of memories and attachments, leading to psychological problems.

11. Chitta refers to the inner core of the mind, our center of pure feeling and direct knowing.
12. Most of Chitta is unconscious to the ordinary mind; only spiritually developed individuals can fully be aware of it.
13. Modern psychology's "unconscious" is a corner of this greater consciousness or Chitta.
14. Our potential field of consciousness extends to all consciousness in the universe, including God.
15. Yogic psychology focuses on the higher Self and the field of pure consciousness, which is the Absolute truth.

### Chitta, the Body of Consciousness.

2. Chitta is the substance of consciousness, constituting its body or bulk.
3. Mind and senses are limbs or organs of consciousness.
4. Physical body is made of heavy elements (water, earth), created by gravity.
5. Consciousness is composed of lighter elements (ether, air), a creation of thoughts.
5. Deeper consciousness maintains its processes below the outer mind.
6. Meditation awakens us to deeper consciousness' higher potentials.

2. **Collective Consciousness**: Access to human memories and tendencies, linking us to Cosmic Consciousness.
3. **Cosmic Consciousness**: Contact with the Divine Creator, holds all knowledge, transcends conditioned consciousness.
4. **Unconditioned Consciousness (Chit)**: Beyond conditioned consciousness, source of true genius and insight.
5. **Heart and Soul**: Chitta dwells in the heart, spiritual heart contacted on right side, seat of deep feeling and profound knowing.

*Intuition vs Imagination/Psychic Perception*: Intuition is direct feeling of consciousness, more vivid than sensory knowledge; imagination and psychic perception are functions of the outer mind and subtle senses.

## 7. Intelligence: The Power of Perception.
1. **Intelligence**: A central focus in Ayurveda and psychology, it's the power that illuminates life with truth. Misused, it leads to errors; used properly, it enhances self-awareness and respect for the world.

6. **True Intelligence**: Reveals the nature of things beyond appearances; perceives the eternal as real and transient forms as unreal; frees us from external belief structures.

### Each of us possesses an inherent ethical sense
1. Conscience is an inherent ethical sense, causing us not to wish harm and feeling others' pain as our own. It's a part of intelligence.
2. The more intelligent we are, the stronger our conscience and less desire to interfere or impose will.

### Psychological Disorders and the Biological Humors

*Psychological disorders* reflect imbalances of the three biological humors: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha.

Health problems are not personal failings but energetic issues in the mind-body complex.

1. **Vata (Air) Type**: Excess Vata causes instability, agitation, excessive thinking, fear, anxiety, insomnia, tremors, palpitations, and possible nervous breakdown. Factors that disturb Vata include hard-to-handle sensations, mass media, loud music, drugs, stimulants, irregular eating, low energy, stress, fear, violence, trauma, neglect, or abuse as a child.
2. **Pitta (Fire) Type**: Moderate psychological disturbances with strong self-control but potential for self-centeredness and antisocial behavior. High Pitta causes agitation, irritation, anger, possible violence, paranoid delusions, delusions of grandeur, or psychosis. Factors that increase heat disturb Pitta.
3. **Kapha (Water) Type**: Least psychological problems but can suffer from mental dullness, congestion, poor perception, attachment, lack of motivation, depression, sorrow, and clinging. Stronger Kapha types may experience greed and possessiveness. Factors that contribute to Kapha emotional disturbances include excess pleasure, enjoyment, or attachment in life, too much sleep, lack of exercise, Kapha-aggravating diet, emotional problems combined with physical conditions, or overindulgence as a child.

### Ayurvedic Counseling Profiles.

1. **Vata**: Nervous, anxious, worried, hesitant, hard to pin down, negative attitude, hypochondriacs, need calm minds and hearts, seek attention and sympathy, require patience and time, fluctuating condition, aim for slow steady development, sensitive hearts, easily frightened, prone to withdraw.

Ayurvedic counseling profiles are general and should not be taken rigidly.

Vata types have many doubts about themselves and treatments, expect immediate results, and may quickly quit or get frustrated.

Pitta types blame others or themselves for problems, are prone to conflict, and question therapists' qualifications.

Kapha types need stimulation, have difficulty implementing changes, and respond better to consistent prescriptions.

### Vata-Pitta.

1. *Vata-Pitta Type*: Combines volatility of air and fire. Fear and anger unpredictable. Difficult to trust, defensive, suspicious. Requires tact, patience, nurturing, supportive environment. Highly intelligent but volatile. Benefit from maternal force.

   - *Treatment*: Adaptability in treatment, comprehensiveness of approach. Deal with Vata problems first due to their likelihood to cause issues.

### The Ayurvedic method of treatment

1. Ayurvedic treatment involves applying therapies of opposite nature to relieve conditions.
   * Vata imbalance manifests as coldness, dryness, lightness, and agitation.
   * Opposite therapies include rich nutritive diet, warm oil massage, rest, and relaxation.
2. Pratipaksha-Bhavana: treating psychological imbalances with opposite qualities to restore balance.
3. Consciousness shaped by food, impressions, and associations.

8. Avoid relying on substances that mask conditions but cannot resolve them.

## 11. The Cycle of Nutrition for the Mind: The Role of Impressions

1. *Mind is an organic entity, part of Nature*
2. *Healthy mind = right nutrition (impressions)*
3. Food for the mind builds energy, shapes consciousness
4. Three levels of mental nutrition: Physical, Subtle, Causal

**Physical Nutrition:**
1. Nourishes brain and nerve tissue
2. Gross elements (earth, water, fire, air, ether) build body and mind indirectly
3. Earth element builds heavy matter, grounds and stabilizes the mind

**Subtle Nutrition:**
1. Impressions and experiences through senses
2. Colors, shapes, sounds constitute subtle elements
3. Five sensory potentials build outer mind (Manas) and indirectly inner mind (Chitta)
4. Sensory impressions color thoughts, affect feelings
5. Mind itself brings in mental and emotional impressions

**Causal Nutrition:**
1. Deepest level of nutrition for the mind
2. Three gunas (Sattva, Rajas, Tamas) determine nature of deeper consciousness (Chitta)
3. Gross and subtle elements affect deeper consciousness according to their constituent gunas
4. Right relationships crucial in treating the mind
7. Sattvic food, impressions, associations activate love, clarity, peace
8. Rajasic food, impressions, associations activate passion, criticalness, agitation
9. Tamasic food, impressions, associations activate insensitivity, ignorance, inertia
10. Chitta is the ultimate product of digestion of food, impressions, and associations.

### Mental Digestion

1. *Mental Digestion*: Consider both the nature of mental intake and our capacity to process it.
2. *Outer Mind (Manas)*: Gathers impressions from senses; corresponds to stomach in physical body.
3. *Intelligence (Buddhi)*: Digests experiences; corresponds to small intestine.
4. *Digestion Process*: Impressions -> Outer Mind -> Intelligence -> Deeper Consciousness (Chitta).
5. *Proper Mental Digestion*: Truth discernment, release of Sattva guna.
6. *Improper Mental Digestion*: Inability to break down names and forms into truth energies; accumulation in mind, blocking perception.
7. *Impact on Consciousness (Chitta)*: Properly digested experiences leave peace and clarity; improperly digested experiences damage the substance of the mind and influence current state until resolved.

### The Three States of Waking, Dream, and Deep Sleep. 
1. *Waking State*: Impressions gathered through outer mind (Manas) and senses.
2. *Dream State*: Mental digestion of impressions through inner intelligence (Buddhi). Reflected in various dreams.
3. *Deep Sleep*: Residue of digested impressions becomes part of deeper consciousness (Chitta). Good deep sleep indicates well-developed body of consciousness.

#### Detoxification for the Mind

Prevent wrong impressions, develop strong intelligence to digest properly. Stop intake of mental toxins and burn up absorbed ones with intelligence.

- *Physical Level Detoxification*: Eliminate toxic accumulations through excretion, urination, sweating, Ayurvedic measures, fasting.
- *Subtle Level Detoxification*: Pranayama eliminates negative impressions (subtle elements) through special sweating and fasting from emotions.
- *Causal Level Detoxification*: Mantras change Rajasic and Tamasic patterns in deeper consciousness, making it receptive to higher influences. No release of gunas but they can be transformed with Sattvic mantras like OM.

### Cultivating the Field of Consciousness.
1. *Consciousness (Chitta)* is a field that can be cultivated based on what we put into it.
2. If cultivated with good experiences, bad habits will not thrive. Conversely, if filled with bad experiences, even good thoughts may struggle.
3. The mind is like a deep well; whatever we put in grows and eventually influences our actions.
4. We must be careful in what we feed our minds as the results manifest over time.
5. Ayurveda emphasizes three factors of mental nutrition: proper food, air, and impressions.
6. Impressions influence behavior directly and can be observed in dreams.
7. The mind is sensitive to impressions, which feed our life-force and motivate actions.
8. Disturbed impressions cause disturbed expressions; peaceful impressions cause peaceful expressions.
9. We can discriminate against wrong impressions through the proper function of intelligence.
10. Mental disorders can be cured through the intake of right impressions, making it a simple way to change the mental field.

### Signs of Proper Intake of Impressions
1. *Acuity of sensory functioning* and control of imagination are signs of proper intake of impressions.
2. Proper intake leads to deep sleep with spiritual dreams, lack of need for entertainment, clear perception, capacity for creative expression, mental lightness, peace, and luminosity.
3. Improper intake is characterized by *improper functioning of the senses*, disturbed imagination, disturbed sleep with frequent or agitated dreams, craving for violent or disturbed entertainment, unclear perception, lack of creativity, mental heaviness, disturbance, and darkness.
4. Mother nature is the main source of positive impressions.
5. Modern psychological unrest is due to alienation from Nature.
6. Negative impressions come primarily from mass media and artificial environments.
7. Positive impressions can be gained through home environment and general environment.
8. Home environment should have beauty and harmony for mental nourishment.
9. A healing or sacred space in the house can be created for spiritual and creative activity.
10. Communion with nature is essential for individual life-force healing.
11. Workplace should incorporate higher impressions through altars or gardens.
12. Social interaction can bring higher impressions through spiritual places, chants, rituals, or meditations in a group.

### Sound and Emotion.
Any sensation we take personally produces an emotion, with sound being the most primary sensory potential. Stronger emotions demand stronger sounds.

1. **Mantras and Emotions**: Mantras produce a certain emotional force or force of feeling, allowing us to become conscious of our emotions and exercise them creatively and consciously.

## Part IV - SPIRITUAL APPLICATIONS OF AYURVEDIC PSYCHOLOGY

1. Two main aspects of spirituality in Yoga and Ayurveda: Devotion and Self-knowledge.
2. *Devotion*: foundation for Self-knowledge, spontaneous love for the Divine.
3. *Self-knowledge*: highest orientation of intelligence, seeking true nature.
4. Practice of devotion is essential for a fulfilling spiritual journey.
5. Without devotion, psychology is dry and intellectual.
6. Background of Yoga: outer practices (ethics, Asana, Pranayama).
7. Inner and deeper practices of Yoga take us beyond ordinary psychology to spiritual psychology.

### Devotion and the Place of God.

1. Ayurveda emphasizes the role of God (Ishvara), the creator and ultimate healer.
2. God is the manifest aspect of Brahman, ruling time-space creation.
3. God is an inner reality, our guide to self and well-being.
4. God is not limited to a specific form; He/She is also Divine grace (Shakti).
5. God exists in all nature, animate and inanimate.
6. God is personal and impersonal, formless and contained in forms.
7. God works through Cosmic Intelligence, respects intelligence, and is open to communication.
8. Contacting God is through meditation with an open mind and heart.
9. We should do homage to God as we exist under His laws.
10. Love is the force making life worth living; it depends on relationship.
11. Most psychological problems stem from a lack of love due to limited relationships.
12. Desire is an empty, needy state seeking love from outside, while love is a full and overflowing state derived from within.
13. We should strive to give love instead of seeking it externally.
14. Lack of devotion is the root cause of psychological problems; having devotion ensures no significant issues.

### Surrender
1. *Surrender*: We cannot solve psychological problems through personal power. Selfishness and external love seeking lead to inner discontentment. Surrender is key to going beyond problems.
2. *Higher Power*: There's a guiding power in control of things, including our bodies and the universe. Surrender to this power for relief from problems.
3. *Compassion and Devotion*: Two sides of higher feeling capacity. Feel devotion to Divine and compassion for all creatures.
4. *Compulsion vs. Compassion*: Compassion is feeling together with others, not pity or trying to help without self-awareness.
5. *Forms of Devotion*: God can be worshipped in various forms based on personal preference, often as the Divine Mother for her love and grace.
6. *Devotion and Self-Realization*: Devotion is part of seeking to know our true inner Self, which is God. Once realized, we transcend Nature and God as external realities.

### Developing Devotion
1. **Devotion Development**: Choose a specific form of God for worship to cultivate devotion.
2. **Relationship with God**: Decide on a relationship with God (father, mother, friend, etc.) and choose a corresponding form.

5. **Rituals**: Perform daily rituals and offerings to consecrate healing practices and purify the mind.
6. **Prayer and Mantra**: Communicate with God through prayers and mantras, seeking guidance and help.
7. **Deities and Psychology**: Worship deities as personifications of archetypes and cosmic forces within our psyche.
8. **Lord Shiva**: In Ayurveda, Lord Shiva is the main deity for dealing with psychological disorders due to his power over negative forces in the mind.
9. **Specific Deities**: Worship specific deities like Rudra (anger), Kali (fear), Lakshmi (love and joy), Rama (fearlessness), Ganesha (intelligence), Hanuman (higher life-force) for various psychological needs.
10. **Buddhism**: Similar practices exist in Buddhism with Bodhisattvas.
11. **Ancient Religions**: Ancient Greek, Egyptian, and Babylonian religions also used deities for similar purposes.
12. **Apollo**: Worshipped to develop powers of intelligence, creativity, and enlightenment.

### Formless Devotion

1. Formless Devotion:
   - Some prefer formless worship without a specific God form.
   - Uses relationships (father, mother, etc.) and Divine names/mantras.
   - Requires a relationship with the Divine.
   - Can also focus on revering Divine qualities.
   - Combining form-oriented and formless devotion is best.
2. Developing Compassion:
   - Considering greater problems of the world helps.
   - None of us have personal problems, only a personal form of human problem.
   - Practices include daily prayers for peace and alleviation of suffering.
   - Engage in service ventures.
3. Devotion and the Mind:
   - Highly intellectual people may view devotion as emotional weakness.
   - Devotion vitalizes the mind, preventing it from being dry or self-destructive.
4. Self-knowledge:
   - True psychology is understanding one's true Self.
   - Different conceptions of the self in various systems of psychology.
   - Ayurveda looks beyond body and mind to changeless awareness.
   - Self-knowledge means understanding the full extent of our being.
5. Developing Self-Knowledge:
   - Requires meditation and observing oneself.
   - Trace sense of self back to its origin in spiritual heart.
   - Learn who we are beyond external conditioning factors.
6. Thought and Self-knowledge:
   - Consists of "I" and what it is identified with.
   - Problems arise from identification with objects, not being itself.
7. Psychology and Self-knowledge:
   - Helps understand outer layers of our being but should not trap us within them.
   - Requires a calm and balanced mind for effective practice.

## 16. The Eightfold Method of Yoga I: Outer Practices 

1. **Calming our Deeper Consciousness**: Our deeper consciousness contains emotional traumas and pains that disturb us, which must be calmed to achieve peace at the core of the mind. This requires emptying the mind of its contents, deep-seated habits, tendencies, attachments, fear, anger, and desire on all levels.
2. **Reorienting and Sharpening our Intelligence**: Intelligence must be redirected from an external orientation to the inner world of consciousness. We need to discriminate between the eternal and transient, real and unreal, and our true Self from ego appearances. This requires perceiving the three gunas (qualities) and holding onto Satva while discarding Rajas and Tamas.
3. **Controlling the Mind**: We must control our mind and senses to avoid being pulled outwardly by them in search of external fulfillment. This requires cultivating self-control, character, and willpower. As long as the mind brings external impressions into consciousness, it cannot empty itself out. Similarly, as long as we are looking outward through the mind, we cannot redirect our intelligence within.
4. **Dissolving the Ego**: The root of all expansion of consciousness lies in dissolving the ego or sense of separate self, which is limiting and isolated. This requires self-abnegation, surrender to God, and awakening our inner self and soul sense.
5. **Balancing and Strengthening the Vital-Force**: Our Prana or life-energy becomes bound by attachments and involvement that disturb us. To free the mind, this Prana must be released as well. Our vital force (Prana) must be freed from its fixation on external objects to avoid drawing our minds outward and losing our energy of attention.
6. **Purifying the Body**: The body must be cleansed of toxins and excesses of the biological humors of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. A toxic or weak body will pull down the mind and weaken the vital force. The body is the repository of our actions and holds their long-term effects; therefore, it cannot be ignored in working with the mind or deeper consciousness.

### Samadhi the Eighth Limb of Yoga

1. Samadhi is the last and highest limb of Yoga, defined as absorption or merging with things in consciousness.
2. There are two types of Samadhi: preliminary (with form or thought) and higher (thought-free).
3. Sustained meditation leads to Samadhi, which requires profound contemplation and may take decades to manifest.
4. Ayurvedic psychology lays the foundation for yogic Samadhi by addressing psychological imbalances.
5. Lesser Samadhis are peak experiences of absorption in an object or activity, while greater Samadhi involves calming the mind beyond all objects and thoughts.
6. Yoga is concerned with Samadhi on the last two levels of consciousness (one-pointed and calmed), which are purely Sattvic (spiritual) in nature.
7. Lesser Samadhis are transient, dependent on circumstances, and can lead to mental disturbances due to attachment and addiction.

### Samadhis of the Deluded Mind

1. **Samadhis of the Deluded Mind**: Sleep, comas, alcohol or drug-induced states where consciousness of the body is obscured or lost. Prevails with the quality of Tamas (dullness). Absorbed in a blank state or sensation without movement.
2. **Samadhis of the Distracted Mind**: Occurs when mind is engrossed in an activity or external sensation, forgetting itself. Quality of Rajas (energetic movement) prevails. Engrossed in work, sexual activity, sports, movies, intense emotions like fear or pain.
3. **Samadhis of the Imaginative Mind**: Absorbed in own projections, forgetting self. Prevails with the quality of Sattva (purity). Includes artistic visions, philosophical musings, scientific discoveries. Cannot purify mind fully as Rajas and Tamas still present.
4. **Lesser Samadhis**: Powerful experiences of life to which we get addicted, cause sorrow. Mind gets trapped in influence of peak experiences or moments of intensity. Determines background state of mind and external conditions.
5. **Mixed Samadhis**: Combination of three lower Samadhis due to fluctuating gunas behind these states. Generally lead to a Tamasic state when exhausted.
6. **Deluded, Distracted, and Imaginative Samadhis** are not considered ultimate in Yoga as they cannot fully purify the mind. Requires more than cultivation of intellect; requires yogic training and realization.

### Schizophrenia

1. Schizophrenia is a lower form of Samadhi, often dominated by delusion (Tamas).
2. Symptoms include trances, hallucinations, delusory sensory phenomena, loss of contact with physical realities, and psychic abilities or sensitivities beyond control.
3. Severe mental derangement involves possessions by influences or entities, causing a loss of conscious control.
4. Spiritual experiences can be authentic but mixed with egoism (lower Samadhis).
5. Desire-based Samadhis are externally directed and intermediate in nature.
6. Samadhi occurs when the mind becomes fully absorbed in Prana or vital energy.
7. Prana is of three types: Sattvic, Rajasic, and Tamasic.
8. Sattvic Prana operates during states of inspiration and creative insight.
9. Rajasic Prana operates during motor activities, sensory experiences, and strong exertion.
10. Tamasic Prana operates in states of sleep, stupor, coma, and under the influence of drugs.
11. Pranayama is important for creating yogic Samadhis by uniting the mind and Prana consciously.
12. Psychoanalysis often fails because it does not address the level of Prana and Chitta (subconscious mind).
13. Releasing the Prana behind psychological states can be achieved through practicing Pranayama.

### Samadhi and Ayurvedic Psychology. Ayurvedic psychology examines the lower

1. Ayurvedic psychology focuses on lower Samadhis and their impact on the psyche, using methods like diet and meditation to neutralize their conditioning.
2. Only higher Samadhis can completely neutralize the effects of lower ones.
3. Yogic practices develop higher spiritual Samskaras (mental tendencies) to counteract lower ones based on desire, disturbance, and illusion.
4. Lesser mental disorders often involve attachment to a lesser Samadhi, requiring development of a higher type of absorption for treatment.
5. Ayurvedic psychological therapies help individuals discover more wholesome Samadhis.
6. The Eightfold Yogic Path:
   - Yamas: Values of social conduct (ahimsa, truthfulness, non-stealing, continence, and non-possessiveness).
