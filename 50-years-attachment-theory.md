## SIR RICHARD BOWLBY

- Not a psychologist, designed racing cars
- Lived close to father all his life
- Realized more about father through Attachment Theory
- Disappointed by lack of widespread acceptance of Attachment Theory

**Background of Attachment Theory**

- Developed by Sir Richard Bowlby's father, John Bowlby
- Based on research into parent-child attachment relationship
- Originally called "research into bonding"
- Motivated by his own experience of losing a surrogate mother figure, Minnie, at age 4

**Early Influences and Education**

- Father was a successful surgeon with six children
- Children had twenty-three hour care from nannies and nursemaids
- Father grew attached to his nursemaid, Minnie
- When Minnie left, father felt pain but not traumatized
- Met John Alford at age 21, who inspired interest in maternal deprivation

**Maternal Deprivation Research**

- Studied forty-four juvenile thieves and found seventeen had experienced early separation from mother or mother substitute
- Identified disrupted childhoods by recording only death, desertion, or divorce in families
- Confronted intimidating figures throughout his career, including during psychoanalytic training

**Maternal Care and Mental Health (1951)**

- Report on psychiatric needs of homeless children after WWII
- Published as "Child Care and the Growth of Love" in 1952
- Emphasized need for warm, intimate relationship between infant and mother or permanent mother substitute

**Development of Attachment Theory**

- First used term "attachment" in a publication in 1957
- Clarified use of "permanent mother substitute" as one person who steadily mothers the child
- Did not clarify use of "continuous," leading to controversy later on
- Index of "Child Care and the Growth of Love" does not include attachment

**Struggles in Gaining Acceptance**

- Not widely accepted despite its research basis and potential benefits for society
- Some people had emotional difficulties with the concept
- Wider social issues prevented acceptance
- Those with secure attachments found it self-explanatory and obvious
- Preferred to call it "research into bonding" instead of "Attachment Theory" due to negative connotations associated with the term "theory"

**John Bowlby and Attachment Theory**

- John Bowlby noticed that children with disrupted childhoods often exhibited persistent issues such as theft and truancy (Video Clip)
- "Continuous relationship" between a mother and child promotes mental health (Bowlby, 1953)
  * Distinguish between "enduring relationship" and "unbroken contact"
  * Originally addressed complete maternal deprivation or prolonged separation in orphanages
- Misunderstanding of "prolonged separation"
  * Figes (1998) equated working mothers with prolonged separation, causing confusion
  * Bowlby's pamphlet "Can I Leave my Baby?" (1958) clarified position but damage had already been done

**Prolonged Separation and Attachment Theory**

- Mother's absence for some hours a day not the same as prolonged separation
  * Prolonged separation: complete and prolonged separation, six months or more
- Importance of continuity in caregiving
  * Regular caregiver preferred
  * Child becomes attached to caregiver if relationship is continuous
- Impact of discontinued relationships
  * Loss of primary attachment figure can be tragic for a child
  * Child may form attachment to new caregiver but instability can cause distress

**Bowlby's Personal Experience and "Continuous" Relationships**

- Bowlby's own experience with Minnie, his nanny, influenced his views on continuous relationships
- He did not define "continuous" in his pamphlet despite its importance to his theory
  * Possible blind spot due to personal experiences

**Video Clip of John Bowlby**

- In video clip, Bowlby refers to his mother as grandmother (Freudian slip)

## INTERVIEW

**John Bowlby's Interview on Attachment Theory and Nannies**

**Background:**
- John Bowlby, a British psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, is known for developing Attachment Theory.
- Attachment Theory states that people form strong emotional bonds with one primary attachment figure during critical periods of development.

**Interview:**

_Question:_ Do you think a nanny intervenes in the relationship between a mother and her child?

_Answer:_ Not necessarily, but it depends on the continuity and personal relationship between the nanny and mother. If each has their own role, there is no problem. However, if they compete or if the nanny leaves frequently, it can be traumatic for the child.

**Attachment Theory:**
- People show a preference for one primary attachment figure above all others.
- The primary attachment figure is usually the biological mother but could be anyone who takes on the long-term commitment of raising the child.
- Multiple attachment figures exist, arranged in a hierarchy with the primary attachment figure at the top.

**Importance of Primary Attachment Figure:**
- A child's emotional security and wellbeing are determined by the accessibility and responsiveness of their principal attachment figure.
- The initial primary attachment figure should be accessible for many years, preferably into adulthood.

**Inspiration for Attachment Theory:**
- John Bowlby was inspired by Konrad Lorenz's work on imprinting in birds.
- Imprinting is the behavior of young animals following the first moving object they see during a critical period.
- This behavior reminded Bowlby of the instinct to form close relationships that stays with us throughout our lives.

**Attachment Theory and Childcare:**
- Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, an anthropologist, used Attachment Theory to arrange day care for her baby.
- High-quality substitute care can be beneficial if the initial primary attachment figure is not accessible for many years.

### The Nature of the Childâ€™s Tie to its Mother

- In 1951, John Bowlby presented a paper called "The Nature of the Childâ€™s Tie to its Mother" to the British PsychoAnalytic Society (BPAS) outlining Attachment Theory.
- The reception was hostile, with many psychoanalysts questioning its relevance to their field.
- This marked a turning point in Bowlby's career as he was challenging established theories of Klein and Freud while proposing an alternative theory.
- Psychoanalysts, many with personal traumas, may have found this new theory deeply disturbing.
- Years later, in 1987, Bowlby acknowledged the long journey to develop Attachment Theory:
  - Seeds were sown when he was four years old.
  - He was forty-six when he published "Child Care and the Growth of Love."
  - Completed the Attachment trilogy at seventy-three.

**Background**

- Bowlby's guiding principle: "If the theory doesn't fit the data, change the theory, not the data."
- Took years to develop a theory that incorporated all research data.
- Started writing the three volumes only after this.

**Impact and Reception**

- Bowlby's forthright manner made him a champion for some but a pariah for others.
- Limited meeting of minds due to opposing viewpoints.

**Quotes**

- "I have found it extremely unfashionable to attribute psychopathology to real-life experiences." - John Bowlby, 1987.
- "In The Female Eunuch I argued that motherhood should not be treated as a substitute career; now I would argue that motherhood should be regarded as a genuine career option." - Germaine Greer, 2002.

**John Bowlby's Perspective on Child Rearing**

- Approximately 60% of mothers do an excellent job in raising children, providing a good model for others (Majority of women have a good model to follow)
- 40% of mothers do not do a good job, leading to mental health issues, disturbances, delinquency, etc.

**Principles for Optimum Mental Health for Children Under Three**

- A resourceful parent (usually but not necessarily the biological mother) who stays at home
- Parent should be happy to stay at home
- Parent must have adequate emotional, practical, and financial support
- Both parent and child find satisfaction and enjoyment

**John Bowlby's Interaction with Xenia**

- Xenia was a full-time, stay-at-home mother of John Bowlby's grandchildren
- Only gave her advice once in 1968 when she was under peer pressure to stop providing "comfort on demand" for their two-year-old
- Advised her to continue as she was and ignore others' opinions

**Modern Application**

- Sophie and her husband Matt recently had a baby and bought a house within three miles of John Bowlby's house while raising their child.

### Financial and Emotional Obstacles

**Two Major Changes in Society**

1. **Dramatic increase in wealth and living standards:** Compared to the 1940s and 1950s, society enjoys a higher standard of living.
2. **Equal opportunities movement:** Opened up new possibilities for education, employment, and social advancement based on factors other than race, gender, age, class, or creed.

**Financial Pressures on New Families**

- **Raised expectations**: People want to provide high standards for their families.
- **Expensive lifestyle**: Housing, technology, entertainment, etc., require significant financial resources.
- **Limited choices**: Financial pressures force many parents to continue working throughout their child-rearing years.

**Emotional Sensitivity of New Parents**

- Personal experiences: Discussions about attachment often focus on personal memories and experiences.
- Unconscious memories: Memories of childhood are often stored at the unconscious level, making some parents uncomfortable when triggered.

**Day Care Controversy**

- NICHD day care study: Findings suggest that the more time spent in day care, the more likely children are to exhibit aggressive and disobedient behavior.
- Impact on many: Although the findings are not strong, they could have significant social implications for a large number of children.
- Parental reactions: Many parents who have no choice but to work may find these findings painful and unwelcome.

**Comparison with Historical Precedents**

- Sir Richard Bowlby compares the reaction to Belsky's findings to his father's delivery of uncomfortable messages in the past.
- Belsky acknowledges the comparison and agrees that there might be a connection due to the initials.

**Culture and Nuclear Family**

* Glorification of nuclear family independence
* Denigration of interdependence in extended families
* Peer pressure for mothers to return to work promptly after maternity break
* Financial commitments requiring both parents to work

**Advantages of Modern Childcare Arrangements**

* Social development through interaction with other infants
* Improved standard of living with two-income parents
* Larger vocabulary and readiness for pre-school facilities
* Working parents less depressed and isolated
* High-quality day care can compensate for poor family environment

**Childcare Professionals and Advantages**

* More experienced in stimulating babies

**Problems with Modern Day Care Arrangements**

* Parents less sensitive to baby's cues for attention
* Only one in ten day care places are high-quality
* Affordability and availability of high-quality day care
* Increased aggression in infants as they spend more time apart from parents
* Negative impact on emotional development when multiple care-workers look after a baby
* Lasting emotional scars from separating small children from attachment figures

### Fifty Years of Attachment Theory

- In 1987, on his eightieth birthday, **Boston Globe** quoted **father's interview** expressing concern about mothers in the U.S. unable to afford proper care for their babies despite being in the richest country in the world.
  - He believed society overlooked the time and emotional investment required for enriching parenting.
  - Warned against repeating past pitfalls with intelligent application of **Attachment Theory**.
- **Mothers' financial struggles** and the importance of emotionally enriching parenting are powerful attachment issues.
  - Discussing these topics is difficult due to:
    - Personal experiences and past attachments.
    - Long-term mental health implications for children.
- **Attachment Theory**: scientifically proven evidence concerning the long-term mental health of children.
  - People's own past attachment experiences can hinder understanding.
- **Good enough parenting** is a complex issue:
  - How to be a good enough parent?
  - Reflection on our own parents and their parenting.
  - Will our children become good enough parents?
  - Definition of a good enough parent.
- The irony lies in the fact that people's past attachment experiences can prevent them from fully understanding Attachment Theory.

### Children learn from their parents

- Children learn significantly from being apprenticed to their parents: boys to fathers, girls to mothers (common pattern)
- Children thrive with adult attention, affection, and company
- Parental attitudes towards children are crucial for their development
- Many children unfortunately do not receive adequate parental attention
- **Attachment Theory:**
  - Emotional and social development focus
  - Father, John Bowlby's work
  - Polarized opinions: some against, others in favor
  - Misrepresentation and ridicule in popular media
  - Personal memories of painful childhood issues
  - Anxiety about long-term consequences for own children

**Issues with the Public Perception of Attachment Theory**

1. **Lack of concern from securely attached individuals:** Not directly affected by attachment theory
2. **Misrepresentation in media:** Polarized opinions, destructive to understanding
3. **Personal childhood issues:** Insights may evoke painful memories
4. **Anxiety about long-term consequences:** Limited parenting choices and impact on own children

**Research Data on Attachment Theory**

- Unassailable research data exists on many aspects of attachment theory
- Large conferences dedicated to the topic, with significant attendance

**Challenges in Communicating Attachment Theory to the Public**

- Ordinary people still struggle to understand emotional and social development of their children
- Need to find new ways to help the general public benefit from attachment theory knowledge.

## QUESTIONS TO SIR RICHARD BOWLBY

**Reason for Wider Recognition:**

- Cultural phenomenon: Americans are more oriented towards psychoanalytic theories and quicker to accept new ideas.
- Resonance with American society's experiences and backgrounds.
- High regard for Mary Ainsworth, a co-founder of Attachment Theory, in America.

**Split Families:**

- Growing number of families experiencing disintegration due to one parent leaving.
- Children often bear the brunt of family disintegration and suffer greatly from attachment splits.
- Difficult area with limited information on long-term effects.
- Adults tend to avoid thinking about the child's experience and focus on their own defense mechanisms.

**Effects of Family Disintegration:**

- Children may cope poorly, leading to potential negative long-term consequences.
- Lack of primary attachment figure can impact children's development and education.
- Current fashion in education with frequent testing from an early age could have detrimental effects on children.

**Scandinavian Day Care System:**

- Young children attend school but do not engage in traditional "schoolwork."
- Teachers facilitate acquisition of interpersonal skills, cooperation, and problem-solving abilities.
- Learning social cohesion at a young age is valuable for future development.
