# LEARNING DSM-5 BY CASE EXAMPLE by Michael B. First, Andrew E. Skodol 

> With at least one case presentation for each of the mental disorders catalogued in DSM-5 -- and multiple cases for nearly half of the disorders -- Learning DSM-5(R) by Case Example has been meticulously designed to aid practitioners and students of all levels in psychology, psychiatry, social work, counseling, and psychiatric nursing develop internalized prototypes of DSM-5 disorders by first describing each disorder in relatable terms and subsequently illustrating how these symptom constellations manifest in real-life settings using clinical case material.
> 
> The nearly 200 cases featured in this guide are drawn from the authors' own clinical experience, as well as that of well over 100 clinicians, many of whom are well-known experts in particular areas of diagnosis and treatment. Sensitive to the fact that one of the hallmarks of mental disorders is the wide range of presentations that are encountered in a real-world setting, many of the disorders described include multiple cases that vary in symptom presentation, gender, age, clinical course, associated impairment in psychosocial functioning, and developmental factors, thus giving readers an appreciation for the heterogeneity typical of these disorders. Each case is complemented by a discussion that elaborates the ways in which the case conforms to the DSM-5 prototype or highlights those features of the case that illustrate the heterogeneity.
> 
> With definitions of potentially unfamiliar medical and psychiatric terms, Learning DSM-5(R) by Case Example is an accessible resource for readers of all disciplines. And because it guides the reader through the organizational structure of DSM-5, it is also an ideal reference for courses on psychopathology or abnormal psychology. - [Learning DSM-5 by Case Example 1st Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-DSM-5-Example-Michael-First/dp/1615370161/&tag=cognitivetech-20)

## Introduction

**Introduction**

**Purpose:**
- Helps students learn DSM-5 diagnoses using case examples
- Accelerates development of clinical prototypes
- Describes each disorder in prototype terms and illustrates presentations in real cases

**Case Selection:**
- Includes cases from various disciplines: psychology, psychiatry, social work, counseling, nursing
- Represents diagnostic heterogeneity for many disorders
- Does not include separate cases for Mental Disorders Due to Another Medical Condition or Substance/Medication-Induced Mental Disorders, as their presentations are conceptually the same and differ only in terms of symptoms and causative agents. However, some representative cases are included: Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, Personality Change Due to Another Medical Condition, Methylphenidate-Induced Psychotic Disorder, Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder, Ofloxacin-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder, Caffeine/Aminophylline/Albuterol/Beclomethasone-Induced Sleep Disorder, Paroxetine-Induced Sexual Dysfunction, Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium, and Alcohol-Induced Major Neurocognitive Disorder.

**Diagnostic Approach:**
- Clinicians often make diagnoses based on matching symptoms to internalized prototypes rather than applying diagnostic criteria systematically
- This book aims to create these clinical prototypes by describing each DSM-5 disorder in prototype terms and illustrating presentations in real cases

**Case Organization:**
- Cases are organized according to the order of diagnostic groupings as they appear in DSM-5
- Some chapters rearrange the order for educational purposes.

**Intended Audience:**
- Primarily designed for students, but also useful for experienced clinicians, other professionals, and historically interested readers
- Includes an alphabetical index of diagnoses to help readers find cases based on DSM-5 diagnosis given.

## Chapter 1. Neurodevelopmental Disorders. 
### INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES.
#### 1.1 Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder)

**Neurodevelopmental Disorders:** Intellectual Disabilities

**Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder)**
- Characterized by deficits in general mental abilities, such as reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience
- Impairments of adaptive functioning, including personal independence and social responsibility in various aspects of daily life (communication, social participation, academic or occupational functioning, personal independence)
- Diagnosis based on clinical assessment and individually administered, psychometrically valid IQ tests with scores approximately two standard deviations below the population mean
- Adaptive functioning involves three domains: conceptual (academic), social, and practical

**Characteristics of Intellectual Disability:**
- Deficits in intellectual functions
- Difficulties in acquisition and use of language
- Interference with speech intelligibility or prevention of verbal communication
- Disturbance in normal fluency and time patterning of speech
- Difficulties in social use of verbal and nonverbal communication
- Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities
- Patterns of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity
- Some symptoms present prior to age 12 years
- Present in two or more settings (home, school, work, friends, relatives, other activities)
- Difficulties learning and using academic skills
- Acquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills substantially below expected age level
- Repetitive, driven, and seemingly purposeless motor behavior
- Sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization

**Intellectual Disability:**
- Affects 1% of the general population
- Males more likely to be affected than females
- Deficits have an onset during the developmental period but may not be present at birth
- Causes: genetic (Down syndrome), illnesses (meningitis, encephalitis, head trauma) or acquired
- Levels of severity: mild, moderate, severe, or profound based on adaptive functioning in conceptual, social, and practical domains
- Global Developmental Delay is a diagnosis for individuals under age 5 who cannot be reliably assessed for intellectual disability severity level.

##### Down Syndrome

**Case Study: Eric's Behavioral Issues**

**Background:**
- Eric, a 15-year-old boy with Down Syndrome (DS)
- Parents divorced for 4 years, father lives in another city
- Previous residential placements since age 8 due to intellectual impairments and behavioral issues
- Mother brought him home 6 months ago, but he was destructive and aggressive towards her during this time

**Symptoms:**
- Destructive of property: breaking dishes, chair
- Physically assaultive: hit mother during scuffles
- Increasing behavior problems since birth
- Signs of Down Syndrome: thick facial features, slightly protruding tongue, epicanthal fold, simian crease on palms
- Indistinct and slurred speech
- Insisted he "didn't mean to hurt anybody"

**Diagnosis:**
1. **Intellectual Disability (ID)** due to Down Syndrome:
   - Significant deficits or impairments in adaptive functioning
   - IQ of 45 indicates general intellectual functioning deficits
   - Diagnose regardless of other diagnoses
2. **Down Syndrome:**
   - Additional diagnosis alongside ID
   - Causes Intellectual Disability since birth
3. Possible Diagnosis: **Conduct Disorder (CD)**
   - Not justified due to lack of characteristic features
4. Presenting issue is destructive and aggressive behavior, not intellectual functioning impairment.

##### The Enigma

**The Enigma**

**Psychiatrist's Consultation**:
- Psychiatrist received a call from a pediatric colleague about 17-year-old Libby
- Described as "cured from depression" and needing only follow-up medication
- Arrival at the clinic was marked by her agitated, restless behavior and high-pitched unintelligible screaming

**Patient Profile**:
- Diagnosed with severe mental retardation under 1 year of age
- Extensive diagnostic evaluations failed to determine the etiology of her intellectual deficits
- Physically healthy, only child, reared at home, attended special classes in public schools
- Cheerful, friendly, and affectionate, nonverbal but communicated through gestures and vocalizations
- Learned household tasks, helped mother around the house
- Previously cheerful demeanor changed 6 months ago when parents went on a weeklong vacation
- Became agitated, unresponsive, cried frequently, slept poorly, ate little, spent time aimlessly roaming the house
- Parents felt guilty and tried to make amends by spending all their time with her
- Attempted to give her attention and affection, but this only made matters worse
- Pediatrician gave her an antianxiety drug, which had no effect

**Previous Treatments**:
- School psychologist thought her behavior was an attention-getting device, so referred the family to a child guidance clinic
- Child psychiatrist suggested giving Libby unlimited attention and affection, but this also made matters worse
- Another psychiatrist diagnosed her as depressed and prescribed antidepressant medication, which also did not improve her condition
- Libby was hospitalized on a pediatric ward, where extensive medical evaluation failed to disclose the cause of her condition

**Current Treatment**:
- Pediatrician treated Libby for "psychotic depression" and increased the antidepressant medication and added an antipsychotic drug
- This led to some improvement, but she suffered a relapse and needed to be hospitalized again
- Family history revealed that a maternal aunt suffered from depression and responded well to lithium treatment
- Libby was started on lithium, which gradually improved her condition and allowed the antipsychotic medication to be discontinued

**Discussion**:
- Difficulty in diagnosing people with Severe Intellectual Disability who are unable to describe their subjective experiences
- Libby's behavior was dismissed as a "nonspecific behavior disorder" or "exhibition of attention-getting behaviors due to overprotection by parents"
- Her clinical presentation was dominated by irritable mood, agitation, distractibility, and sleep disturbance - all of which are included in the diagnostic criteria for Manic Episode
- Symptoms such as grandiosity, flight of ideas, and excessive involvement in pleasurable activity could not be described by a severely intellectually challenged and nonverbal person
- The clinical presentation was cyclic, with periods of crying, decreased activities, loss of appetite, and insomnia - all suggestive of Major Depressive Disorder
- Family history was positive for a lithium-responding "depression," suggesting Libby may have been in a Major Depressive Episode when put on the antidepressant medication, which then triggered manic symptoms

### COMMUNICATION DISORDERS
#### 1.2 Language Disorder

**Language Disorder (LD)**
- Characterized by persistent difficulties in language acquisition and use across modalities due to deficits in comprehension or production (DSM-5, p. 42)

**Symptoms:**
- Reduced vocabulary
- Limited sentence structure
- Impairment in discourse
- Difficulties not age-appropriate
- Interferes with social and academic functioning
- Not due to hearing problems, motor dysfunctions, other medical or neurological conditions, or Intellectual Disability

**Types:**
- Expressive abilities (production of verbal material)
- Receptive abilities (understanding of language messages)
- Both expressive and receptive abilities

**Prognosis:**
- Language Disorder present at age 4 years likely to persist into adulthood
- Children with receptive language impairments have a poorer prognosis than those with only expressive problems

**Case Studies:**
1. **Don:**
   - Born 11 weeks premature with hyaline membrane disease
   - Complicated medical history including bilateral hernia repairs
   - Developmental milestones within normal limits until age 3 years and 7 months
   - Slow to warm up during examination
   - Extremely difficult to understand, had to use gestures for clarification
   - Most sentences consisted of single words or mispronounced speech (e.g., "dub" instead of "gun")
   - Limited vocabulary (e.g., "fish" = "pet")
   - Could follow commands and produce drawings sophisticated for age
   - No difficulty understanding language, suggestive of expressive type LD
2. **Zach:**
   - Evaluated due to problems in school
   - Difficulties getting along with children and teacher throughout kindergarten
   - Improvement seen recently with play skills but still had trouble understanding instructions and expressing himself verbally
   - Quiet and shy during examination, mother had to remain in the room for support
   - Limited verbalizations (only told examiner his name)
   - Inappropriate responses during tasks, unclear grasp of task purpose
   - Absence of bizarre behavior rules out Autism Spectrum Disorder
   - Diagnosis: Language Disorder involving both reception and expression.

#### 1.3 Speech Sound Disorder

**Speech Sound Disorder (SSD)**
- Characteristic feature: persistent difficulty with speech sound production that interferes with intelligibility or prevents verbal communication
- Interferes with social activities and academic achievement
- Not caused by congenital or acquired conditions, such as cleft palate, cerebral palsy, hearing loss, or traumatic brain injury
- Onset in early developmental period
- Most children have intelligible speech by age 3 and speak most words correctly by age 7
- Speech problems usually improve with treatment

**Diagnosis of SSD:**
- André, a 6-year-old, exhibits difficulty articulating various sounds, particularly r, l, and th (among the later-acquired speech sounds)
- Normal intelligence and social development rule out other disorders:
  - Language Disorder
  - Intellectual Disability (Down Syndrome)
  - Autism Spectrum Disorder

**Additional Diagnosis:**
- Frequent letter reversals may raise question for an additional diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With Impairment in Written Expression
- However, some letter reversals are normal at age 6 and this diagnosis is given only if test reveals scores significantly below expected level.

#### 1.4 Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)

**Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)**
* Characterized by persistent disturbances in normal fluency and time patterning of speech for individuals' age and language skills (DSM-5, p. 45)
* Hallmarks: sound and syllable repetitions, prolongations, pauses, circumlocutions, physical tension during speech, monosyllabic whole-word repetition
* Severe enough to interfere with social or academic functioning
* Not caused by speech-motor or sensory deficits or neurological problems
* Commonly referred to as stuttering
* Absent during activities like reading aloud, singing, talking to pets, or inanimate objects (DSM-5, p. 45)
* Onset in childhood, with most cases developing by age 6; majority recover by age 8

**Case Study: "Don't Worry"**
* Parents noticed Aaron's stuttering several months earlier
* Initially rare occurrences became more frequent and caused frustration and anxiety for the child
* Speech therapist suggested maintaining composure during episodes and not completing sentences
* Over time, stuttering gradually resolved, leaving no permanent emotional scars or speech difficulties (DSM-5, p. 45)
* Variable severity from situation to situation, more severe under pressure to communicate.

#### 1.5 Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder

**Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder**
* Defined as "persistent difficulties in the social use of verbal and nonverbal communication" (DSM-5, p. 47)
* New diagnostic label added to describe individuals who have social communication component of Autism Spectrum Disorder but do not meet restricted behavior criterion
* Social communication essential for social participation, development of relationships, academic achievement, occupational performance
* Characteristic deficits: inability to share information appropriately; difficulty changing style of communication to match context or listener needs; trouble following conversation rules (taking turns); understanding idioms, humor, metaphors dependent on context
* Problems interfere with social relationships or academic/occupational functioning
* Not due to neurological conditions or other mental disorders (Intellectual Disability, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Global Developmental Delay)
* Children ages 4-5 should participate in social communication appropriately; onset may not be apparent until early adolescence
* Outcome variable; some improve significantly over time, others persist into adulthood

**Case Study: Clifford's Social Communication Difficulties**
* Age 13, seventh-grade student with delayed language development
* Late talker, received speech therapy from preschool to third grade for delayed use of language and difficulties with sibilant sounds
* Continues to have some verbal communication difficulties: talks loudly despite reminders; talks over others in small groups; pedantic when excited about topics; difficulty following conversations
* Favorite subjects are math and computer-related things; interests limit social interactions with peers
* Has few close friends, considers online contacts as friends; difficult reading body language or nonverbal cues
* Insensitive to feelings of peers, repeats hurtful behaviors without understanding impact
* Persistent difficulties in the social use of verbal and nonverbal communication interfere with peer group interactions and cause impairment in social functioning.

**Social Gaffes Behavior**
* Difficulty communicating with friends in conversation; talks over them about irrelevant topics
* Inability to modulate conversational tone (talks loudly, pedantically)
* Talks on and on without regard for others in the conversation
* Hurtful words or actions due to lack of understanding social cues and body language
* Poor at interpreting jokes that depend on context.

### AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER
#### 1.6 Autism Spectrum Disorder

**Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**
* New diagnosis in DSM-5, characterized by:
  + Persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts
  + Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities
* Subsumes most cases of DSM-IV Autistic Disorder, Asperger’s Disorder, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDNOS)

**Social Communication Deficits:**
1. **Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity**: Limited back-and-forth conversation or sharing of interests and feelings
2. **Deficits in nonverbal communication**: Poor eye contact, lack of facial expression, misunderstanding or use of gestures
3. **Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships**: Difficulties adjusting behavior to social context, poor peer relations, lack of interest in peers

**Restricted Patterns:**
1. Stereotyped motor movements, objects, or speech (e.g., lining up toys, flipping objects, echoing)
2. Ineflexible adherence to daily routines
3. Pathological resistance to change (distress at small changes)
4. Ritualized behaviors (repetitive questioning, pacing)
5. Highly restricted and fixated interests (e.g., strong attachment to objects, preoccupation with vacuums)
6. Abnormal responses to sensory input: extreme reactions to sounds or textures, excessive smelling/touching, fascination with lights or spinning objects, indifference to pain, heat, or cold
7. Savant abilities in areas like art, music, calendar calculation, math, and spatial skills (fewer than 10% of individuals have such abilities)

**Diagnosis and Severity:**
- Signs typically become evident between ages 12-24 months but may not fully manifest until social demands exceed child’s capacities
- Social, occupational functioning adversely affected
- Severity level based on deficits in social communication and restricted behaviors:
  * Level 1: Requiring support
  * Level 2: Requiring substantial support
  * Level 3: Requiring very substantial support

**Variability:**
- With or Without Accompanying Intellectual Impairment
- With or Without Accompanying Language Impairment
- Associated With a Known Medical or Genetic Condition or Environmental Factor
- Associated With Another Neurodevelopmental, Mental, or Behavioral Disorder

**Prevalence:**
- Estimated at 1% worldwide
- Rates have risen due to expanded definitions, increased awareness, true increase in incidence, or a combination of factors
- Diagnosed four times more often in boys than girls; girls may go unrecognized if without Intellectual Disability
- Course is usually toward improvement over time, but only a minority live and work independently.

##### Echo

**Reed's Developmental Delay and Abnormal Behavior**

**Background:**
- Firstborn child
- Difficult delivery, needed oxygen at birth
- Lack of response to social contact and baby games from infancy

##### The Roman

**Ronald's Case Study**

**Background:**
- Roman, a 19-year-old man from London
- Youngest of four children with older siblings who were intelligent and well-adjusted
- Difficult birth and episodes of cyanosis in first 48 hours
- Delayed motor and language development but not enough to warrant concern at the time
- Quiet, self-contained baby and child, never initiated play but did as told
- No apparent problems, but lacked imaginative pretend play

**Developmental Milestones:**
- Poorly coordinated in gross motor movements (rolling over, sitting up)
- Slow learner in dressing himself and performing other motor tasks
- Spoke very little but responded to questioning with grammatical speech
- Odd vocal intonation, spaced rises and falls in speech, avoided eye contact

**Behavioral Patterns:**
- Walked the same school route daily, insisted on sitting in same seat
- Organized desk and books precisely
- Coped with schoolwork due to good rote memory and reading skills
- Poor at arithmetic, did less well in all subjects as abstract ideas were demanded
- Naive and immature, protected from bullying by older siblings
- No real friends outside family

**Interests:**
- Learned to read before school age through TV commercials
- Began reading about ancient Romans and archaeological remains at around 7 years old
- Amassed prodigious knowledge on ancient Rome but lacked deeper understanding of historical context
- Spent all spare time pursuing Roman interests, alienating some peers

**Diagnosis:**
- Autism Spectrum Disorder based on long history of odd social behaviors since early childhood
- Social communication skills impairment at mildest level (requiring support)
- Restricted patterns of interests and activities, suggesting diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder

**Additional Information:**
- Diagnosis encompassed by DSM-5's Autism Spectrum Disorder instead of separate Asperger’s Syndrome diagnosis in prior edition.

##### Rocking and Reading

**Betsy's Case**

**Background**:
- Betsy, 22 years old, referred for evaluation after "not fitting in" at group home
- Placed in residential treatment at age 4, remained there since
- Parents both deceased, no contact with sibling
- Reported to have several abnormal electroencephalograms but no seizures or medical problems
- IQ of 55, comparable deficits in adaptive behaviors

**Evaluation Findings**:
- Spent time reading children's book, monotonic voice, unable to respond to questions about it
- Repeated single phrase "Blum, blum" in a monotonic voice
- Continuous rocking during interview, made eye contact initially but otherwise oblivious of surroundings
- No initiation of activities, lack of response to examiner's attempts to interest her
- Self-abusive behavior: repeated pounding of legs, biting hand
- Physical examination revealed extensive bruises on lower extremities

**Early Childhood History**:
- Delayed motor milestones, concerns about hearing
- Unusual ability to memorize and fascination with reading despite lack of comprehension
- Repetitive stereotyped behaviors: body rocking, head banging
- Lack of attachments to parents, idiosyncratic responses to sounds
- Extreme upset when there were changes in environment

**Diagnosis**:
- Autism Spectrum Disorder (DSM-5): impairment in social interaction, abnormal speech, repetitive stereotyped behaviors, restricted range of interests
- Stereotypic Movement Disorder: self-injurious behavior, severe enough to be a focus of treatment
- Intellectual Disability (DSM-5): accompanying limitation to independent function
- Previous diagnosis of Childhood Schizophrenosis not relevant due to lack of continuity with adult psychosis.

##### Reggie’s Regression

**Reggie's Case**

**Reggie's Background**:
- Born to professional parents
- Normally sociable baby, developed normally up to age 3
- Enrolled in nursery school and toilet trained at that time
- Parents had videotapes showing normal development

**Regression**:
- Around the birth of a sibling, Reggie became anxious and agitated
- Over several weeks, his behavior regressed markedly in:
  - Toilet training
  - Age-appropriate self-care activities
  - Social skills
  - Spending hours rocking back and forth
- By age 4, Reggie was functioning at a 1-year level in cognitive and communicative abilities
- Exhibited behavioral features suggestive of autism (lack of social responsivity, difficulties with transitions, stereotyped movements)

**Evaluation Findings**:
- No specific medical condition identified from extensive medical evaluations
- Reggie was enrolled in a special education program with full-time aide and educational supports by age 6
- Despite the supports, Reggie made few developmental gains and remained almost entirely mute

**Discussion**:
- Reggie's case is characterized by severe impairment in language and social reciprocity, and presence of stereotyped behavior
- This suggests a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (DSM-5)
- Regression after age 3 is very rare in autism, although loss of skills can occur between ages 12 and 24 months
- The prognosis for such cases of regression is worse compared to early onset autism
- Parents' reports of a psychosocial event (e.g., sibling birth) may be chance associations reflecting common life changes in preschool children.

  - Onset of full-blown psychotic symptoms within 1 month of behavior change
  - Confusion or perplexity at the height of psychotic episode
  - Good functioning before onset of psychosis

**Case Study: Late Bloomer (Jeanette Fielding)**
- 35-year-old single, college-educated black woman
- Escorted to emergency room after sister's concern about erratic work patterns
- Only prior psychiatric contact was brief therapy in college

##### Postpartum Piety

**Case Study: Mrs. Zela Akerele's Postpartum Psychosis**

**Background:**

13. Suicidal ideation (implied)

**Diagnosis:**
- Postpartum psychosis or Schizophreniform Disorder
  - DSM-5 does not offer a specific postpartum psychosis diagnosis
  - Mrs. Akerele's symptoms do not fit neatly into Manic Episode, Major Depressive Episode, Brief Psychotic Disorder, or any other DSM-5 diagnostic category

**Treatment:**
1. Antipsychotic medication: chlorpromazine
2. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) - six treatments
3. Traditional healing and spiritual church healers in Nigeria

**Prevalence and Considerations:**
- Postpartum psychosis prevalence is 0.1%-0.2% of the population
- One of the rarer psychiatric disorders but considered a psychiatric emergency due to rapid onset and potential for severe outcomes
- DSM-5 includes the specifier "With Peripartum Onset" that can be applied to various diagnoses if symptoms develop during pregnancy or within 4 weeks postpartum
- ECT is an effective treatment for postpartum psychosis, although traditional healing methods are often preferred in Nigeria.

### 2.3 Schizoaffective Disorder

- Hybrid of Schizophrenia/Schizophreniform Disorder and Mood Disorder (Bipolar or Major Depressive)

**Characteristics**:
- Overlapping psychotic and mood symptoms: delusions, hallucinations, mania, depression
- Two types based on pattern of mood symptoms: Bipolar Type or Depressive Type

**Differentiation from Other Disorders**:
- Schizophrenia: less time with mood symptoms present (minority of illness duration)
- Psychotic Mood Disorders: psychotic symptoms occur only during mood episodes

**Treatment and Prognosis**:
- Treatment: mood-stabilizing medications for Bipolar Type, antidepressants for Depressive Type, antipsychotics for psychotic symptoms
- Long-term prognosis: better than Schizophrenia but worse than psychotic Mood Disorders

**Case Study: Foster Mother Sophie Baumann**

**Background**:
- 44-year-old mother of three teenagers, separated from husband for 10 years
- Shy, emotional constricted person with no history of illness before last year

### 2.4 Delusional Disorder

**Delusional Disorder**
* Persistent psychotic disorder with primary symptom being one or more delusions lasting at least 1 month
* Absence of other psychotic symptoms like hallucinations, disorganized thinking or behavior (Schizophrenia)
* No obvious signs of mental illness apart from impact on functioning
* Examples: belief in secret government surveillance, jealousy, erotomania, somatic sensations, grandiosity
* DSM-5 provides various subtypes based on predominant theme of delusional belief: Persecutory, Jealous, Erotomanic, Somatic, Grandiose, Unspecified
* Rare disorder with an estimated prevalence of 0.2%
* Most common form is the Persecutory Type
* No major gender differences in overall frequency
* Can start from adolescence but typically begins in middle to late adulthood
* Sudden onset
* Long-term outcome varies, up to half of patients may experience lasting remission.

- Incorporation of additional individuals into paranoid belief system

**Atypical Aspects:**
- Reluctance to seek help is not typical for Persecutory Type Delusional Disorder

##### Three Voices

**Haruki Takahashi's Case Study**

**Background:**
- 23-year-old man admitted to hospital due to profunda loss of energy and mute behavior
- Lived in Flushing, Queens, New York for several years after breaking up with girlfriend
- Worked odd jobs but unable to pursue long-term goals
- Went to California to change environment and find new job, but became frightened and paranoid
- Diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and psychotic features by psychiatrist

**Symptoms:**
- Profunda loss of energy
- Little appetite
- Virtually no interest or pleasure in activities
- Heard three distinct voices: a child's voice, woman's voice, man impersonating woman

- Discharged home on nortriptyline 150 mg/day but no other psychotropic medication
- Symptoms reappeared rapidly when he ran out of nortriptyline treatment
- Good response to antidepressant and family history of mood disorder

**Discussion:**
- Haruki's case raises questions about appropriate subclassification of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) during recurrent episodes
- DSM-5 considers a 2-month period with no or only mild symptoms as minimal amount of time for considering a new episode
- Some clinicians might regard the rapid development of symptoms following discontinuation of medication as indicating continuation of original MDD episode.

##### It’s Typical?

**Ms. Siegel's Case**

- Avoidance of places/situations reminding her of the event (going out after dark)
- Negative changes in cognitions and mood: withdrawal from friends, feelings of guilt and self-blame
- Alterations in arousal: exaggerated startle response, trouble concentrating, sleep disturbance
- **Mild dissociative experiences**: daydreaming, forgetting what she intended to buy

**Diagnosis Discussion**:
- Likely case of **PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder)** (DSM-5)
- Symptoms began after a short latency period, but not delayed expression
- If only mild and nonspecific anxiety symptoms: **Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety**

##### The Wreck

**The Wreck: Case Study of Enrique Casales**

**Background:**
- 40-year-old married carpenter, Mr. Casales
- Motor vehicle accident 2 years ago with no head trauma or loss of consciousness
- Hospitalized for neck strain and inflammation of spinal nerve to trapezius muscle in back
- Diagnosis: neck strain and inflammation
- Treatment: physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medication

**Symptoms After the Accident:**
- Occasional involuntary thoughts of the accident
- Trouble falling asleep, irritability, anxious mood, impaired concentration, increased appetite, weight gain
- Symptoms waxed and waned over months
- No avoidance behavior or loss of interest in usual activities (including sexual interest)
- Continued socializing with friends
- Transient anxiety when driving past accident site
- Orthopedic injuries prevented return to work as a carpenter, but he continued working at "side businesses"
- Marital life deteriorated due to irritability
- Able to enjoy himself on camping trips

**Surgery and Postsurgery Symptoms:**
- Decided to undergo recommended surgery for temporary disability in right shoulder and arm
- Developed more dramatic symptoms:
  - Unable to sleep due to terrifying dreams, unable to return to sleep for hours
  - Loss of interest in sex
  - Exaggerated startle response to loud noises (e.g., honking horns, slamming doors)
  - Acute anxiety when a passenger in a car, nausea, outbursts of anger while driving or passing an accident site
  - Unable to concentrate on side businesses
  - Marital situation deteriorated due to emotional isolation from wife and planned divorce

**Diagnosis:**
- After 6 weeks of symptoms, sought assistance from orthopedic surgeon who made a psychiatric referral
- Treated with antidepressant (sertraline) and supportive psychotherapy, which promptly controlled the symptoms
- Postsurgery disability resolved after 2 months, allowing full range of motion and nearly full strength
- Attempts to reduce dosage of sertraline resulted in return of dreams, sleep disturbances, and high level of anxiety.

**Conclusion:**
- In the months following the accident, Mr. Casales exhibited nonspecific anxiety symptoms that could have been diagnosed as Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety.
- The full clinical picture of PTSD (with delayed expression) developed about 2 years later after undergoing surgery for injuries related to the accident.

##### Flashbacks

**Michael Bennett's Case:**
* Admitted to hospital in 1975, age 23, after experiencing depression, insomnia, and flashbacks related to his Vietnam War experiences
* Honorably discharged two years prior with minimal difficulties adjusting to civilian life
* Wife noticed reluctance to discuss military experiences but wrote it off as normal reactions
* Symptoms began around the time of Saigon's fall in 1975
* Preoccupation with war news and avoidance due to distress
* Flashbacks: nightmares, dissociative experiences, increased arousal, persistent negative emotions
* Avoided all sources of war news
* Symptoms indicate PTSD (DSM-5): intrusion symptoms, persistent negative emotions, avoidance behavior, and symptoms with delayed expression.

**Michael Bennett's Diagnosis:**
* PTSD diagnosis based on DSM-5 criteria: intrusive memories, persistent negative emotions, avoidance behavior, and symptoms with delayed expression.
* Symptoms of guilt for surviving when others did not (survivor guilt).

**Impact of Trauma:**
* Increased risk for chronic health issues such as cardiovascular diseases, nervous system disorders, musculoskeletal disorders.
* Higher mortality rate: Vietnam War veterans with PTSD are twice as likely to die over a 25-year period compared to those without PTSD.
* Recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have produced approximately 270,000 veterans diagnosed with PTSD, half of whom receive disability benefits.
* Prolonged deployments may contribute to these issues.

### 7.4 Acute Stress Disorder

**Acute Stress Disorder (ASD)**
* Similar manifestations to PTSD but duration lasts from 3 days to 1 month after exposure to trauma
* Characteristics of stressor: exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence (DSM-5, p. 280)
* Symptoms:
	- Any 9 out of 14 symptoms regardless of category
	- Fewer than 20% of people exposed to traumatic events develop ASD
	- Higher prevalence among women
	- May progress to PTSD (approximately half of PTSD cases had Acute Stress Disorder immediately after the stressor)
* Symptoms of Acute Stress Disorder:
	- Distressing memories and recurrent nightmares
	- Negative mood changes, such as no joy about past events or difficulty concentrating on work
	- Dissociative symptoms, like being in a daze or unaware of surroundings
	- Avoidance behavior, refusal to discuss the traumatic event
	- Symptoms of increased arousal, such as sleep disturbances and exaggerated startle response (DSM-5, p. 281)
* Example: Vicky Lawson's case - a woman with a 28% burn injury and her experience after the trauma
	- Fearful and anxious
	- Nightmares and recurring distressing memories
	- Dissociative symptoms (in a daze, unable to remember husband's death)
	- Avoidance behavior (refuses to talk about what happened)
	- Symptoms of increased arousal (sleep disturbances, hypervigilance, and exaggerated startle response)
* Diagnosis: Acute Stress Disorder (DSM-5, p. 280)

**Acute Stress Disorder vs. PTSD**
* ASD requires symptoms to persist for at least 3 days but less than 1 month
* Transient acute symptoms are common following traumatic events and most people recover within a few days or weeks
* DSM-5 uses the diagnosis of Acute Stress Disorder when PTSD-like symptoms interfere with social or occupational functioning (DSM-5, p. 280)

- **Example: Karen Davidoff's case - eyewitness to a murderer's execution**
	- Detached feeling and in a daze after the event
	- Unable to concentrate on work, dissatisfied with it
	- Difficulty sleeping, nightmares of the execution
	- Reexperiences trauma through intrusive recollections, flashbacks (vivid "snapshot" images), negative mood state, and dissociative symptoms.
* Diagnosis: PTSD (not met criteria for ASD as symptoms persisted beyond a month) (DSM-5, p. 273)

### 7.5 Adjustment Disorders

**Adjustment Disorders**

**Definition**: Distressing emotional or behavioral reaction to a stressful life event that causes significant distress or interferes with social or occupational functioning.

**Types of Stressors**:
- Single event (e.g., breakup of a relationship)

* Abused children may abuse their own children
* The level of abuse identified in this case is not as severe as some other cases where multigenerational abuse has been identified.

## CHAPTER 8 Dissociative Disorders

**Dissociative Disorders**
* Dissociation: mental process disrupting connection between conscious awareness and aspects of self (memory, identity, perception)
* On a continuum of severity
* Mild dissociation: daydreaming, getting lost in a book, altered states from drug use
* Problematic dissociation: 3 specific DSM-5 disorders present

**Characteristics of Dissociative Disorders**

**Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)**
- Disruption of identity
- Two or more distinct personality states
- Recurrent gaps in recall of everyday events

**Dissociative Amnesia**
- Inability to recall important autobiographical information, usually traumatic or stressful

**Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder**
- Persistent or recurrent experiences of:
  - Depersonalization (unreality or detachment from self)
  - Derealization (unreality or detachment from surroundings)

**Additional Considerations**
- Dissociative symptoms not necessarily indicative of a Dissociative Disorder
- Can occur in other disorders: Panic Attack, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
- May not indicate any disorder at all.

### 8.1 Dissociative Identity Disorder

**Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)**

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple distinct personality states, or "alters"
- Each alter has unique traits, history, thought processes, and ways of relating to surroundings
- Some alters may be of different genders with distinct names and mannerisms
- Stress or trauma triggers switch between alters
- Symptoms include amnesia, time loss, unfamiliar people claiming to know the person, and missing items

**Causes:**
- Severe childhood trauma, often involving extreme physical, sexual, or emotional abuse
- Dissociative coping mechanism for dealing with unassimilable trauma

**Controversy:**
- Some argue it is underdiagnosed due to the shifting nature of symptoms
- Others claim diagnoses are based on suggestion from therapists or famous cases like "The Three Faces of Eve" or "Sybil"

**Case Study: Mary Kendall (Mary Quite Contrary)**
- 35-year-old social worker referred for treatment of reflex sympathetic dystrophy
- Highly hypnotizable and used self-hypnosis to control pain
- Competent at work but had a lackluster personal life
- Strange occurrences: unexplained car gas tank drops, memory gaps, nighttime driving without recall
- Psychiatric evaluation revealed dissociative disorder and six additional personality states
- Personality states organized along dependent-aggressive continuum, tension between them
- Memories of physical/sexual abuse by father and others, guilt about not protecting siblings
- Four years of psychotherapy resulted in partial integration of personality states.

### 8.2 Dissociative Amnesia

**Dissociative Amnesia:**

**Definition**: Unconscious blocking out of important personal information, often related to a stressful or traumatic event like child abuse or combat.

**Types**:
- Situation-specific: Memory loss for particular incidents
- Global: Complete gap in memory lasting months to years
- Localized amnesia: Failure to recall events during circumscribed period of time
  * Selective: Remembering some parts but not others
  * Generalized: Complete loss of memory for life history and personal identity

**Characteristics**:
- Memories still exist but deeply buried
- Can resurface on their own or after being triggered
- Some episodes resolve rapidly, while others persist for long periods
- High prevalence of suicidal and self-destructive behaviors

**Statistics**: 1.8% 12-month prevalence among adults in the U.S., more common in females than males, can occur at any age group.

- **Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions**: Psychological or behavioral factors adversely affecting a medical condition, additional health risks, influencing underlying pathophysiology
- **Factitious Disorder**: Falsification of physical or psychological signs/symptoms, induction of injury or disease, treated by mental health professional rather than non-psychiatric medical clinic

**Diagnostic Shift in DSM-5**:
- Diagnosis based on presence of somatic symptoms and level of distress/impairment, rather than unexplained medical symptoms
- Patients often rejected psychological origin of physical symptoms, preferring medical treatment
- Limited ability of mental health clinician to determine medically unexplained symptoms

### 9.1 Somatic Symptom Disorder

**Somatic Symptom Disorder**

**Definition:**
- Distress or disruption of life due to physical symptoms
- Multiple current somatic symptoms lasting at least 6 months
- Can be specific or nonspecific, sometimes only one severe symptom (e.g., pain)

##### No Parking

**Vanessa Abernathy's Case:**
* **Background**: Vanessa Abernathy, a 36-year-old traffic enforcement agent, was referred for psychiatric examination by her lawyer after an incident 10 months prior.
* **Incident Details**: She wrote a ticket and placed it on an illegally parked car; a man swore at and attacked her, knocking her down with enough force to fracture her jaw. She was hospitalized and diagnosed with a hairline fracture, but recovered after a month.
* **Physical Symptoms**: Post-recovery, she experienced severe pain and muscle tension in her neck and back, becoming virtually immobilized. She spent most of her time sitting or lying down.
* **Behavioral Patterns**: She talked about her pain constantly to family and friends, who grew tired of it. She also hired a lawyer to challenge Workers' Compensation Board's decision to cut off payments and threatened her employer for not returning to work.
* **Diagnosis**: The psychiatrist diagnosed Ms. Abernathy with Somatic Symptom Disorder, With Predominant Pain (DSM-5, p. 311).
* **Malingering vs. Somatic Symptom Disorder**: The question was raised if her pain symptoms were being fabricated or exaggerated to avoid work and receive financial compensation. However, her genuine suffering and desire to return to work made this unlikely.

### 9.2 Illness Anxiety Disorder

**Illness Anxiety Disorder (IAD)**
* Individuals excessively focus on physical health and fear of developing serious diseases
* Preoccupation impairs social and occupational functioning or causes significant distress
* Symptoms may include normal physiological sensations, benign dysfunctions, or self-examination

* Preoccupied with various symptoms, including abdominal sensations, fearing they indicate colon cancer or other serious conditions
* Engages in self-diagnostic behaviors such as X-ray studies and stool tests
* Spends significant time researching illnesses online
* Strain on marriage due to time spent on health concerns

**Diagnosis:**
* Mr. Davies exhibits symptoms of Illness Anxiety Disorder (IAD) rather than Somatic Symptom Disorder, as his focus is on the implications of symptoms rather than the discomfort itself.

### 9.4 Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions

**Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (DSM-5)**

**Condition Definition:**
- Diagnosed when psychological or behavioral factors adversely impact existing medical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus or heart disease, or symptoms like pain
- Influence can be demonstrated through various means:
  - Close temporal association between psychological factors and development/exacerbation of medical condition
  - Interference with treatment, e.g., denial of significance or severity leading to poor adherence
  - Established health risks, such as chronic occupational stress increasing risk for hypertension

- False reporting of symptoms (e.g., seizures, dizziness)
- Alteration of laboratory tests (e.g., adding blood to urine)
- Falsification of medical records
- Self-inflicted injuries or induction of illness in others

**Diagnosis:**
- Demonstrated misrepresentation, simulation, or causing signs/symptoms of illness
- No obvious external rewards for appearing sick (e.g., insurance money, disability)
- Not considered a mental disorder in DSM-5 but can be recorded as focus of clinical attention (Malingering)

**Statistics:**
- Difficult to obtain accurate statistics due to dishonesty and multiple treatments at different facilities
- Estimated that about 1% of hospitalized individuals may have Factitious Disorder.

## CHAPTER 10 Feeding and Eating Disorders

**Feeding and Eating Disorders (DSM-5)**

**Overview**:
- Eating disturbances may indicate various mental disorders, but not necessarily Feeding and Eating Disorders
- DSM-5 chapter on "Feeding and Eating Disorders": persistent disturbances in eating behavior impairing physical health or psychosocial functioning

**Types of Feeding and Eating Disorders**:
1. **Pica**: Eating nonnutritive, nonfood substances

**Definition:**
- Persistent eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances (DSM-5, p. 330)
- Examples: paper, soap, cloth, hair, etc.
- Does not apply if infant accidentally ingests something
- Can lead to medical emergencies and nutritional deficiencies

**Characteristics:**
- May be associated with another mental disorder or pregnancy cravings
- Serious disorder for potential risks

**Case Study: "Omnivorous George"**
- 5-year-old admitted for nutritional anemia due to ingestion of nonnutritive substances (paint, plaster, etc.)
- History of numerous hospitalizations since age 19 months (lighter fluid)
- Parents described as immature and dependent, low socioeconomic status
- Mother ate dirt during pregnancy
- Father periodically abused drugs and alcohol

**Additional Information:**
- May be developmentally appropriate for infants, but persistent behavior warrants diagnosis of Pica (DSM-5, p. 329)
- In some cultural settings, eating nonnutritive substances may be sanctioned practice, but not in all cases.

### 10.2 Rumination Disorder

**Rumination Disorder**

**Characteristics**:
- Repeated regurgitation of food after feeding or eating
- Regurgitated food may be partially digested and re-chewed, re-swallowed, or spit out
- Not caused by gastrointestinal conditions like gastroesophageal reflux or pyloric stenosis

**Associated Conditions**:
- Anorexia Nervosa: individuals may regurgitate and spit out food to control weight gain
- Bulimia Nervosa: individuals may regurgitate food as a means of getting rid of ingested calories

**Diagnosis**:
- If rumination is a symptom of another mental disorder, Rumination Disorder is not diagnosed
- If rumination requires special clinical attention, a diagnosis can be made even if associated with another mental disorder

**Occurrence**:
- Can occur in infancy, childhood, adolescence, or adulthood
- Most common among infants between ages 3 and 12 months

**Consequences**:
- Can lead to malnutrition, growth delay, developmental and learning problems, and even be fatal in infants

**Case Study: "Baby Olivia"**
- 6-month-old infant with failure to gain weight and regurgitation after every feeding
- Parents making a marginal marital adjustment and often talking about separation or divorce
- Lack of evidence of inappropriate social relatedness rules out Reactive Attachment Disorder
- Regurgitation is the cause of weight loss, indicating Rumination Disorder

### 10.3 Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder

**Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)**

**Characteristics**:
- Persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or energy needs
- Lack of interest in eating or food
- Food avoidance based on extreme sensitivity to sensory characteristics of food
- Concern about negative consequences of eating, such as choking or vomiting
- Results in weight loss or failure to gain weight (in children)
- Nutritional deficiency
- Need for food supplements
- Impairment in psychosocial functioning

**Diagnosis**:
- DSM-5 diagnosis: 334.10
- Occurs most frequently in infancy and early childhood (failure to thrive)
- Expanded to include food avoidance or restriction at any age
- Not related to Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, or a concurrent medical condition
- May occur with other mental disorders: Anxiety Disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
- Diagnosed in addition to the other disorder if food avoidance is severe or requires special clinical attention
- Not warranted if gastrointestinal problems cause food avoidance (gastroesophageal reflux)

**Case Study: Roberto**
- 6-month-old admitted for failure to gain weight, below the 15th percentile
- Colic symptoms: recurrent episodes of prolonged crying and irritability
- Poor synchrony between mother and baby during feeding
- Disinterested in feeding, distressing experience for both mother and child
- No specific medical condition accounting for difficulties

**Maternal Depression and Marital Problems**:
- Contributed to mother's difficulties in feeding Roberto
- Treatment of depression and underlying marital problems facilitated the mother's adjustment
- Gradual diminishment of Roberto's feeding difficulties
- Within a few weeks, he gained several pounds.

##### Picky Eater

- Has not started menstruating
- Tall and lanky, no concerns about appearance
- Early feeding concerns: refused formula as a baby, only ate slightly larger variety of foods at young age

**Diagnosis**:
- **ARFID (Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder)**: Significant weight loss or failure to gain expected weight due to food restriction and sensory characteristics/aversive consequences of eating.

**Treatment**:
- Evidence-based treatments for Eating and Anxiety Disorders
- Combination of medication (SSRI) and CBT for moderate to severe anxiety
- Goals: increase ability to eat in different settings, expand food variety, implement parent management strategies for increasing food intake.

**Additional Considerations**:
- **Anorexia Nervosa**: Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, not applicable as Nicole doesn't have concerns about her appearance
- **Social Anxiety Disorder**: Embarrassment in situations beyond eating behavior, some social anxiety present but not captured by embarrassment over eating.

### 10.4 Anorexia Nervosa

**Anorexia Nervosa**

**Symptoms**:
- Fear of gaining weight or becoming fat often persists or increases as weight is lost
- Denial of fear of becoming fat but engaging in behaviors to interfere with weight maintenance
- Focus on specific body parts that are perceived as "fat"
- Weight loss perceived as a sign of self-control, weight gain seen as failure
- Lack of recognition of medical seriousness of condition

**Prevalence**:
- 12-month prevalence in young females: approximately 0.4%
- 10 times more common in females than males
- Usually begins during adolescence or young adulthood
- Extremely serious and life-threatening condition due to malnutrition impacting major organ systems

**Treatment**:
- Expert treatment is necessary for a good outcome
- Diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder if obsessions and compulsions are not related to food, body shape, or weight.

**Case Study: Peggy Sims**
- 20-year-old woman with a weight of only 67 pounds
- Began losing weight 4 years earlier, initially for weight loss and later through dieting and excessive exercise
- Lost over 80% of her normal weight, leading to complications like peptic ulcer disease and amenorrhea
- Recovered with inpatient treatment, including psychotherapy and weight gain strategies.

##### Close to the Bone

**Anorexia Nervosa Case Study: Ms. Duval's Story**

**Background:**
- 23-year-old woman from Arkansas
- College student who used extreme measures to lose weight, including laxatives and self-induced vomiting
- Described as underweight, weighing around 90 pounds at her lowest point
- Suffered from distorted body image, fear of gaining weight, and binge eating followed by purging

**Symptoms:**
- Used laxatives for two years, eventually increasing dosage to 250-300 pills at a time
- Experienced severe dehydration, gastrointestinal issues, and ulcer
- Forced vomiting after eating small amounts of food
- Maintained extremely low weight through rigorous exercise routine and restrictive diet
- Fearful of gaining even a few pounds, avoiding water intake and certain foods

**Diagnosis:**
- Anorexia Nervosa, Binge Eating/Purging Type (DSM-5)

**History:**
- Started using laxatives in college to lose weight
- Gradually increased dosage over time
- Developed extreme fear of gaining weight and distorted body image
- Lost nearly 50 pounds in a few months, reaching a low point of 90 pounds

- Received psychoanalytically-oriented psychotherapy twice a week for approximately 6 months
- Attended nutritionist sessions to learn about healthy diets and maintain normal weight
- Continued to experience intermittent binge eating, vomiting, and diuretic abuse but with reduced frequency and severity

**Significance:**
- Anorexia Nervosa is a long-standing disorder with irrational fear of becoming obese despite being underweight
- Ms. Duval's case illustrates the binge eating/purging type of anorexia nervosa, which involves periodic binges followed by compensatory purging behaviors to lose weight
- Anorexia Nervosa can lead to various complications such as malnutrition, osteoporosis, cardiac issues, and mental health disorders if left untreated.

## CHAPIER 12 Sleep-Wake Disorders

**Sleep-Wake Disorders**

**Introduction**:
- Most individuals experience sleep problems at some point due to stress or external factors
- When sleep problems persist and interfere with daily functioning, a DSM-5 Sleep-Wake Disorder may be appropriate
- Individuals present with complaints about the quality, timing, and amount of their sleep, resulting in daytime distress and impairment

**Sleep Stages**:
- There are five distinct stages of sleep:
  1. **Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep**
  2. Four stages of **Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) Sleep**:
     - Stage 1 NREM sleep
     - Stage 2 NREM sleep
     - Stages 3 and 4 NREM sleep
- REM sleep occurs cyclically throughout the night, alternating with NREM sleep every 80-100 minutes
- REM sleep increases in duration toward the morning

**Measurement of Sleep Stages**:
- Polygraphy: measures brain waves, blood oxygen level, heart rate, breathing, and eye/leg movements during sleep
- Used to diagnose certain DSM-5 Sleep-Wake Disorders (e.g., REM Sleep Behavior Disorder)

**DSM-5 Sleep-Wake Disorders**:
- **Insomnia Disorder**: dissatisfaction with sleep quality or quantity, difficulty initiating/maintaining sleep, early-morning awakening
- **Hypersomnolence Disorder**: excessive daytime sleepiness, unrefreshing prolonged main sleep episodes, difficulty being awake after abrupt awakening
- **Narcolepsy**: recurrent periods of an irrepressible need to sleep, lapsing into sleep, or napping during the same day
   - Includes **Cataplexy**: bilateral loss of muscle tone
   - Includes **Abnormal laboratory testing** (e.g., REM sleep intrusion into non-REM sleep)
- **Obstructive Sleep Apnea**: laboratory evidence of at least 5 obstructive apneas/hypopneas per hour of sleep, daytime fatigue
- **Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders**: problem with the timing of sleep due to alteration or misalignment between circadian rhythm and sleep-wake schedule
- **Parasomnias**: abnormal movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, or dreams during sleep (e.g., sleepwalking, nightmares, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder)
- **Restless Legs Syndrome**: urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations in the legs, primarily at night
- **Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder**: persistent and severe sleep disturbance due to direct effects of substances or medications on the central nervous system

**Other Sleep Disorders**:
- **Narcolepsy**: a neurological condition involving the loss of the brain's ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally
- **Breathing-Related Sleep Disorders**: sleep disruption caused by abnormal breathing during sleep (e.g., Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea, Central Sleep Apnea, Sleep-Related Hyperpnea)
  - These must be ruled out when a person presents with excessive daytime sleepiness

### 12.9 Restless Legs Syndrome

**Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)**
* Neurological disorder characterized by:
  * Throbbing, pulling, creeping, or unpleasant sensations in the legs
  * Uncontrollable urge to move them
* Symptoms occur primarily at night during relaxation or rest
* Affects both legs but can involve other parts of the body (arms, torso, head, phantom limbs)
* Relieved by movement, which temporarily alleviates discomfort
* Prevalence rates vary from 2% to 7.2%, depending on criteria used (DSM-5)
* Affects both men and women, but more common in women with a twice-as-high incidence rate
* Can begin at any age, with symptoms becoming more frequent and lasting longer with age
* Up to 90% of people with RLS also experience periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS)

**Case Study: Mrs. Bianchi**
* Referred for depression and anxiety treatment
* Initially prescribed escitalopram and diphenhydramine
* Suffered from insomnia, worsening after taking escitalopram
* Unable to fall asleep due to irresistible urge to pace and uncomfortable sensations in her legs (RLS)
* Symptoms described as "bugs crawling"
* Urgency starts in the late evening, worsens during rest or inactivity, and subsides with movement
* Diurnal pattern, more focused on legs than other parts of the body
* Exacerbated by alcohol consumption
* Gabapentin treatment effectively subsidized symptoms
* RLS diagnosis confirmed based on DSM-5 criteria: urge to move starts in the late evening, relief from movement, occurs at least three times a week for 3 months, distress or impairment in functioning, not attributable to another mental disorder or medical condition, or drug abuse or medication.

### 12.10 Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder 

**Symptoms:**
- Insomnia: difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep, frequent awakenings during the night, nonrestorative sleep
- Daytime sleepiness: excessive sleepiness or fatigue during daytime hours
- Parasomnia: abnormal behavior occurring during sleep (e.g., nightmares)

**Diagnosis:**
- Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder is diagnosed when an individual has a prominent sleep disturbance that is the direct physiological effect of a medication or drug of abuse

**Causes:**
- Intoxication or withdrawal from: alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, opioids, sedatives/hypnotics/anxiolytics, stimulants (including cocaine)
- Withdrawal from tobacco
- Medications: adrenergic agonists and antagonists, dopamine agonists and antagonists, cholinergic agonists and antagonists, serotonergic agonists and antagonists, antihistamines, corticosteroids

**Case Study: Ms. Lazarus**

## CHAPTER 13 Sexual Dysfunctions

**Sexual Dysfunctions (DSM-5)**
* **Description**: Group of disorders characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in sexual response or pleasure
* **Phases and Disorders**
	- **Desire Phase**: Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder
		- Lack of erotic thoughts, fantasies, and desire for sex
	- **Excitement Phase**: Erectile Dysfunction (Male)
		- Failure to obtain or maintain erections during sex
	- **Orgasm Phase**: Female Sexual Interest / Arousal Disorder, Premature (Early) Ejaculation (Male), Delayed Ejaculation (Male), Female Orgasmic Disorder

* **Resolution Phase**: No dysfunction associated
* **Other Sexual Dysfunctions**
	- Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder
		- Difficulties with vaginal penetration during intercourse, pelvic pain
	- Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction
		- Direct effects on central nervous system functions
* **Diagnosis Considerations**

	- Cultural and religious factors, age
	- Persistence of symptoms for at least 6 months
	- Distress caused by the dysfunction
* **Subtypes and Contexts**
	- Lifetime or acquired
	- Situational or generalized

### 13.1 Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder

**Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD)**

**Characteristics**:
- Dysfunction in the first phase of sexual response cycle: reduction or absence of erotic thoughts, fantasies, and desire for sexual activity
- Men may not initiate or respond to partner's desire for sexual activity
- Less troubled by condition than partners who miss out on physical affection, touch, and opportunities for procreation
- May be specific to a partner or not limited to any potential partner
- Approximately 20% of men are affected (DSM-5)
- More common in older men: 40% among ages 65+ vs. 6% among younger men (DSM-5)

**Case Study: Jim Benson**
- Lifelong history of minimal interest in sex
- Infrequent masturbation, no masturbatory fantasies, and normal endocrinological workup
- First sexual experience at high school due to group pressure
- College years focused on studies with limited dating
- Married at age 28, wife initially impressed by his gentlemanly behavior
- Sexual desire only initiated by wife, pleasurable but happy with once a year frequency
- Denies sexual fantasies or other sexual preferences
- No evidence of paraphilic interests or homosexual orientation.

**Diagnosis and Discussion**:
- Other causes for low sexual desire need to be considered before making diagnosis: medical conditions, mental disorders, medications, substance abuse, mood disturbances, etc.
- Mr. Benson has normal hormone levels and does not use any medications or drugs of abuse; no evidence of depression or other mental disorders.
- Lifelong nature of his low sexual desire suggests it's not caused by paraphilic interests or homosexual orientation.
- DSM-5 diagnosis: Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD) - Lifelong and Generalized subtypes apply.

### 13.2 Erectile Disorder

**Erectile Dysfunction (ED)**
* Sexual dysfunction affecting men during the excitement phase of sexual activity
* Characterized by difficulty obtaining or maintaining erections:
  * Marked difficulty in obtaining an erection during sex
  * Marked difficulty in maintaining an erection until completion
  * Marked decrease in erectile rigidity
* Diagnosis only given if no specific causes identified and ruled out first
  * Medical causes (e.g., heart disease, diabetes, Parkinson's)
  * Side effects of medications (e.g., diuretics, antidepressants)
  * Substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine)
  * Mental disorders (depression, PTSD)
* Prevalence increases with age, particularly after 50 years old
* Affects approximately 2% of men younger than 40-50 years and up to 40%-50% of men over 60-70 years.

**Case Study: Paul Petersen and Annie**
* Couple contemplating marriage after living together for 10 months
* Annie experiences Paul's persistent inability to maintain erections during intercourse for the past six months
* Paul embarrassed, unsure of cause
* Psychologist diagnoses Erectile Disorder based on symptoms, duration, and absence of other causes.

**Treatment Approach:**
* Sensate focus exercises to improve physical intimacy without pressure to perform sexually.
* Couple's relationship issues not deemed severe enough to preclude diagnosis of Erectile Dysfunction.

### 13.3 Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder

**Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder**

**Diagnosis**:
- DSM-5 diagnosis for dysfunctions involving desire and arousal phases of female sexual response cycle

**Symptoms**:

- Reduced or absent sexual excitement or pleasure during sexual activity
- Reduced or absent sexual interest or arousal in response to written, verbal, or visual cues
- Reduced or absent genital or nongenital sensations during sexual activity

**Causes**:
- Specific medical and substance-induced causes must be ruled out
- Low estrogen levels, especially after menopause, can cause desire and arousal difficulties
- Testosterone is important for female sexual functioning, and low levels are associated with low sexual desire
- Certain medical conditions (diabetes, thyroid disease, cancer) can cause desire or arousal problems
- Reduction in desire and arousal is a common side effect of certain medications (antidepressants, antihypertensives, anticancer drugs)

**Case Study: Mrs. Diaz**
- 45-year-old woman referred for further evaluation and treatment of low sexual desire and arousal
- Experiencing perimenopause with symptoms like hot flashes, menstrual irregularity, and vaginal dryness
- Gradually decreased interest in sex over time, rarely initiating and having difficulty becoming aroused when husband initiates

### 13.4 Premature (Early) Ejaculation

**Premature (Early) Ejaculation**
- DSM-5 includes two disorders involving orgasmic functioning in males: Premature Ejaculation and Delayed Ejaculation
- **Premature Ejaculation**:
  - Defined as "ejaculation occurring during partnered sexual activity within approximately 1 minute following vaginal penetration and before the individual wishes it" (DSM-5, p. 443)
  - May also apply to non-vaginal sexual activities, but specific duration guidelines not established
  - Biological causes include:
    - Excess thyroid hormone
    - Inflammation and infection of the prostate or urethra
    - Nerve damage from surgery or trauma
  - Men with Premature Ejaculation often complain of a sense of lack of control over ejaculation, apprehension about future encounters, decreased self-esteem, and adverse consequences for partner relationships
  - It is one of the most common forms of male sexual dysfunction, with approximately 30% reporting at least one occurrence in the previous year

**Delayed Ejaculation**
- Characterized by a marked delay in or inability to achieve ejaculation despite adequate sexual stimulation
- Usually involves partnered sexual activity
- DSM-5 does not define "delayed", so it is likely when the delay causes distress, frustration, or requires stopping due to fatigue, physical irritation, loss of erection, or partner request
- Men with Delayed Ejaculation may be able to reach orgasm without difficulty during masturbation but have trouble during intercourse
- Prevalence is unknown, but it is the least common male sexual complaint

**Case Studies**
1. **No Control (Premature Ejaculation)**:
   - Liam and Melissa Crane, a successful couple married for 15 years
   - Mr. Crane has a rapid ejaculation problem that threatens their marriage
   - He becomes anxious, moves quickly to intercourse, and ejaculates immediately or within a few strokes, causing wife's dissatisfaction
   - Feels inadequate and guilty, unable to discuss the issue with his wife
   - Diagnosis: Premature Ejaculation (DSM-5, p. 443)
2. **In Jeopardy (Delayed Ejaculation)**:
   - Dennis Collins, a college professor, has never been able to ejaculate during intercourse
   - Able to maintain erections and stimulate partner to orgasm, but unable to reach his own orgasm
   - Attitude is distant and disinterested, describing the problem as if he's an observer
   - Diagnosis: Delayed Ejaculation (DSM-5, p. 424)

### 13.6 Female Orgasmic Disorder

**Female Orgasmic Disorder**

**Characteristics:**
- Difficulty experiencing orgasm or reduced intensity of orgasmic sensations despite adequate sexual stimulation
- Variability in type and intensity of stimulation required for orgasm among women
- Diagnosis should only be considered if problems are experienced on almost all occasions

**Normal Variability:**
- Many women require clitoral stimulation to reach orgasm, not during intercourse
- Physiological factors like medical conditions and medications can influence orgasms

**Diagnostic Considerations:**
- Substance / Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction if problems are side effects (see Section 13.8)
- Approximately 10% of women do not experience orgasm throughout their lifetime

**Case Study: Lola Alvarez**
- Inability to experience orgasms despite sufficient stimulation
- Anxiety about losing control and expressing anger or hostility
- No mental disorder, general medical condition, substance abuse, or medication use apparent
- Persistent problem causing distress

- Marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during intercourse or penetration attempts
- Fear and anxiety about potential pain before, during, or after vaginal penetration
- Involuntary tensing of pelvic floor muscles (vaginismus) during attempted penetration

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- Not explained by another mental disorder
- No relationship distress or partner violence
- No general medical condition causing pain or infertility
- No medication side effect

**Prevalence and Demographics:**
- Prevalence unknown, approximately 15% of women in North America report recurrent pain during intercourse
- Diagnosed only for women, but urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men is a related condition

**Case Study: Claire Whitaker's Story**
- Unable to allow vaginal penetration since marriage due to spasms and anxiety
- Previous therapy helped with episodic intercourse, but fear of pregnancy remained
- History of chronic endometriosis, premature birth, religious upbringing, lack of education on sexual health
- Treatment included couple sessions for husband's frustration and cooperation, individual sessions, antianxiety medication, vaginal dilation exercises.

**Treatment Approach:**
- Addressing anxiety related to vaginal penetration through therapy and medication
- Gradual vaginal dilation exercises in warm water to improve comfort with body
- Sensate focus exercises for pleasure without intercourse
- Group therapy for nonorgasmic women for additional support.

### 13.8 Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction

**Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunctions**
* Wide range of medications and substances can cause sexual dysfunctions
* Antidepressants: most commonly cause problems with orgasm or ejaculation, desire, and erection
	- 25% to 80% of individuals report sexual side effects
	- Antipsychotic medications, antianxiety agents also cause sexual side effects
	- Other medications associated with sexual dysfunction: statins, blood pressure medications, histamine type 2 receptor blockers, anticonvulsant medications, hormonal contraceptives
* Illicit substance use can lead to sexual problems, especially among chronic drug abusers
	- Higher rates of erectile dysfunction in individuals who abuse heroin (approximately 60%-70%) compared to amphetamines or ecstasy
	- Chronic alcohol abuse and nicotine abuse linked to higher rates of erectile problems
* Premature ejaculation can sometimes occur after cessation of opioid use
* Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunctions are usually reversible by lowering dosage or stopping the medication

**Case Study: "Bad Side Effect"**
* Amy Harris, 36-year-old bank officer, experiences extreme difficulty reaching orgasm
	- Orgasmic capacity in her teenage years and early 20s
	- Loss of sexual interest after husband's affair and non-promotion at work
	- Diagnosed with Major Depressive Episode
	- Treated with antidepressant medication, Paroxetine 20 mg/day
	- Orgasmic difficulties worsened when dosage was increased to 40 mg/day and returned after lowering the dose again to 20 mg/day
* Diagnosis: Paroxetine-Induced Sexual Dysfunction (DSM-5, p. 446)

## CHAPTER 14 Gender Dysphoria

**Gender Dysphoria**

**Definition:**
- Gender: publicly recognized lived role as boy or girl, man or woman
- Sex: biological indicators of male and female (reproductive capacity, sex chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, external genitalia)

- Convinction that one has feelings and reactions of other gender.

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- DSM-5 presents two lists for children (prepubescent) and adults

- Nonspecific abnormality on EEG suggests underlying central nervous system issue
- Potential for child abuse due to violent behavior towards children
- Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) or Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) considered as possible causes, but no history of severe head trauma.

**Discussion and Conclusion**
- Ms. Fortunato's behavior suggests Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED)
- Diagnosis hinges on the frequency and severity of outbursts, potential for child abuse
- EEG abnormality may indicate underlying central nervous system issue
- Further testing needed to rule out other neurological disorders like TBI or CTE.

### 15.3 Conduct Disorder

**Conduct Disorder**

**Definition:**
- Repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior violating others' rights or societal norms (DSM-5, p. 469)

**Diagnostic Criteria:**

4. **Serious violations of rules**: staying out past curfew; truancy; running away from home

**Subtypes:**
- **Childhood-Onset Type**: symptoms appear before age 10, more aggressive behavior, poorer prognosis
- **Adolescent-Onset Type**: no symptom before age 10, less severe behavior, better prognosis

**Additional Specifiers:**
- **With Limited Prosocial Emotions**: callousness, lack of empathy, insincere emotions, poor prognosis

**Severity:**
- Mild: few conduct problems causing minor harm to others

- Parents unable to control her.

**Hospitalization:**
- Befriended other adolescents but demanding and emotionally volatile.
- Stormed out of community meetings when disagrees with decisions.

## CHAPTER 16 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders

**Substance-Related Disorders**

**Drug Classes (simplified)**:
- Depressants: alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics
- Stimulants: controlled substances (amphetamine and cocaine), caffeine and tobacco
- Cannabis
- Hallucinogens: phencyclidine (PCP) and other hallucinogens
- Opiods
- Inhalants and other drugs (inhalants, anabolic steroids, etc.)

**Gambling Disorder**: 
- Presented alongside Substance-Related Disorders due to similarities in reward systems and behavioral symptoms

**Substance Use vs. Induced Disorders**:
- **Substance Use Disorder**: Problems with substance use leading to impairment or distress
- **Substance-Induced Disorder**: Psychological or behavioral symptoms caused by direct effects of the substance on the central nervous system

**Co-occurrence of Disorders**:
- Substance Use Disorder and Substance-Induced Disorder can co-occur, but are distinct conditions

**Substance Classes Associated with Specific Disorders**:
- Table 16-1: Depressants, stimulants, cannabis, hallucinogens, opioids, and inhalants/other drugs associated with Substance Use Disorder, Substance Intoxication, or Substance Withdrawal

##### Substance Use Disorders

**Substance Use Disorders**

**Characteristics:**
- Cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms
- Individual continues using substance despite significant problems
- Underlying brain circuitry change may persist beyond abstinence
- Prone to repeated relapses and intense drug craving

**Diagnostic Criteria (DSM-5):**
1. Impaired control over substance use:
   - Exceed own preset limits
   - Persistent desire to cut down or regulate use
   - Spend significant time obtaining or using the substance
2. Social and occupational impairment:
   - Unable to fulfill major role obligations due to substance use
   - Continue use despite social/interpersonal problems caused by substance use
   - Give up important activities because of substance use
3. Risky use of the substance:
   - Repeatedly use in physically hazardous situations
   - Continue use despite physical or psychological problems caused by substance use
4. Physiological dependence on the substance:
   - Tolerance (increased amount or reduced effect)
   - Withdrawal symptoms when stopping use

**Classes of Substances:**
- Depressant drugs: Hand tremor, sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, agitation, fever
- Opioid drugs: Withdrawal symptoms less obvious but can involve dysphoric mood and fatigue
- Stimulants or cannabis: Less obvious withdrawal, involving dysphoric mood and fatigue
- PCP and other hallucinogens/inhalants: No documented significant withdrawal symptoms in humans

**Medication Abuse:**
- If tolerance and withdrawal develop during appropriate medical treatment, do not count toward diagnosis if taken as prescribed
- However, if taken at higher doses or more often than prescribed, should be considered part of the diagnosis.

**Severity Levels:**
- Mild: 2 to 3 symptoms
- Moderate: 4 to 5 symptoms
- Severe: 6 or more symptoms

**Remission Status:**
- Early Remission: No criteria met for at least 3 months but less than 12 months
- Sustained Remission: No criteria met for 12 months or longer.

##### Substance-Induced Disorders

**Substance-Induced Disorders**

**Types of Substance-Induced Disorders:**
- **Substance Intoxication**:
    * Diagnosed during use of a substance
    * Causes problematic behavioral or psychological changes
    * Symptoms depend on specific substance: alcohol, sedative drugs, anxiolytic medication, caffeine
        + Alcohol: inappropriate sexual or aggressive behavior, mood lability, impaired judgment, slurred speech, incoordination, impairment in attention and memory
        + Caffeine: restlessness, nervousness, excitement, insomnia, flushed face, sweating, muscle twitching, increased heart rate, rambling flow of thought and speech
    * Common among those with Substance Use Disorder but also occurs in individuals without one
- **Substance Withdrawal**:
    * Develops after prolonged use of a substance
    * Characterized by substance-specific behavioral changes and physiological and cognitive disturbances
    * Symptoms often the opposite of intoxication symptoms: dysphoric mood, fatigue, increased appetite (stimulants vs. depressants)
    * Associated with Substance Use Disorder but can develop without one
- **Substance/Medication-Induced Mental Disorders**:
    * Potentially severe and temporary psychiatric syndromes caused by substances of abuse, medications, or toxins
    * Nine specific types: Psychotic Disorder, Bipolar and Related Disorder, Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder, Sleep Disorder, Sexual Dysfunction, Delirium (Substance-Induced, Substance Withdrawal, Medication-Induced), Neurocognitive Disorder
    * Not all combinations of substances and mental disorders exist due to specific substance effects on psychiatric symptoms.

##### DEPRESSANTS

**Depressants**
* Drugs that lower neurotransmission levels, reducing arousal or stimulation in the brain
* Two DSM-5 drug classes included: Alcohol-Related Disorders and Sedative-, Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic-Related Disorders
* Reasons for grouping together:
  * Both alcohol and sedative, hypnotic, and anxiolytic medications are brain depressants, resulting in behavioral sedation
  * Both act on the same cell receptors in the brain
  * Cross-tolerance between alcohol and sedative, hypnotic, and anxiolytic medications (e.g., tolerance to alcohol also applies to these medications)
* DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for Alcohol Intoxication and Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication, as well as Alcohol Withdrawal and Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal, are nearly identical.

- Includes benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like medications (e.g., diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam, alprazolam, zolpidem, zaleplon)
- Some historical uses: carbamates (meprobamate), barbiturates (secobarbital), and barbiturate-like sleep aids (methaqualone)
- Available by prescription and illegally
- High liability to cause addiction or death from overdose compared to modern medications

**Disorders:**
- Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder
  * Onset in teens or 20s

- Ms. Dudek had increased her diazepam dosage to 90 mg/day despite experiencing shakiness, weakness, difficulty sleeping, and anxiety.
- She was absent from work due to feeling hungover or exhausted in the morning.
- Attempted treatments with carbamazepine, amitriptyline, and imipramine resulted in short-term relief but also side effects.

**DSM-5 Definition**: Cannabis refers to all forms of cannabis-like substances, including synthetic cannabinoid compounds. Synthetic oral formulations of THC are available by prescription for medical indications like nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. Other synthetic cannabinoid compounds have been manufactured for nonmedical use in the form of plant material sprayed with a cannabinoid formulation (e.g., K2, Spice).

**Forms of Cannabis**:
- Smoked or ingested orally
- Vaporized: heats plant material to release psychoactive cannabinoids for inhalation

**Cannabis Use Disorder and Cannabis-Induced Disorders**:
- Problems associated with substances derived from the cannabis plant and chemically similar synthetic compounds
- Commonly smoked but sometimes ingested orally
- Onset of intoxication: minutes if smoked vs. hours for oral ingestion

  - Perceived marijuana as successfully treating anxiety, leading to the return of symptoms after cessation appearing as part of a withdrawal

**Cannabis Withdrawal Syndrome**:
- Only introduced in DSM-5 in 2013
- Symptoms can include irritability, anger, depression, anxiety, loss of appetite, vivid dreams, restlessness, and physical symptoms like sweating, tremors, and nausea. (Source: DSM-5, p. 517)

##### HALLUCINOGENS

**Phencyclidine-Related Disorders**

**Hallucinogens**:
- Group of substances that produce similar alterations in perception, mood, and cognition
- Includes PCP and related substances (e.g., ketamine, cyclohexamine, dizocilpine)
- Lack a well-defined withdrawal syndrome in humans

**Phencyclidine (PCP) Intoxication**:
- Characterized by disorientation, confusion, hallucinations or delusions, catatonic-like syndrome, and coma
- Primary effects last for only a few hours, but can persist for weeks in vulnerable individuals, precipitating a persistent psychotic episode

**Prevalence of Phencyclidine Use Disorder**:

- Phenylalkylamines (e.g., mescaline) and MDMA
- Indole-amines (e.g., psilocybin, DMT)
- Ergolines (e.g., LSD, morning glory seeds)
- Cannabis and THC are not considered hallucinogens in DSM-5 due to differences in effects

**Duration of Effects**:
- Some hallucinogens have extended duration (LSD, MDMA)
- Others are short-acting (DMT)

## CHAPTER 18 Personality Disorders

**Personality Disorders**
* Among most impairing mental disorders
* Difficult to diagnose
* Challenging to treat

**Characteristics of Personality Disorders**:
- Significant problems in self-appraisal and self-regulation
- Impaired interpersonal relationships
- Up to 50% of clinical patients have a Personality Disorder
- Co-occur with other mental disorders

**DSM-5 Models for Personality Disorders**:
1. **Main Section (Section I)**: Defined as an enduring pattern of deviant behavior, thought, and emotion that leads to distress or impairment. Manifested in two or more areas: cognition, affectivity, interpersonal functioning, impulse control.
2. **Alternative Model (Section III)**: Characterized by impairments in personality functioning and pathological personality traits. Impairments in personality functioning identify core features of personality psychopathology. Pathological personality traits manifest in presentations of personality pathology. Personality Disorders are relatively stable, with a tendency toward improvement or remission over time.

**Co-occurrence of Mental Disorders**:
- Symptoms may vary together, leading to attempts to understand organization of psychopathology through dimensions like internalizing, externalizing, and thought disorder spectra
- Disorders within these broad domains share risk factors, cognitive/emotional processing abnormalities, and respond to similar treatments

**DSM-5 Alternative Model of Personality Disorders**: Describes personality pathology in terms of five broad trait domains: Negative Affectivity, Detachment, Antagonism, Disinhibition, Psychoticism. Each domain includes specific facets as defined below.

- Hostility: Persistent anger, irritability, and vengeful behavior
- Perseveration: Continued behavior despite failure or lack of reason
- Depressivity: Feelings of being down, hopeless, with deficits in pleasure and self-worth

**Detachment**:
